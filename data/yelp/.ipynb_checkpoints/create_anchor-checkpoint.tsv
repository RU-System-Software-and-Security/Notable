Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.	1
I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!	0
"All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The \""Wet Cajun\"" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!\n\nThe dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer's dream!!  \""Pittsburgh Dad\"" would love this place n'at!!"	1
Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.	0
This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be.	0
Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nIt's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. \n\nThe guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. \n\nA big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....\n\nPrice for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again.	1
I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!	1
After waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program, our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction. This led to us waiting another 30 minutes for him to correct it. Don't visit this store if you want pleasant or good service.	0
Wonderful reuben.  Map shown on Yelp page is incorrect. It is actually a different Hawkins.  I'd recommend a call for directions 412-271-9911.	1
This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back.	1
Awesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday!	1
Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting.	0
"Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don\""t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good."	0
"I got 'new' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \nI took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire \""this time\"". \nI will never go back to Flynn's b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!"	0
Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time.	0
I've been informed by a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season, I hope they're right! I find it strange they don't keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didn't cover the course up to protect it from weather, vandalism, etc. Either way, I can't wait to get my game on in the spring!	1
Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing.	0
Hoofah.	0
Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on.	0
If you are searching for a go to fish place for Lent....look no further.  This place will give you the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  The sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches.  You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating.\nEnjoy....	1
Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky's	1
Good Luck getting a seat, that's all I have to say. The Gab and Eat is famous and infamous. Diner food is what's up and I like it. When I was a roofing mechanic, we'd meet there before work. Although I'm not sure I would recommend it if you're working were there's no bathrooms. hehe	1
The biggest breakfast in Pittsburgh, as far as I can tell - and delicious and cheap too. I ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. Oh, and a side of toast. For under $5, if I recall.\n\nHUGE portions, all well-executed; as good as DeLuca's.\n\nI've not had anything besides breakfast, so can't comment on the burger or anything else.\n\nCramped quarters, and you'll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination.	1
Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!	1
I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. \n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.\n-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)\n-Cash only\n-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack\n-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.\n-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo	1
Definitely a greasy spoon! Always packed here and always a wait but worth it. The omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage. I also like the mixed grill.  My parents love their burgers. Took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive.	1
Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious.	1
"I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \n\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\""  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\n\nWe want to return sometime for \""turkey day.\""  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\n\nCan't wait to return."	1
Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  \n\nBarb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.\n\nI know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try!	1
Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here.	1
"I've stayed at a couple of Extended Stay sites that I found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good. Excellent place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh. It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. \n\nThe rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state \""full kitchen\"" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. \n\nThe room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. \n\nThe best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.  I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it."	1
Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \n\nTo recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\n\nIt's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \n\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \n\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \n\nGet it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons.	0
The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.\n\nRather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.\n\nThe driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. \n\nSo I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.\n\nI would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town.	0
This is by far the best dentist I have ever been to.  She is honest and never trys to sell you a bunch a stuff that you dont need. We are very great full that we discovered her. We adjust our vacations to make sure that we stop in to her office in Pennsylvania at least once a year for cleaning and check ups, worth the drive from Florida.	1
I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else	0
Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food.	0
I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \n\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \n\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \n\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking.	0
All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\n\nOur food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\n\nWe asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?\n\nOver all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so.	0
We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back.	0
Went for breakfast on 6/16/14. We received very good service and meal came within a few minutes.Waitress could have smiled more but was friendly. \nI had a Grand Slam... it was more than enough food. \nMeal was very tasty... We will definitely go back. \nIt is a popular Denny's.	1
Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!\nStrawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) \nStrawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!\nIts always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around. \nIf you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!	1
I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!	1
I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?	0
If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!!	0
Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN.	1
Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.\n\nLike the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.  \n\nThe bar was jumping thou never go to the bar.	1
Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!	0
Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.  \n\nThe bar was jumping when I picked up our order.\n\nThe white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time.	1
OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. \n\nAdvice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\n\nJust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service.	1
Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try.	1
This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious. I suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store (in the section where you can buy stuff to take home). It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness.	1
"Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.\n\nI ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  \n\nAmbiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of \""musts\"" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit!"	0
"Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are \""just\"" working . They have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. Consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . Nothing is served on the side with main dishes ...."	0
Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood	0
Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie.	0
I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  \n\nI was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\n\nOrdered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back.	1
"Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  Decided to try it again since it is close to Stage 62.  Big mistake.  Greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?\"" and said they had a busy night.  This is when tables around us sat empty. I then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  The bill was prepared incorrectly. If you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  We will never go back."	0
Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG.	0
Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.	0
I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional, rude and have no clue what they're doing (behind the desk). I will not be going back nor will I have nice things to say about them.	0
The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time.	0
Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. When we came, half of the menu board was still on breakfast, and it was 4:30p. The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. \n\nThen again, the franchise is owned by Rice, and I've come to take terrible service is their MO.	0
"This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  \n\nOrder:  Big mac, large fries, diet coke.\n\nThe soda machine was broken.   No sodas.\n\nThen I got to the window.  \""We rang you up for medium fries.\""   (Not what I asked for)  \""Well, if you want a large, you're gonna have to wait 4 minutes.  We just started a new batch.\""\n\nLeft with:  Big mac, medium fries, no coke.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, this was one of my better experiences there..."	0
Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.  How can I stay mad when the prices or so cheep? Myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00\n\nOn this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at Eatn' Park.\n\nMy baked potato was hard as a rock, I had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. \n\nThe waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which I thought was sweet.	0
Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks: \n\n1. Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty, compared to the other Starbucks I have been in.\n\n2. If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.\n\nAside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service.	0
"If there was ever a \""get your coffee and go\"" Starbucks, this is it. Right in the center of the Waterfront, this Starbucks has no sofa, comfy chairs, only table seating. I love the baristas here, But I don't like the location of the building."	0
Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.	1
Regarding quality of beverage, this is just your average Starbucks. I can't complain but am not blown away either. However, I really like the location of this shop, which is located in the center of The Waterfront's specialty retail shops. Though in the midst of a lot of retail, the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass, flowers, and a fountain. Hanging out here is very relaxing.	1
This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\n\nSeating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\n\nBaristas are friendly and fast.	0
I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.	0
It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend.	1
The food is good and its CHEAP.\n\nI mean REALLY INEXPENSIVE.\n\n$4.00 for a burger and fries. Add a coke and its like $10.00-$13.00 for two people.  Seldom if ever crowded. \n\nService can be a tad slow but hit or miss.\n\nThey also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.\n\nTry the shakes, they're great.	1
This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. \n\nThe bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\n\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\n\nI think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...\n\n\n\nPS. The whole joint smells like major B.O.	0
I went here at 3 PM between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme to go. I thought I would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.\n\nLong story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier.	0
Well... as Steak 'n Shake locations go, this isn't the best one around--but it is burgers and fries that are open 24-7.\n\nThe milkshakes are good!\n\nPROS: \nAlways made fresh, when you order;\n\nCONS:\nGreasy (but its burgers);\nTakes longer than typical in drive thru (but that's bc they're made fresh!);\nService (on a scale of 1-10, 10 being awesome) is a 4.	0
In general I do like Shake N' Steak, but this location is a hit or miss location!  You never know what kind of quality or service you're going to find here.  A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER!  You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. However, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  The burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...\n\nBy far my worst visit to Steak n' Shake!	0
Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  Oh well!	0
The only thing worse than the food is the service.	0
Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high. \n  \n  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging.	0
This place is s l o w....like so slow I have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server. The food is okay. Def not worth the wait. Milkshakes are just okay as well. Booooooo.	0
I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service.	0
Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds.	0
The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \n\nThe burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed.	0
I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there.	0
I like the occasional steak and shake stop.....    but this one has to be the slowest one ever.    The cashier was rude and I could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted....     wow.... just wow...	0
Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour.	0
Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order.	0
This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  I've had pretty good experiences inside, it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  \n\nIt's the rare place I can get a Frisco Melt well, the ONLY place I can get a Frisco Melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk, Walk In OR Drive Thru.\n\nJust take a gun on Weekends, you'll be fine.	0
"This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \""doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?\"" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers."	0
"Nice staff but apparently there is little manager oversight around 3:28am.\n\nI do like this place.  It must be nice to work somewhere that allows you to choose your own tasks.  Like smoking, sitting and texting.  I'm fine with cooking my food being fourth on the \""to do\"" list because there is no where else togo really....\n\nWhy didn't they answer me at the drive through? I think they wanted me to come inside because my girlfriend and I are really really really good looking.\n\nThis was annoying but understandable."	0
It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders, and I got 3 little tiny tenders, and a decent amount of fries. Also the restaurant is not really clean either.  This restaurant is not my number 1 choice.	0
Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!	1
This is probably my favorite store in Pittsburgh, for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing. Other stores carry the same stuff but for much, much more, and it's hard to find all the stuff that the Basement carries in one spot. (Yes, I admit that the 'burgh has some cool stores.) I would do most of my clothes shopping here if I were here more often.	1
Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question?	0
"$9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry, I thought I was in Pittsburgh, not New York City. Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \""Paradise City\"" with the rest of the crowd."	0
In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.\n\nThe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.	0
If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! They aim to please :) I have definitely been pleased :)	1
This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.	0
Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \n\nShut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. \n\nMy big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.	1
"I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \""you bitch, you slut, you whore\"" and  \""twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt\"" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not."	0
He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls.	0
I brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper.  The damage was minimal, but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting.  The staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck.  They completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job.  A few weeks later, I noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question.  I would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done.	1
This is the best place we've ever taken our cars to. Their customer service is outstanding. It appears that they really like doing what they do because they are always willing to explain everything in detail. I also like that they don't over charge. I completely trust them to be honest and do the best job possible.	1
When making a Customer's paymento atLowe's, we have our checklist:\n\n1. Do the phone numbers match?  Nope, but that's fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways.\n2. Does the name on account match name on check?  Nope, but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies.\n3. Does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen?  Why should it, those computers are always making mistakes.\n\nNow that we have verified that all the information is correct, we can process the payment.  The customer will be so happy that we didn't have to bother them with any silly questions.\n\n******\nI am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence.  What was originally an average Lowe's has turned into Lowe's Hell.  If the associates do not have basic logic comprehension, how do they survive?	0
Would like to give NO STARS.  bought all new kitchen appliances there.  Refrigerator is defective.  They\nsend an outside company to repair.  Man arrives with NO TOOLS and wrong size seal for freezer.  not once, twice.  The first time, he tries to use my spoon from counter to install it!  I complain, too bad...they have to comeTHREE times before replacing it!  NEVER AGAIN.	0
Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's for lawn and garden.  Hate to admit it, but it's true.	1
This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.	0
There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front.	0
One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. Friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family.	1
Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.\n\nMy mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.  \n\nI like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead.	0
Dave and Buster's is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \n\nNext, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. \n\nThe games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\n\nOverall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.	0
The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! \n\nOur waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   \n\nThe manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free.	0
Not much of a review for this one, but just a few tidbits of info...\n\nPool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour\n(I'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)\n\nMixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.\nThe food is crap.\n\nThe games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size, not the shitty bar-room, tiny pool tables).\n\nThat is all.  :)\n\n(the pricing is based on my recent trip.\nWe shot pool for a few hours, I had a bar tab (that wasn't out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60	0
This place just plain sucks\nBad management lost them biz\nDumb arcade drama*\n\n* they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old	0
Visiting from Toronto, I was really impressed! The amount of tickets to be won was incredible. We usually got 200 tickets per play on average. Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food.	1
Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service	0
Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back.	0
I still love this place!  I spent my 36th birthday at D&B's and it was a wise decision!  i had so much fun, and so did my guest!  I got a very attentive serving staff, and met up with many helpful servers!  I believe that service has improved, so I bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars!  No five stars yet, because I've still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it!  It's still worth the visit, and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price!	1
I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat.	0
My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though, everything was below average. They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced.	0
Horrible beer, horrible service, horrible menu	0
SUMMARY:\nIf I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.\n\nGOOD:\n- Decent beer...\n- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.\n- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\n- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\n- Amusing name.\n\nBAD:\n- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\n- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\n- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\n\nCome if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.	0
"Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \""kind of like Coors Light\"".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  \n\nThe food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though."	0
My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around.	0
Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom.	0
Pretty good! Excellent beer sampler - bargain!  Veggie burger awesome. Onion rings awesome. Fried Mac n cheese was delicious - crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious.	1
Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly.	1
I love this place!  Great atmosphere and friendly service every time I go!!	1
"I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \""brewery\"" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!"	0
For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.	0
"I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \""nice\"" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.\n\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\n\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future."	0
Slow service\nBelow average food \nIll pass	0
First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend. I had the chicken avacod sandwich.  It was very good.  No fat in the chicken.  Just a mess to eat, but still awesome.   Also had the chocolate stout cupcake, it was amazing.	1
"Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \""OK\"".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \n\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\n\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens!"	0
I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.   The food was delicious,  the beer, every recipe sampled,  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. \n\nPlease support this business.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.	1
Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.	0
I'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. Their nachos is pretty good. I also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well. \nI think the only thing I did't like is the steak taco appetizer. It was too sour and kinda tasteless.	1
Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.	1
My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese.   Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat.	1
Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money.\n\nOn to the important part... Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic.	0
The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\u00f6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.	0
"The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \""foodie\"" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it."	0
Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around.	0
I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. \n\nI prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. \n\nNachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer. \n\nThis is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection. \n\nThey have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. \n\nService is always great whether there are two or 10 of us.	1
BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. \n\nI came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalape\u00f1o cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work.	1
I always enjoy a good comedy club and though I'm a loyal Helium fan, I gotta give props to the Improv near Pittsburgh. They chose a great location, with surrounding restaurants of all genres and fun bars and shopping. \n\nWe bought tickets to see a comedian I had never heard of (he was decent) for $25 each with a two item purchase minimum. I really dislike that rule but you can't really get around it. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like, aka hated, was having to wait in line outside before the show started. It was freeeeezing! They should put heaters outside. seriously.	1
My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.	0
I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!	1
Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back.	1
So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had\nMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fianc\u00e9s chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible, in fact, she didn't eat more than 3 pieces of it. Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better.	0
Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection.	1
As far as GE's go, this location is great. It has basically everything you need and is well organized. You can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you can't get at other GE stores. They also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. I would venture to say this is better than the market district.	1
Waterfront Geagle is my primary market. Now that they've expanded and reorganized, I rarely even have to set foot in Target anymore. Yippie! There's a wine kiosk (suck it PA liquor laws), you can buy crazy expensive 6 packs, cheese market, bakery, salad and hot bar, butcher, florist, dry cleaners, international foods, pharmacy, and a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. They usually have a sufficient number of lanes open, and it doesn't get nearly as crowded as Market District. I do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion, but you can't always get what you want, I suppose.	1
This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here.	0
Just about every you need.\n\nWith great hours, a solid hot bar, sushi (if you're into that),  a dry cleaning service, pharmacy, tons of produce, bakery and butchers counter you can't go wrong. Two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front. I always have to walk to a lane and hunt for a basket then double back, super annoying. \n\nThat said its a small, and easily repairable (hint) issue that shouldn't keep you from visiting.	1
Barnes & Noble, it's like the Wal-Mart of bookstores.  Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \n\nI'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\n\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.	0
"Fantastic food.\n This place is mainly a \""bar\"" and does get crowded but I really like the pizza here.  In fact I've never had a bad meal.  The staff are ussually very helpful but it does get a bit loud inside when crowded."	1
"The words \""epic fail\"" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.\n\nWe went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\n\nThe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\n\nBy 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.\n\nInstead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.\n\nBar Louie:  You are dead to me."	0
When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!\n\nNothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.	0
I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\n\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \n\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.	0
The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!	0
haha only came here once for happy hour, but i am just pleased with the price. i guess coming from ny, anything would be better price wise. $3 for draft and a big selection of beers so good times. also it's right across the theater so it's a good place to go and chill before the movie starts.. which is exactly what i did haha.	1
This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \n\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.	0
Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever.	0
Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \n\nIt's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \n\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\n\nI'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.	0
We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.\nBoth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.\nCan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself.	0
I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street.	0
The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!	0
Food is Shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly.  Staff is ok no complaints drinks are good as well	0
Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.\n\nBobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait.	0
Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality.	0
It's fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. The lazy river could be much better. I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location.	0
"Dont waste your time with this place.  Long lines, overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait. Half the \""rides\"" were shut down. You're better off with a garden hose. Save your money or buddy up to someone with a pool."	0
For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. \n\nABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon.	1
After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great. Driver was very courteous and on time. We used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy. The driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment.	1
Fabulous service all around. My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn't going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. \n\nMy husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!	1
"The worse \""Chinese food\"", even the white rice which came with the ogle sweet and sour chicken is really bad.  Please don't eat this food."	0
Haven't been to TGIFridays for years and was never really a huge fan. I get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out. I must say that I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. I had the two for $10 lunch special with French onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. I was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so I opted for the French onion. It was okay but I think that I would get a salad instead of the soup next time. The chicken strips were wonderful and I am still craving them. The portion was huge and there were leftovers. My co-workers ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. The service was good and we had no issues. I will definitely be back.	1
This place.. Is ok if ur grabn something quick .. But they do have a great happy hour tho	0
Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.	0
"I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the \""chain\"" expectation. \n\nI order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.\n\nFortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. \n\nI'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day."	0
I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average!	0
Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Maybe they were short handed.  The food was to me not even average. I ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalape\u00f1o slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.	0
Good food.  \n\nI guess one reason I like this place is they don't hide how bad the food is for you. There is a little Kiosk with all the calories right by the door.  All in all I get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy them\n\nThe steaks are also good and the price is reasonable.\n\nService is always friendly and the establishment is kept really clean and neat	1
I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think, this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. First, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. Guess what? Chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!	0
Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!	0
I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\n\nFrench onion\nChicken bites\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\n\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \n\nI really never want to return.	0
Food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side Ass mashed potatoes. Everything was ok not a lot of flavor.	0
Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.	0
The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. The personal pizzas alone were $11 each... If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good.	0
Wham! 4 stars outta the park! The deep-dish pizza we had was amazing. I wasn't crazy about the avocado egg rolls, but the chocolate chip sundae was superb. Great service too from Maranda, a doll. Decor is cute. Ambience is lively. Recommended.	1
"Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza was good. But the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!\nWe were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).\nLater when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said \""okay\"", not even a sorry once!!!\nI would not like to go there again... :("	0
Nope!	0
Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well	0
Nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a 2 for 12 but that's not what the online menu states. And it's a salad come on..	0
I hate this place.\nIt's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.\nIf you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service.	0
My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet.\n\nVegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu.\nWarning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.\n\nThey also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.\n\nI always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals.\n\nThe service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go.	1
The service was lackluster. Coffee was warm but delicious. Limited to one cup, apparently, as the waitress never offered a second.\n\nDaughter had sweet and sour shrimp. Wife had spicy chicken. I had wonton soup. Dumplings as an appetizer for the table. All arrived warm. The brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. Also dry as sand. I guess that is how they serve it.\n\nThe base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. I had expected them to be more diverse. \n\nIn all, expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. I'd rather have the local Chinese cuisine which more flavorful, and much less expensive.	0
"This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. \n\nThey were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \""Asian Bistro.\"""	0
"I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but \nThere was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. \nOne of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. \n\nReservations:\nOur party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.\n\nAt 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....\n\nWhen we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.\n\nMy Hot and sour soup is usally served with\""noodley\"" things that I drop in the soup. We weren't given any \""noodley \"" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart."	0
Let me start by saying that I do like their food. \n\nLast night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.\n(is that the way rice is prepared now?)\n\nI ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.\n\n4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.	0
ok so i've eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. now, i'll be honest this is the only one i've ever been to, so i don't know if they're all the same but every time i'm underwhelmed. i get there, look at their giant selection and get excited. then i get my meal and remember that i've never had anything too great. don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but for how much they charge, they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion. just saying...	0
Rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess. Drinks were not good. Greasy spring  rolls \n\nBelow par on every way.  No experience needed to work here	0
Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!	0
I seriously don't know why people love this place so much, the food here is horrible. The rice is never cooked properly.. And it's not even Asian food. It's fake asian food. I never come here anymore.	0
We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. Our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. I appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. \n\nI still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy.	1
Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy! Started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot! Lol. Tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave. Their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well... which is different bc you don't normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl.  By the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups, we were almost full. LOVE the way their Mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well. Definitely will be back because this place is clean, service is quick, food is delicious, and the price isn't so bad either.	1
We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(	0
Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.	1
I've had bad experiences here a few times now.  I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  Bad service all around!!!  Basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.  Really, you don't get much for what you pay for at panera.  Its not very good at all.	0
It's the same Panera food you've had before.  I like the other ones better as they are often  faster at preparing food than this one.  That said the food is fine and the staff is nice enough.\n\nThey have warm cookies for $2.00.  That is a nice feature.	1
Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to. I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. The first one looks delicious the second one looks like they could've used a smaller bowl. It did not even look appetizing.	0
The food was fine. It's a chain. I'm not rating it. \n\nThe service was absolutely horrible. It started well enough when we ordered lunch, but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. \n\nBetween being ignored by the girl at the counter, her not listening to the order, then arguing with me when I told her I did not ask for what she brought me, I really can't decide which is worse. I rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business, rather than take attitude from Panera employees.	0
"The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.  The vet checked the ears, teeth, and nails then called it a day.  \n\nI came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had a \""slab fracture\""  which was still attached to the gum.  The vet didn't mentioned it during the \""exam\"" other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth.\n\nI was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if they're going to charge me for a examination, they should do a proper examination.  I just felt I was rushed out of there. \n\nI took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture, gave me info on how it usually happens, potential problems that it can cause, and recommendations on ways to fix the problem."	0
After working for the rival of Target for years, Target has become my favorite mega chain store to shop at.  Although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores I'm still able to get in and get out in a hurry.  \n\nDepending on the time of day, it may be a task just to find a parking space due to the traffic light at the end of the road.  If you don't mind walking a bit, the aisle where the pharmacy sign is on the building usually has spots closer to the front of the store.\n\nThe only downside I can find for this location is the smell of overly burnt buttered popcorn as soon as you walk in due to the cafe location.  I prefer not to vomit as soon as I walk into a store, maybe after about ten minutes in I'd consider it.	1
Target is pretty standard. If you've been to one of them, you'll know largely what to expect from this one. That being said, this store is clean, and the deals one clearance can be good. Just make sure to check the circular and the website, as sometimes additional coupons can be found that the store personnel aren't aware of. \n\nThe electronics department staff are not very knowledgeable, and tried to pressure me into buying a different TV by repeating marketing lingo, but were unable to explain what their claims actually were when challenged on them, so make sure to do your research beforehand if purchasing electronics.	1
Target is one of my favorite stores -- I just love wandering around late at night when the store is quiet -- it's just so therapeutic! This location is now my closest store, so I drop by pretty often.\n\nThis store is pretty average. Inventory and customer service aren't particularly stellar but isn't poor either. I've generally been able to find what I need here and check out pretty quickly. \n\nIn addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department. Of the 10-15 locations in the Pittsburgh area, only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses. I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through Target Optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service.	1
I've been to many Targets and they're all the same. However, this particular one is currently being remodeled. Children's clothing, toys, electronics and health & beauty items have been moved to other parts of the store. There is a new Starbucks that is now open. The cafe that is there has been remodeled and will serve Pizza Hut pizza and other new menu items. The area where the electronics used to be it is now going to have a small grocery section. Basically, this Target in Homestead will eventually look like the one in East Liberty. I like this Target, so I am pleased with the new changes (especially Starbucks)!	1
Watch out when it looks like something is on sale.  They mark a rack or table with a big buy one get one or 50% off sign, then only some of the stuff on the rack is on sale.	0
It's not that delish.	0
This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere.	0
We just completed our wedding registry at the Homestead location. The customer service was outstanding! One of the employees, Chris, walked around with us to help us pick out exactly what we needed. The wedding registry coordinator, Christina, was also very helpful and accommodating. They treated us as if we were royalty. I would recommend this wedding registry without a doubt!	1
This is a very small, yet nice store. The associates are nice and helpful. Not much else to say about this particular store. Just a pleasure to purchase from...	1
Much like every other Eat 'n Park (3 or 4 stars worth of chain-diner food), except the last five times I've been here, the service has been damn, damn, daaaaaaaamn slow.  It's always fun to see the staff smoking out back while I've waited an hour for some scrambled eggs.	0
The food is usually pretty good, however the service is almost ALWAYS very VERY slow. Most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be. Although they still technically do their job, you can FEEL very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things. It's a hit and miss. Unless you know one of the servers and their schedules. The low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who aren't very pleasant.	0
God i hate eat n park. Only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish, except maybe the cheesteak. Only go if u have little kids	0
I enjoy this TJ Maxx location. I'm not sure that any TJ Maxx in Western PA has as good of a selection as the Johnstown TJ Maxx, (yes, that's right, I really did say Johnstown) but this one is pretty close. There is plenty of space, and there is a decent homegoods section as well. Not huge, but decent.\n\nThis location always has a few Bliss products, which makes it top notch in my opinion. I mean, where else can you get discounted Bliss products??\n\nI generally don't have a lot of success with shoes at TJ Maxx because they never seem that discounted to me, but I have struck gold at this location several times. Last summer I scored two pairs of Cole Haan wedges for under $40 at the beginning of summer, and I've had success with booties here as well. Great deals on shoes makes me a happy girl!\n\nAll in all, this is a great location, and one that I frequent at least a few times per month.	1
Decent size, decent selection, decent staff.\n\nI guess that can wholly sum this place up, it's decent.  As with many other stores that are like this, the product rotates depending on what doesn't sale well at other stores.  Can always snag a deal here.  I was able to pick up a pretty sweet Puma jacket for $10, can't beat that, right?\n\nThat being said, there are those times that you may not find anything as well.  So really don't get your hopes up if you are looking for a specific item.	1
Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more. All that to say, I consider shopping here a waste of time since I could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what I want and need. Sorry, Marshalls, but you're just OK to me.	0
Mtchells is one of the best fish places around.  I really like their Shanghi preparation of my fish. It's just delicious.\n\nThe establishment is always clean, the staff courteous and the fish, of course, fresh.  \n\nOddly enough one of my favorite things about going here besides the fish is the bread they give you.  It's always so warm and tasty.\n\nThe deserts are also very tasty.  I have gotten two that I really liked\n\nThey also have a three course fixed price option last I went that was a great value. I think it was $20/person for lunch.	1
An excellent choice for fresh, well prepared seafood located in the Waterfront area in Homestead.   I frequent this area for business travel, and you can't do much better without heading downtown.\n\nThe seafood is excellent, with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials, a raw bar, and a list of chef's specialties.  The house salad is sweet and delicious, and the 'shanghai' seafood preparation is delicious, healthy, and unique.  Try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.\n\nThere is a nice selection of regional beers on tap, a decent selections of wines, and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).  The deserts are adequate, though not a highlight.  \n\nIf you're on the Waterfront, you won't do better than this.  Enjoy!	1
This place has great seafood. The best in the area. I come here for seafood every time. Everything on their menu is good. Their menu changes all the time depending on what was in season. Appetizers are amazing like the raw oysters.  Their clam chowder is the best. Really creamy with lots of clams. Wonderful restaurant. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. We love coming to this restaurant. Don't forget a reservation on weekends. You will not get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you don't have one. We never get to the dessert. Always too full to eat dessert.   Forgot to take pictures.	1
Excellent service, great meal!  They had an excellent selection of seafood,  and I can't wait to dine again	1
We went here for Valentines Day after some traffic downtown made us miss our reservation somewhere else. We both loved it. The calamari is outstanding and if you get there before 7, they run happy hour which is half off apps and $3 beers. \n\nI had filet and crab cake and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcake was a good size. Atmosphere was good and busy but that is likely because of it being Valentines day. Despite the busyness, the wait staff was very attentive.\n\nMy wife's steak came out rare despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect medium level. We will def be back.	1
Went on a Saturday, 2 hour wait. food is good, I got some seafood gumbo to go and I won't do that again. Seemed like it didn't have any seafood in it.	1
Service was slow, but that was because one of our party insisted that the bartender, her favorite server, serve us in our private room for a party of 8.  The food and drinks were good and we woud return.	1
I am bummed about this- I had high hopes. Here's a rundown of the evening:\n\nPros:\n- super friendly waitress, Stephanie, who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout \n- yummy elderflower and pear beverage\n- lobster bisque was nice and lobster-y\n- hot delicious bread\n\nCons:\n- oysters were sketch. And I don't feel good about that. Stephanie brought us an order of East Coast oysters to replace the West Coast ones that we sent back.\n- fresh grated horseradish had NO flavor or heat- what's up with that?\n- scallops were meh- came with weird veggies, unevenly seared, and no real flavor. And at a whopping $25 a plate, I expect some nummers!\n\nI doubt we'll go back- for those prices, I would prefer McCormick's or Ruth's Chris.	0
Service an atmosphere was great. I had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. Much closer to bland than anything.	0
I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :(	0
I have always had a great dinner at Mitchell's but something has changed. Went there last night about 5:30, the place was maybe half full. We were seated and when it finally occurred to us that no one had been to the table at all to ask about drinks or even bring water, I started timing.... 14 minutes later we decided to leave. Told the hostess what had happened and got a blank stare.  Sorry but not going back there again.	0
The service was mostly friendly but I was disappointed in my meal. My meal was way over cooked. The soda was flat and the carbonation needed changed and I felt like we inconvenienced our server by asking for new ones.  Overall, I thought it was mediocre and I was expecting more for the prices.	0
Food was only ok. Had lobster bisque soup not to good. Had the shang Hai Seafood Sampler. The scallops were hard, over cooked. The samon was good. Shrimp had no flavor. I will say the service was the best. Our waiter was great!!	0
Love this place - they were very accommodating to me, Peanut and Gramma (she goes often).  Solid wine selection and Gramma says they make a good Margarita.  We all enjoyed all of our food as well.  Great view of the Mon too.	1
Love this place so much. The food is always so delicious always leave feeling extremely satisfied. The service is incredibly slow though, takes FOREVER to our meals! Even during lunch time when there's almost no one there.. I don't understand I always end up eating here for at LEAST two-four hours. Fish is always fresh, lobster is delicate and tasty, and surprisingly the steak is amazing as well. Clam chowder is rich and creamy-- perfect thickness! Love their salads as well. Definitely recommend this place for a date night :) pricey? Definitely, be prepared to spend at least $20/person!	1
First I would like to say that I was hesitant coming to another fish place recommended by some temporary coworkers since the last place they sent me to made terribly ill. \nThat being said, I came here and was delighted by my server Michael who was not only friendly but incredibly attentive and very sharp. \nI originally ordered the Mahi Mahi but alas, the ran out upon my ordering, in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge. Hence, the tuna. \nNow the tuna was amazing. Seared almost perfectly, with the rare flavor still intact. \nI would most definitely come back again and if I lived in the area, this would be one of my top spots.	1
I love Mitchell's Fish Market.  95% of the time, the food is amazing but, when they mess up, they move heaven and earth to make it better.  The last time we were at Mitchell's, I ordered the lobster and tenderloin skewers.  My lobster was underdone.  The server was amazing and replaced the lobster tail even though I had eaten most of it.  Then, to make our night even better, comped us a dessert.  It's that kind of stellar service that keeps us going back.	1
In the Homestead area of Pittsburgh. Seafood gumbo was very good.\nBroiled scallops were very good, partner had sea bass stuffed with lobster, also very good. Vegetable sides were not as good as the fish. With two glasses of wine the total was $83. In and out in an hour.\nI'd go back because the fish was that good	1
I love old navy clothing, it's vintage styling with good prices. Great jeans too, I love the painter's jeans.	1
After further consideration, this store does not deserve a 4 star review. The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. \n\nWhile shopping here on Friday, I was one of maybe 3-5 people in the store. I would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile. No one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold. To avoid inconveniencing the associates, I will be taking my Old Navy purchases online in the future.	0
I don't see to many options in Pittsburgh for sporting goods. Dick's seems to be the big chain for sporting paraphernalia in this neck of the woods. Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products.	0
"I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the worst Dick's location that I've ever been to. The selection is very limited for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.\n\nThe staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). \n\nThey do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a \""good\"" Dick's location."	0
A group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. We where the only normal people in this place. The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. Must I say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you.	0
By far the worst McDonald's in the world.  Employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter, to get your order correct.  Ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order, after waiting what seems an eternity.  I've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru, only to get home and find no beef patties on my Big Mac.  Save yourself the aggravation, and do not go here.	0
By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in the\nWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that, after your long wait in the drive thru, your order will most definitely be wrong.  Calls to the owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises own a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills.  They have all gone down hill in quality, service and cleanliness.  The owner has to be the problem.	0
Good pizza at a great price. The unique crust that's both crispy and airy is probably not for everybody, but our whole group liked it. The sauce is good too, light but with a good tomato flavor. \n\nThe best thing about this place is the management. They went out of their way for our group of seven and the food was out fast. And the prices: we fed everybody in under $40, with plenty of leftovers taken home.	1
Great customer service!!!	1
This place is the absolute BEST to purchase a bike! I have been searching for a bike for a while now and every place I have gone to have not been NEAR has helpful as Glenn. \nThe one guy in the shop helped pick me a bike for what I needed and Glenn fit me perfectly to the bike. They also helped me with the bike rack on my car and changed my bike saddle for me! Ohhhh and they gave me the best price on the bike and accessories!!!  Wonderful service. Absolutely will go back! ... Can't wait!	1
If you're in the market for a high quality bike, whether it be road, mountain, racing, or hybrid, go to see Glenn at BBB.  It's very clear that he loves his shop and his job.  I explained my needs and preferences to him and he quickly fitted me with a bike that suited my needs.   I actually bought my Trek 7300 over 3 years ago and I absolutely love it!  He sells only the highest quality bikes and equipment.  Highly recommended.	1
This place makes AWESOME pizza. Also, their Italian hoagies are great. The only problem is that they do not open until 4.	1
Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne, PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg, PA of all places. Where I am at, really there is no delivery but these guys did. They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg, Downtown, run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi. That pizza is/was MILES better than this. This crust, while thin, did not have flavor and was hard. The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like. The cheese was good. The sauce was meh. I've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering.	0
Pizza is very hit or miss. When the owners are there, it's really good. When they aren't, you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times. The pizza, even when plain, is very greasy. Way more than other places around. Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. Also they do not take credit or debit cards. There are better options.	0
Came here from PGH for the first time.  This bakery is legit.  I bought some Rye bread and Italian 5 grain.  Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate, extra chewy and humongous.  Delicious.\n\nAnd a sweet old lady serving em up.\n\nThe best.\n\nDelicious.	1
Years after the first reviewer came here, the quality is still great and deserving of more than 5 stars.\n\nThe people who work here and run this place are super friendly and really know their craft. The main owner took my order once and gave me some tips on how to cook the frozen pierogies at home. They turned out ok, but not as good as getting them fresh from the store. \n\nIt can be a bit of a drive from anywhere that's not McKees Rocks (Google Maps takes you through the hood) but it's worth it.	1
These pierogies are one of my favorite things in the world. They're freakin' amazing. The potato and jalapeno ones are my favorite. And I definitely think it's worth it to drive all the way out to McKees Rocks to get them. I like to get them frozen, and bring them home and smother them in butter.	1
Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back	0
Update: Get. The. Italian. Sausage. Pierogies. Holy crap. It will change your freaking life!	1
Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!	1
The experience was not that great. The lady taking the orders was nice, but not helpful with what to order. The owner kept her back turn to us the entire time, based on the pictures and news articles I read about her I thought she would have been more social. To what really matters we got #2 sampler and order of jalape\u00f1o pierogies and the Ruben pierogies a lot of food for two guys. Really had no idea what to expect. Haluski was good, the pierogies came Luke warm and soaked in oily butter. Like the cab driver said you can find better. I'd pass on this spot.	0
I was very disappointed in the quality of the pierogies and the haluski at Pierogies Plus.  I ordered them hot and I purchased enough so that I could have leftovers the next day.  When I got home and opened the containers, something smelled odd.  When I started to eat, it tasted just as odd.  As it turns out, what is referred to as 'butter sauce' is a misrepresentation of what it really is-----margarine, which I eliminated from my diet years ago because of the trans fats and the fact that any way you cut it, butter makes for a better product.  Sorry Allison B, ain't no butter here.  Margarine is used as a cost-cutting measure, and it just can't measure up.  I rinsed off the peirogies and browned them in some butter and my own onions.   The haluski got thrown away.  For the prices being charged for these products, the proprietor can well-afford to use butter.	0
Have been here two times after stopping at Mancini's Bakery. Have only had the Hamburger/Cheese/Bacon w/ fries but huge portions and great price. Great Quality also. Server is really nice also. Will be eating here again. Heard the Breakfast items are also great. Saw the waffles and pancakes....were huge!	1
Marges is tucked away in the delightful Pittsburgh neighborhood of Mckees Rocks. This place reminds me half of a diner from the 1950's, and half my grandmas kitchen.\n\nThe seating room is accommodation, the service prompt and courteous.The prices are fantastic and so is the food.\n\nI had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage, potatoes, eggs, and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. It was excellent. Ladies and Gents, I can put food away  like a champ and I still had leftovers.\n\nMy friend had a succulent, buttery French Toast. Simple, but they nailed it.\n\nI would return.	1
Great service, great food at a reasonable price!  The cheeseburger was as big as my head and delicious and the onion rings were just as good.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive and quick to refill drinks. Can't wait to go back!	1
Great small town breakfast spot Highly recommend George's Mixed Grill ... Delicious	1
They do great quality work. The only reason I did not give them five stars is for their lack of customer courtesy not once but twice. I am a very patient and understanding person, but being rude twice means you dont want my business and I tipped 20%.	0
Got my first tattoo here in 1993 and my second a couple weeks later. All these \nYears later they still look great. Haven't faded much and haven't\nHad em touched up. The shop is Professional and clean, I highly \nRecommend. Excellent quality work.	1
ewwww	0
"It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for \""holding back\"" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\n\nWhich hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\n\nA big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits."	0
Called for an arrangement for pickup, told the person who took my order that I would be able to pick the arrangement up at 5:30pm.  She asked if I could get there any earlier, I said I would try my best, but I work until 5pm, so maybe not.  She said ok.  \n\nComes to be 5pm and I get a call from a guy at the shop asking where I was!  The lady who took my order wrote down that I'd be there at 5pm.  I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \n\nArrangement was just OK.  I specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers, which they did, but they added strange colors with the orange... and some of the flowers were already a little wilted.  \n\nEven though the location is convenient, I will probably go elsewhere for a flower order next time.	0
i had a fantastic experience here. I got to the shop just before they weer about to close, but the owner was very gracious about creating an arrangement for me. The flowers were lovely. I would make a special trip just to purchase from this shop again.	1
The order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner. I saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement  wasn't even close to what was pictured on the website...a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement. I picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area. I am disappointed because I wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time. \n\nI will not order from this place again.	0
"Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!\n\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\n\nThe seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \""I taste like iodine\"" flavor.\n\nThe advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive)."	0
Excellent pizza - although the mushrooms were from a can. But the crust , sauce and rest of toppings on the Sicilian pizza were delicious. Nice family friendly	1
Service was very good..calzone was excellent.	1
Best pizza in the North Boros.  I can't make a trip to the area without stopping at Luigi's.  When I was a kid, the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza, but they've since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is still just as good.  I prefer the thin-crust, but the Sicilian is also excellent.  The fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great, too.  The calzones are tasty, but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone, you'll be disappointed.  Because it's Pittsburgh, the chicken salad comes with french fries.  I tend to opt for take-out, but there is also a mid-sized dining section.	1
I have been eating at Luigi's since before birth (my mom loves this stuff). The new location is nice, but I miss the coziness of the old place. \nThe food has been consistent through the transition, which happened a long while ago by the way. Also, I have read a few other reviews that said Luigi's has left but I talk with him every time I am in. Regardless this is a great family owned pizzeria and I recommend the calzone because it is generously stuffed with ricotta :).	1
Just ordered delivery from here. The soup was very good. I also would Recommend the specialty salad. I also was surprised at how quickly the order was delivered. It was delivered within a 1/2 an hour.	1
This place has great tasting food. I had a italian hoagie and it was great. The pizza is top notch.	1
I have never gotten an order correct from this specific McDonald's. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it is never, ever right. It is never quick. The staff is always rude. After trying at least 12-15 times over the past year, I've finally given up hope on this place. Do not recommend.	0
Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead.	0
"Whether you live in Ben Avon Heights, Brighton Heights - or anywhere in between - I urge you to try China Sea.  It is quite simply the best local Chinese delivery.  The people on the phone are helpful and friendly.  The delivery is always quoted at 45 minutes, yet the food always arrives earlier and is always unbelievably hot and fresh.  Some favorites of ours are the Kung Pao shrimp, pork lo mein and hot and sour soup.  I don't mean to compare China Sea to the higher end Chinese restaurants in our area.  It is not Sesame Inn or China Palace; it is not a \""date night out\"" sort of place. It most definitely is a cozy, inexpensive, good quality \""stay in and relax\"" go to.  Hope this helps!  Enjoy!\n\nps\nA few final thoughts while we were going back for seconds; they only use all white meat chicken in their dishes.\npps\nAlways look at their online coupons, you will get something free!"	1
"The pros:\nYou get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. \nThey have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. \n\n\nThe cons:\nThe woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. \nMy pork dumplings were \""fried\"" only on one side and were raw in the middle. \nEverything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. \nLeftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! \n\nIf you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout."	0
"If you have any common sense at all, please don't stay here.  Once, it almost burnt down...and I'm pretty sure most of the locals were chanting \""burn, baby, burn.\"""	0
Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty, just absolutely rank.	0
OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!!	0
I can't even rate this place! Its absolutely disgusting! I begged the health department to shut them down! I was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting! I woke up with bed bug bites all over my body! Just filthy! DO NOT STAY HERE!	0
Fair prices but good quality... And amazing designs that are custom made.... Plus gel and solar nails are available for those interested... Offers waxing services... Completely renovated and the spa pedicure chair is amazing...	1
My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.	0
I got a pedicure here. Not bad, they were pretty thorough. But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides (which was weird anyway). I hate to rate a local shop down, but man my toes hurt.	0
Yes!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nGreat service!\nGreat Food!\nLove the BYOB!!! ($5).	1
Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself. ( never good)  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair. Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair. I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. I just know to call and schedule things. it is a small business and I get it.  P.S. kids haircuts are only 10$ and My daughter loves it.	1
My daughter CAN'T pass by here without asking to get something.  All I can say is you had better bring your sweet tooth!	1
Got a key lime pie from this place. It was horrid. Icing was stale cake thick, crust was not even crunchy or had taste, and the key lime was weak. Pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or 2.	0
Everytime I eat at this location I end up with a sick stomach.  I don't have that problem at other Arby's.  The dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but I always get a sick stomach.  Maybe they should relook at their food prep.	0
Without question, this is my favorite thrift store in the greater Pittsburgh region. I find antique kitchenwares here that are older than my grandma, worth $85 if the antique mall is to be believed, and priced at $2.50. The 50%-off sales actually pay off here. The merchandise turns over quickly. The staff is a real cast of characters (don't miss the steelers tattoos!!! i'm seriously serious, they are amazing). there are bicycles for you and your kids in decent-semi-working condition. The balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. The prices are reasonable to cheap. The plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. The kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. Most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. The remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot. \n\nI have spent, cumulatively, probably  several weeks of my life in this store. This is, hands-down, without question, the thing I miss most about leaving Pittsburgh. This store is the largest single contributor to my wardrobe, outside of H&M.	1
I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh!	0
Love the store. Great stuff, High price. Buyer BEWARE of the RUDE cashier SYLVIA, extremely unpleasant, unwilling to help and always with NEGATIVE attitude. She needs customer service training....Someone please tell her to stop complaining about other customers or employees....Cashier that does window display is always kind, friendly and helpful.	0
Prices not great for true thrifters. Staff completely useless. No dressing rooms. I simply have nothing to say about this place.	0
"This is one of the true sleepers of \""neighborhood Pittsburgh.\"" Since 1979, this \""diner/family restaurant\"" has been serving excellent breakfasts and home-cooked dinners. The staff has been there as long.\n\nThey have some of the best fresh-brewed iced tea in the city. They also have my favorite pancakes. If you're looking for a cheap, low key, dependable place to go, come home at 8 o'clock one evening, sit in the window, and especially around the holiday season, I assure you that it will be one of the best \""old time\"" meals you'll ever have. \n\nI hate its name, but I love the Rusty Nail."	1
The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful, prices are reasonable, the wait staff are gems, and is often bragged about by Bellevue locals.  That said, two stars is all I can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  I've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) .  Yes, the tables are packed THAT close together.  And whatever you do, don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out.	0
I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn't return for seconds.	0
"Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I'm sad to say I was sorely disappointed. \n\nThey have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that's right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  \n\nWe were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.  And it's not that I thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, \""Meh, I've experienced better.\""  Given the plethora of choices in Bellevue, this will not be my first stop should I find myself on Lincoln Avenue for breakfast again."	0
I always see this place, and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.	0
I had one of the breakfast specials and it was fantastic. There was also a continuous flow of coffee, which is always nice. Probably just missed the church crowd so it wasn't too busy either. Definitely a good breakfast spot.	1
Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!	1
The food at Joe's Rusty nail is GREAT. As the pictures will show, the servings/portions are plentiful. The service is quick, and the staff personable. I went there for breakfast AND everyone in our group left sated!! As always I had my kid carnivores in tow, and as is their custom they laid waste to EVERYTHING edible that was put before them. While they are a TAD (and I do mean tad)  bit pricey I believe that the food is more than worth it. The clientele (what I can only believe are Bellevue regulars) are polite and inviting. My breakfast was made well, tasted great, and dressed pretty as a picture. I will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last. As I say I vote with my feet and my USD, and the staff at rusty nail can sleep well tonight knowing that my hard earned cash, will continue to flow at Joe's and my feet will continue to bring me there hopefully more often than not!!	1
This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all.  When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables.  One almost hit our child.  Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there.  The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired.  Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby.  Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush.  We will not be back.  Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card?????  Please get up with the times.	0
First time here and I wasnt impressed at all!  I should have gone to the dairy queen :-(	0
"Sometime ago,I was looking for someone to service my Grandfather clocks in my home. After extensive research,I ran across these folks. I couldn't be happier with the result of their visitation. The knowledge they possess and the professionalism with which they practice,is impeccable! ALL of my clocks are running at peak performance;they even took the time to look at my \""Black Forest\"" cuckoo clocks and passed on valuable advice as to how I should maintain them. I graciously appreciate their time,demeanor,and service! I wish no one else to service my clocks in the future! YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THESE FOLKS! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank-you so much for all that you have done to restore my precious time pieces!"	1
I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle!	1
My beer distributor of choice - and there are others located closer to me.\n\nLet's be clear, it is no frills, cases of beer stacked up, limited cases in the cooler.  Selection is ok - if I were looking for something obscure - I wouldn't count on them having it.\n\nBut they are helpful and efficient.  They have convenient hours and parking**.  Also they helped me out in a keg emergency that saved a party.  Service in a jam earns my loyalty.\n\n**Note - most of their customers have no idea how to park in said parking lot.	1
Ha! The parking lot is good, and yet nobody can ever park properly or politely! This is a good distributor that is conveniently located, well-stocked, and has friendly staff. It is a little unfortunate that the only cases that are kept in the cooler are the less exotic beers, but their selection is fairly broad, and the space is small, so I won't dwell too much on that. Overall, a decent beer shop, as long as we are shackled to the idea of the distributor here in PA.	1
In my opinion, this is the best distributor in the city. The people running it are great, the selection is very good, and the prices are competitive with almost any other place I've been to. Because I'm not too picky, I typically have been stopping right at the front to buy the discounted brew that's usually out of season. You can't beat buying a case for $12.99. I'll continue to go here for my beer needs until I leave the city.	1
Love these guys! I have a huge picnic every year for my job, and I always use Pistella for my beverages.  They're nice folks, always get the order right, and it's on time.  I've also been to the store itself many times, and they do indeed have a great selection.	1
Animal Elegance is not much on the outside but the owner was very nice & LISTENED to how I wanted my teacup poodle groomed and used the products that I requested.\nI was very happy with my services and I will return. \n My poodles groom was $50,including tip, which I think is very reasonable.	1
I had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer. My dog  was not groomed to my specifications; infact she was butchered. I went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that I wanted, as well as speaking with the woman who assured me she would be grooming my dog. The owner groomed my dog, not the woman that I spoke with and she looked nothing like my dog when I picked her up. The owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service. Do not take your dog there to be groomed!	0
"This is my go to place to get my Yorkiepoo groomed. The surrounding area looks a little \""sad\"", but let's face it, lots of areas look like that here in Pittsburgh. Inside, however, the place appears newer and well kept. My dog has gotten consistently good haircuts here and she's always in a good mood when I pick her up. That's a keeper in my books! Oh, and the cost is about $45-50, which I'd say is average for most groomers I've gone to."	1
I made it back here about two weeks ago.  I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July.  Whether or not it was an off night I do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge.  I won't becoming back anytime soon.	0
I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering.	0
"I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \""Italian frites.\""  The latter, which the menu described as \""fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\"" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!\n\nAs a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a \""nice\"" restaurant?  Classless.\n\nConclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's."	0
Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.	0
"What a disappointment!! Evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  \nWe had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what \""awhile\"" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).\n\nFood was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.\n\nService was rough.  Long waits and lack of attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.\nNot sure Pino's will get a repeat visit.  Disappointment:("	0
Bland food and poor service. Its a shame since it's a great location and could be much more, especially since there is always overflow from nearby point brugge.	0
Enjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect Pittsburgh spring night.  The charcuterie plate worked well as an appetizer for 3 and included a fantastic balsamic dressing.  I had the best pasta and white clam sauce I've ever experienced, and the other members of our party enjoyed their entrees, as well.  Nice find in the Point Breeze neighborhood.	1
this place had a great selection. The mussels were outstanding and the staff was very professional!!. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT!!!!!	1
The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.\n\nWhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there...	0
Another really good meal here!  My friend and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!  They also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!	1
"I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years, and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. I've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away, and was pretty unimpressed... The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? It claimed to be \""fresh pasta,\"" but it was completely tough and chewy (not \""al dente,\"" just undercooked), and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?"	0
Stopped in without a reservation around 7 pm. I ordered the house soup. It was very yummy. The soup was a tomato based soup with noodles and chick peas. I also tried the sausage flatbread. The flatbread sizing easily fed one. My boyfriend shared with me. The tomato sauce and peppers on it really made the flatbread. \n\nI really one to come back int the summer when the front windows are opened and enjoy some wine and small dishesa	1
Nice atmosphere with above average food. This restaurant has a lot of potential. The wait staff was far below average: They were slow, and we had to ask multiple times for things. They were not the most polite wait staff, and our waitress was either a little demeaning or very socially awkward.	0
"We were huge fans of Pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \"" we have to get to Pinos!\"" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   Sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!"	0
I live in Connecticut and visit family in Pittsburgh often. Pino's is my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. \n\nI don't have one favorite dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so good, I need to order it next time.\n\nMy brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time.\n\nOh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list.\n\nOh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!\n\nNo, it isn't cheap. But, I'm happy to pay for quality.	1
"If you don't like your food... do not send it back to the kitchen... The \""Chef\"" will come out and scream at you... Stay away from this place."	0
Great	0
Definitely overpriced for what they offered.  Took my car in to check my AC, they didn't get back to me for the whole day, and decided to fix whatever the problem was without asking me and charging me an insane about (approximately $150 more than most places).  Definitely will not go back there again.	0
I was passing through Pittsburgh and discovered a headlight was out.  I found Bastone through Yelp and drove over.  \n\nThey fixed the light on the spot charging me $12.  First impressions are great - very clean repair shop and the service for this minor repair was done in a friendly and welcoming manner.	1
Love this place, really nice people willing to help and pretty decent prices..	1
"This Giant Eagle truly is giant!  And believe me, that's about all it has going for it!  You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\n\nYou know that a trip to a large, \""one size fits all\"" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.  You know that it's pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  Its purpose is purely utilitarian.  But good gravy, you'd think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  It shouldn't take you a half-hour just to get one item.  \n\nThat's what happened to me yesterday.  I would have been better off going to Cogo's or 7-11.  I might have paid a bit more, but I would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  I prefer the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill."	0
I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It's just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce. Parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious Wine and Spirits in the same stop. I think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning.	0
"Been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. Today, left a full cart bacause a woman (with a baby in a stoller) shouted at me for \""cutting in line\"". Will never go back. At night it is a nightmare."	0
I agree with other reviews, this store is poorly laid out and honestly makes no sense. Sometimes bigger is not always better. I used to head here often while living near Shadyside to stop at the Family Dollar & hit GE in one run. \n\nI normally only stopped here for a Redbox movie. My debit card got hacked at an outdoor Redbox at a Get Go so I'll only go to a Redbox that is indoor like this one. \n\nAnyways, I'd hit up the liquor store for some wine afterwards for dealing with long lines/wait & awkward clientele outside.	0
Ugh. Dirty. Long lines. Walked out without making purchase .	0
"Figure I'd give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks.  I don't remember her name but she is one of the \""bigger\"" woman there.  I wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy.  So I asked her for a trim to get the sides/back cleaned up.  She said ok and off she goes.  5 minutes later, we were done.   Yes, just like a bad date, we were done in 5 minutes.\n\nI got home, showered, and saw the damage.  It was messy.  What's worst is every day it grows, it looked even worst.\n\nI'll just stick to my usual barber."	0
Food: There are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  We've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  The general Tso's tofu and the Moo Shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  The eggplant was soggy and not great.  The portions are large.  Nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\n\nPrice: Tasty is cheap.  \n\nDrinks: N/A\n\nAtmosphere: Typical Chinese takeout place.  A photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  Located in the plaza next to Pizza Parma.  Decent location for that end of Shadyside.\n\nService: The employees speak poor English but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  The food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\n\n(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\n\n(-): food is nothing to write home about\n\nWould I go back again? If I'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.	0
This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. Sadly, they prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. It's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. While it wasn't what I ordered, the food was good...but there is better Chinese food out there.	0
Tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold.  Will never order from here again.	0
Not Tasty At All.	0
Never received my order and was left in a bad mood. The driver did not carry GPS for delivery, did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill, did not listen to me (or did not understand me?) when I tried to give him directions, asked me to pick up food from an intersection 0.3 miles away from my apartment in snow, and finally yelled at me to cancel my order. \n\nCannot comment about food, but whatever experience I had left a bad taste.	0
Home of the Italian Army.\n\nVento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\n\nThey have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. \n\nNo debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!\n\n(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)	1
I had heard lots of good things about Vento's. Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things. The service was slow and lukewarm. The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also, no credit or debit cards here.  You're directed to the ATM in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   I ordered ahead and although I had to wait for my pizza when I got there I received it cold and it just was not that good.  I also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good.	0
We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\nIt also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!	0
Horrible Food don't waste your money\n\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\n\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \n\nI looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.	0
Oh I love this place. Their pizzas are square/rectangle! A single slice is a little pricey for the size, so if you're going to go, get a whole pie. It is in the strangest location (Home Depot's parking lot)!! The picture of the founder is adorable and hilarious. Love this place!	1
"This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. When I got to the counter, the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didn't have my ticket to ring up the order. Um, okay...then walk over and get it so i can pay for it! So I waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders. The \""workers\"" just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. I had to leave without my order after 40 minutes. DO NOT GO HERE!"	0
This is great, simple, traditional italian american food. The salads are good. The pizza is really great (I stopped ordering from anywhere else).  The veal cannelloni is awesome too.	1
This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\n\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.	0
I went to this place because I had a LivingSocial voucher. Even with this voucher I feel like I paid too much money. I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.\nThe only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM, so if you are desperately starving, not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer, this might be a tolerable food option.  Again, it is advisable to be desperately starving.	0
Mikes took my car after horrible repairs/service from Kenny Ross South.  The service was great and I even got to meet the owner who came out to personally speak with me on a busy Friday afternoon.  Great guys there.	1
I took my car to Mike's auto body as it's recommended by Geico and is part of their easy claims and repair process.  This was a big mistake.  Like many of the reviewers here, I was initially told it would take a certain amount of time, and then, at the last minute, on the day I was supposed to get my car back, they told me it would be a few more days.  Their excuse?  The headlamp that came in didn't have a bulb with it.  Seriously?  Since this was the Geico rep telling me this I couldn't really argue, but I don't know why Geico keeps working with a business that repeatedly does this to its customers.\n\nI got the car back in great condition, cleaned on the outside, and the console wiped down inside.  All in all, just alright - go here if you're not pressed for time and you've got Geico, otherwise shop around.	0
"I never grew up with a pet so getting one was a new experience. I had always heard kill/no-kill shelters whatever... I got my new dog Crosby from ARL which happens to be a \""kill shelter\"". Thinking about this, I felt truly good getting him there because I felt as though I was saving him from some other destiny. However, he is so cute that I'm sure someone else would have adopted him...\n\nThe shelter itself is large and the volunteers and vet-techs that you interact with are very friendly. The dogs are constantly walked and you can tell the animals receive a ton of love from the staff. Adoption is made easy unless you rent in which case you should probably bring a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to adopt. Another perk is that when Crosby had \""kennel cough\"" we went after hours to get him some medication and they still let us in and treated him...In short, great adoption experience at ARL."	1
I could never stop saying good things about the Animal Rescue League! As other reviewers have pointed out, going there both breaks and warms your heart.  I adopted my puppy, Brock, back in January, and I couldn't be happier.  The staff was super helpful and very kind. They gave us enough time to make sure Brock was the right dog for us, and also made sure we knew what we were getting ourselves into. (Brock is a husky mix, so he's a ball full of energy. Great running buddy! :) ) \nI will most definitely be back and plan on telling all friends considering a pet to adopt from the ARL!	1
Staff members here have always come up short. A past kennel worker  sold his litter of pit bull puppies in east liberty and the shelter was made aware of it  but excused it. \n\nThey will lie to surrendering families because they don't  want the cold hard truth, the good, bad and the ugly to leak out to the public. They lie ! \nThey kill many many animals because of a very subjective behavioral test that their dog hating staff performs .\n\nThey kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter.\n\nMany volunteers walk on eggshells here because they know an animals life is hanging in the balance and they are afraid to speak up or not allowed back in to volunteer . \n\nWeak leadership. This is the cities highest cat and dog death rate of any shelter or rescue in western pa	0
"This is a terrible shelter.  It appears that they routinely turn away (or kill, unless you state you will take them back) cats because they are \""overcrowded.\""  They will tell you that your cat has a \"" behavioral issue\"" to address turning said animal away. Mark that you will take your cat (or dog, etc.) back or else you risk having them \""put down.\"""	0
I just adopted my second dog from this shelter, I think they're wonderful! You must keep in mind that no rescue shelter is going to look like a 5 Star hotel and be able to keep every animal free from illness, but the ARL does a great job. All pets are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and receive a microchip. Your first vet visit after your adoption is half-off their already cheap prices at their in-house vet clinic. They also give you a little goodie bag along with the pets vet records.  I'm so thankful for the furry friends I've adopted from the ARL!	1
Vincent has done several hems and jacket alterations on men suits for me. Items have always been one time and done well. I would recommend this place to anyone searching for a tailor in Pittsburgh. \n\nIt does seem a little expensive, but worth it, because its done correctly.	1
It was 1:00 pm on Friday and i was in a serious bind... I needed new suit pants altered and my flight was leaving the next day at 10:00 am. I called and Vincent said he would help. He got the job done, with a smile and his work was perfection. \n\nI would recommend Vincent to anyone needing alterations. Great customer service.	1
The times I've been here, its been an OK experience. However, their store hours are absolutely terrible. Closing at 7pm basically means they're never open when I would need to go there. Despite this being more conveniently located, Walgreens and Target end up getting most of my quick-shop business, simply due to late hours at night when I need to cook, clean, realize I'm out of toothpaste, have a headache, need a last-minute birthday card or whatever.	0
This place is a disaster. I made an appointment online for 5:30PM. When I got there they refused me service, asserting they close at 6:00PM. Nevermind that online published hours are from 7AM to 7PM. Furthermore, their own system sent me a confirmation email for my 5:30PM appointment. Finally, this building is an absolute dump... Goodyear should be ashamed to have the brand attached to it.	0
Tire replacement, was told it would take about 1.5 hours (when I had an existing appointment). It's almost been 2.5 hours and I'm still waiting. Ridiculous.	0
"I experienced three main issues with this Goodyear location while purchasing/installing a new set of tires:\n\n-They did not have my name or appointment in their system when I showed up. Fortunately, they still honored my appointment. \n\n-They did not install tires correctly. Left for a business trip the following day, and once I got on the highway and my speed passed 65 mph, the car began to rattle (with my new \""comfort tread\"" tires). Booked an appointment, and they fixed the issue.\n\n-Two months later, I went to my Toyota dealership for routine maintenace. The dealer mechanic found that the lugnuts on the tires had been over torqued by Goodyear. So the Toyota mechanic had to saw them off of each tire and replace them with non-security locked nuts. (If I had a flat on the side of the road, I would have been SOL).\n\nAll of these issues were entirely preventable. The lack of expertise and techincal skill at this Goodyear location is abysmal. I do not recommend."	0
I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires.  My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said OK.  Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.  Last time I ever set foot in that place.	0
Poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own. When asked to repair something, Rockwel Realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requests\n\nWhen asked to clean mildew, they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them. When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew. \n\nThe entire building also has severe electrical problems that causes all lights to be replaced twice a month. No permanent fixes are made to existing units, but there is constant construction to expand an old building so they can collect more rent.	0
Exceptionally poor maintenance service. They refused to start heat before mid-October and the centrally heated apartment grew very chilly as Fall progressed. On another occasion, they refused to change a rusted and weak lock. The lock eventually gave way and I locked myself into the bathroom. After the incident, I requested that the lock be changed immediately, and one of the owners threatened saying that we were in default of our lease agreement for not keeping our apartment as clean as when it had been leased to us. Dealing with Rocco and Elisabeth is nice, but good luck getting anything done with Nick who seems to be increasingly handling the operations of Rockwel.	0
I'm a lawyer in NY and I'm visiting a friend in Pittsburgh. I am blown away by the code violations in this unit. The tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail. I am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in PA.	0
This place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. It offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. Still ha that neighborhood feel though. I have never had food there though they offer paninis. Great desserts. Good espressos and okay coffee.Outdoor seating. Good place to study. Plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless.	1
Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.\n\nIt is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.\n\nEnrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.\n\nOther reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).\n\n- free wifi\n- outside tables\n- tasty treats\n- they have a blog!\n- really great coffee\n- the staff are coffee experts	1
Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\n\nThe coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\n\nIn addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.\n\nAll that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.	1
One of my favorite coffee places in Pittsburgh. THey also have pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are looking for some light lunch food. Otherwise, they have plenty of pasteries/cookies to eat that are pretty good.	1
Some of the best coffee I've ever had.  Ever.\n\nStick with an Italian Cappuccino and bring a good friend for some good conversation.	1
Quick service, amazing coffee, nice vibe.	1
Good coffee!! The atmosphere is nice, it was good to get out of the cold when we took our walk :)\n\nThe coffee was good, and not too expensive.	1
Outstanding lattes. Period. \n\nThe service can be *very* slow, but the latte is worth the wait. And, the staff does not seem to care to chat with customers, but they make darn good lattes so who cares.\n\nTucked in the beautiful Highland Park neighborhood among many historic houses and close to the handful Bryant street restaurants, Tazza D'oro is a fantastic place for coffee lovers like me. A nice short walk from Highland Park is a welcome plus. Get the latte, take a stroll down the street to explore the houses, and take a walk in the park. That is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you. \n\nThey also have food, but I cannot speak for that. The interior is somewhat run down at places, but that gives it character.	1
Finally, a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee. The espresso is incredible, which makes for an excellent cappuccino, and the food is pretty good, too. Croissants, muffins, and other baked goods top the breakfast list, while made-to-order paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menu.\n\nThe crowd at Enrico's is varied, which I really enjoy. My 65-year-old neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks, college students, techies, and other folks who are looking for a good brew.\n\nNo frills, no extras; just nice people in a quaint coffee shop, brewing up warm goodness.	1
"It was a bit out of the way of where we were staying, but I was swayed by the Yelp reviews!  You did not steer me wrong. \n\nA nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood, Enrico's was the perfect spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed.  My wife and I both got lattes and pastries, and everything was good to go.\n\nIt looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair.  We got the next to last free table.  Almost every \""two-top\"" had only one person sitting at it.  I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes. \n\nRecommend!\n\nP.s. I thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here."	1
What a great find! I frequent the nearby Bryant street restaurants, but did not even know this place existed until a friend of mine brought took me here today for hot chocolate. I immediately fell in love it. The baristas were very friendly and my hot chocolate was great! There were also some incredibly delicious-looking pastries which I will need to go back soon to try. There was a nice ambience - it was quiet but not uncomfortable so. It would be a great place to study, read, or visit with friends.\n\nYou should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink, but it is well worth it :-)	1
BEST COFFEE IN PITTSBURGH!\n\nYou might think there is better coffee elsewhere.  You're wrong!\n\nI love this coffee shop, and there is a second location the Gates Building at CMU that I like to go to--their panini are to die for.\n\nI love this place, and you will too!	1
Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe, but this place is certainly competitive. French Press, Drip, espresso, or pour over? You name it they've got it. Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. If it is just coffee you want you this is the place. It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh.	1
This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!	1
Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.	1
I've heard a bunch of good things about this place, so I decided to make a trip over there on a Sunday to check it out. While I enjoyed the coffee and cookies I bought, I have to say that everything seems to be a bit overpriced and I did get a feeling of snobbery from some of the staff. However, the venue was actually nice with a nice neighborhood feel. Every time I have been there since it has been really crowded and I've had trouble finding a seat. I would love to go back in the summer and sit outside at one of the tables.	1
I love Tazza D'oro! It is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.\n\nIt it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.\n\nI usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.\n\nI'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip.	1
The coffee was ok, but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. The place was dirty, with straw wrappers etc on the floor. The light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. There were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  I got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. It was ok, but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout, I would not go back.	0
I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down.	1
"This is not a review on this gym. It is a review on their customer/membership service. I just called there. All I wanted to know is what their monthly fees were. Simple right? Wrong. They want your name and phone number and the rights to your first born child and then they won't even tell you anything without you physically coming to them to \""talk\"" about what's best for you. I took psychology classes, I know what they are trying to do by talking to you face to face. I am sorry, but I want a gym, not a drug dealer. I don't need you to try to shove your products down my throat, I want to go somewhere to work out and be left alone. (That's why I wear headphones and don't make eye contact). \n\nI just wish places like this would give you a straight answer about their membership fees without hassling you. I won't go here now, period, because I don't believe in these kind of tactics. Just be straight with people, is that so hard?"	0
I'm a gym guy. I go 3 or 4 times a week among other workouts and activities. \n\nPros\nAlways towels\nVery clean\nAlways cardio equipment open\nPools/hot tub\nLots of lockers\nFriendly staff\nLots of classes\nLots of free wights\nNext to target and trader joes\nEven during peek hours it's never over crowded\n\nCons\nWhen the old lady's come in they take up all the parking spots some how. But that's not the gyms fault\nOnly one flat bench press\nSince they have pools and a kids activities some times kids wonder into the wight areas\n\nSo in the end more pros then cons.\nThis is more just nit picking but as all gyms have them. There are a few weirdos who are members and just take up space more then workout but oh well what can ya do about it.	1
The food here is okay.  Wings, BBQ, Bar foods. The floor here is always super slippery.  It doesn't matter if I am wearing heels or sneakers.  I just don't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink.	0
Living down the street of Buffalo Blues has it's advantages and disadvantages.  The huge beer selection means there is something for everyone.  For any game there is always a crowd and you can have a good time eating the wings, which are decently priced and good.\n\nThe bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors.  It's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game.  But, while they have a good number of HD TVs, only two are broadcast in HD so don't think you'll be getting a great picture.	1
In the last week I've been here twice, partially because I don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.\n\nI tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than Sharp Edge's. The sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. To wash it down I had Loose Cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!\n\nOur waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care.\n\nThe beer was pricy - Tuesday night I had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...	1
The front serves as a good Pittsburgh sports bar. It's a particularly great place to watch the Penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. There are lots of HDTV's and there is a good selection of beer. \n\nThe food, however, is bland and is terrible bbq, even for the northeast. I would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.	0
I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK.  I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.  I actually liked the wing sauces I tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic).  Our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive.  \n\nI would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was OK.\n\nSurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.  A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.	0
Great Pittsburgh Happy Hour! $5 dollar apps and dollar off tap beers.\n\nThey have a wide selection of draft beers, so if you like to enjoy flavors other than Miller Light this is a great place to go and enjoy some IPAs at a good price.\n\nWide selection of $5 apps too. We ordered the BBQ Nachos, and they were amazzzing with multiple z's! I crave them all the time now.\n\nGreat service too. Our server was happy and excited to be there. She made the atmosphere more fun.\n\nGet there :)	1
I've heard about this place, I've seen this place, and I've wanted to try this place. Finally, yesterday my company took us their for lunch and I did not leave disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is not a restaurant that is redefining the culinary scene in the city, but it is a tasty place to enjoy your traditional burger, fries, and drink.\n\nThe atmosphere is total sports bar, but it is not overwhelmingly so. The staff was nice and for being in a party of 14, the server handled us well.\n\nThe food was great! I got the Salsa Burger subbed with a turkey burger and it was delicious. The burger was plump and large, full of flavor and cooked perfectly. I recommend this burger! It also had salsa and guac on top with some cheddar cheese and my mouth is still watering for it. Tip? Get the sweet potato fries!	1
Food: 2 stars. It's really not very good. Especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. Blue cheese wasn't bad though. My wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. Nice and fresh though. \n\nDrinks: 3 stars, for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.\n\nService: 3 stars. Could have been better, could have been worse. Friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (Hint: if one person calls you over for a drink, make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) \n\nAtmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. \n\n1 Bonus star for accommodating the Pittsburgh area Buffalo Bills fans! GO BILLS!!!	1
Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be good. Something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad. Since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable.\n\nWriting this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game. The beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is. I essentially live across the street so I know I'll go back, but I hope some of these poor reviews will help them turn things around in the kitchen.	0
Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY.	0
Pass on this place, there are better restaurants mere feet away.\n\nThe menu here is too large, which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good.  And, its not good.  Some of the salads are alright, but its just not good food.\n\nThe service is friendly and prompt, but the beer is over priced.  They do have a good selection though.\n\nThis place is open late if you need a bite to eat, but there are so much better options out there.	0
Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service!	0
Loved the hot vegetarian sandwich. Not easy to find veggie dishes which don't feel like a compromise. This was great. Excellent service from waitress Ariella with the long black pony tail (don't know her last name). Nice casual atmosphere. Resonable prices.	1
I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  \n\nI love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  \n\nHowever, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.	0
To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all.	0
Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back.	0
"Watched a bartender serve a guy a beer when he was visibly intoxicated. He was swaying in circles on the chair next to me. I told the manager about it and he told me \""that guy is just crazy, I've seen him much worse\"" so I guess that makes it ok. Made this paying customer leave after one beer."	0
Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar.	0
China Garden appears to be your run of the mill Chinese take out place (standard menu, decor, etc) , but I was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was.  We had both the cashew chicken and seafood delight, and both were awesome.  Also worth noting they are super fast (food was ready within 10 minutes).  I'd easily say this is the best Chinese takeout place I've found since I've been in Pittsburgh (about a year).  Highly recommend it.	1
"The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \""krab\"", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup."	0
This is my 2nd time here and I thought that I attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact I was sooooo hungry. Well my 2nd time and for a Chinese Buffet, this place is fantastic. The restaurant itself is very clean. The buffet is also very clean and even though I showed up within an hour of closing, they were still bringing out fresh entrees. The amount of choice is less than just about all the Chinese Buffets that I have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. All the patrons here are American, so this isn't the Asian place where the Asians eat. It's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. I would certainly return. Giving it 7.5 Knuckles out of 11.	1
This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap American food. The food was a little too greasy even by American Chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after I left that place. To me, that's a no-go signal.\n\nOn the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there.	0
I have a cat, so this review is cat-centric.\n\nGreat independently owned pet store.  They only carry more premium foods, so if you feed your cat Fancy Feast or Cat Chow, don't come here for that sort of thing.  Also only carry the more eco-friendly cat litters - no Tidy Cats here!  Friendly staff, and the prices are not much more than you would be paying at Petco or similar places.  Of course, you don't get the huge selection either, but this is my go to place for buying food, litter, and random toys.\n\nIt makes me feel good to be supporting a local establishment.  Try it - you might find that you like it too.	1
That is a great cat they have working, but they only have 3 brands of cat food, all of them expensive.  Funny enough though not as expensive as what I was looking for.  They followed me around like I was going to stuff my pockets and that just ruined the whole mom and pop thing.	0
Dr. Eric Segal was a complete ass. He was rude and obnoxious to me and my wife. We went to him for an adjustment and I left wanting to adjust this idiot's face. I will deter all of my clients from going here and will personally make sure that this man doesn't disrespect anyone else like he did to us.	0
"I had to get new tires mounted and balanced and when I went to pay, the guy at the register actually says something to the effect of \""Do you have any idea what this is supposed to cost? So, I could charge you $400 and you wouldn't know the difference?\"" Joking or not, why even go there?"	0
Made an appointment for 3:30. They completely forgot I was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour. Came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot. They said it would take another two hours to start work. Completely unhelpful and unapologetic.	0
The new manager, Ray, was really friendly and helpful. Had to diagnose something with my car-done quickly. I usually go to the Monroe in Wexford, this one is just as great! Thank you!	1
"I came in here to have a diagnosis done on my car because the ABS light was on. \nThey removed all the tires, showed me how the sensor and ABS work, did not perform the diagnosis I originally went in for and told me that I should have the back wheel hubs replaced for a total of $1,222, this with a new set of breaks (that I knew about) and \""without\"" charging me labor. \nI may not know much about cars but I know how to search the internet and ask for advice. I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor). \n\nI also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage. You should always have your car washed, specially in the winter. It may save you $100's.\n\nThis place will rob you blind.\n\nNever have work done in a place like this until you do your homework!"	0
"Ah Monro, where \""45 minutes\"" is actually 2 hours and running at the time of this post. My car is on a lift with no tires and the employees are smoking cigarettes laughing. I can't even escape if I wanted to. At least they turned the heat off in the waiting room. Not like it's November in Pittsburgh or anything..."	0
I wish we had a way to hold this corporation accountable for its crimes against our society.	0
"Please go to the other McDonalds (not too far from here at 120 Penn Cir W).\n\nOne time while using their drive-thru service, we realized they forgot to add an item on our receipt. We asked how much the real total is and the employee told me, \""like $5.00.\"" WHAT!?!!?!!  CAN YOU PLEASE USE YOUR REGISTER TO TELL ME HOW MUCH THE ACTUAL TOTAL IS!"	0
"Prepare to be wowed. \n\nHigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \""Gar\u00e7on\"" I asked, \""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence."	0
I don't expect much from fast food restaurants. But I do expect to be spoken to when I am a paying customer. I just went through the drive-thru at this location and, other than taking my order at the speaker, no one said a word to me. There was a different person at each window, and neither of them said hello, your total is, fuck you, nothing. I don't think I've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people. \n\nMaybe they're upset because their heroin operation was shut down.	0
Walter's is just a fantastic establishment.  Tim is a phenomenal mechanic, who is as honest as they come, charges amazingly low prices, and - Morten H. is not lying - will actually suggest ways to save you money.  The shop is small and usually pretty busy, but they will do their best to fit you in and get your car fixed up ASAP, and Tim always takes time to explain your car's problems to you.  He will even show you what's wrong inside the car, or tell you how to do something yourself if that's what would be more sensible.  I recommend Walter's to anyone who's in the market for a mechanic.	1
I cannot say enough good things about Walter's.  Tim, the head mechanic (Tim Walter, hence the name of the shop), is amazingly helpful and accommodating.  He repairs my car quickly every time I go in, and I never have to bring it back for further repairs.  He also fits me in right away (though it is a good idea to call ahead - they do get super busy because of their sheer awesomeness and small size).  And when I pick my car up, he'll explain what was wrong and how he fixed it in a completely unpatronizing way, then usually undercharge me.  I know, sounds too good to be true, but isn't.  I'll be moving for grad school soon, and I can honestly say I will miss Walter's.  I don't think I'll ever find a better shop/mechanic.  \nA quick word of warning: Tim's adorable, but completely ADD.  He'll fix your car well, and quickly, but he does get easily distracted sometimes.  Bear with it, he's totally worth it.	1
"I went to Walt's due to the reviews I saw here on Yelp.  I like supporting local business and I also wanted to find a garage I could trust.  There was nothing wrong with my car I just needed the oil changed and I asked them to make sure I was \""good to go\"" for the winter season.  They changed the oil, check my tires and topped off all my fluids all for $36.  Tim is a helpful guy and will take his time to explain things to you.  They seem to be quite busy all the time which I see as a good thing.  However, it does mean that you have to call ahead for an appointment and you may not get your car in on the same day.   I will be going back for all my car care needs!"	1
Tim is fantastic with German cars, including my 2003 3-series BMW, which was out the door for 400 - broken axle, oil change, tire rotation and one other thing. Labor prices are reasonable, it's just hard as hell to get an appointment. If he weren't so damn nice (like doing all sorts of free things for people) he could probably have himself a bigger, better garage and more people working for him.	1
As numerous people have pointed out, Walter's is indeed a great repair shop.  Tim (Walter is his last name) and the rest of his staff are friendly, honest, professional, and reliable.  I highly recommend this shop for repairs, maintenance, and check ups.  \n\nHowever, they are victims of their own awesomeness.  The waits here can be long--2 weeks or more--due to how busy they are and they only have one bay.  If you do have a pressing safety concern though, Tim is always willing to take your car for a spin or do a quick diagnosis to let you know if something needs to be taken care of.	1
Walter's garage is awesome!  I was in real trouble with my car and needed immediate repairs and he managed to fit me into his busy schedule and charged a fair price for the work.  He was kind and honest--what more could you ask for from a mechanic?  :)	1
"I have a general rule of thumb when picking out an auto repair shop:\n\nThe \""office\"" must be very messy and grease and dirt must be everywhere.  \n\nIn my opinion, if an auto shop has the time and money to keep a squeaky clean appearance, they're wasting some of your money you pay for service.  Walter's Automotive fits the bill with their \""office\"" being a small cluttered desk in the service bay.  Their \""lobby\"" is the doorway that you stand in just outside the \""office.\""  I couldn't be happier with my first impressions--to me, minimal overhead means maximum service and value.\n\nSure enough everyone at Walter's is very nice and helpful.  Apparently, everyone else in Pittsburgh knows this since I have to schedule an appointment 10 days in advance just to get my car inspected.  So please, even though Walter's is awesome, don't come here--I want this place to myself."	1
I was having an issue with the emissions light in my car. I spoke with Arlene, who gave me a rundown of what I could expect while my car was in the shop. She then told me that even though they were very busy, I could stop by before my appointment so that Tim could check things out and make sure my car was safe to drive. Tim poked around, figured out it was the gas cap, and sent me on my way without charging. A good mechanic is worth their weight in gold and I will not only return to this garage but refer others as well.	1
"Another five-star review, this one from a newbie.  The brakes on my Honda fit were making a frightful sound.  I was sure I'd get the full-rotor press from the chains, because that's kind of their job.  The dealer sold me the car in the first place, so I don't like them. (Not 100% happy with the Fit).  A little research turned up Walter's 42 5-star reviews, so I thought I'll give them a try.  I wasn't certain they'd be able to see me soon enough, but whatever.  Walter called me back within 1/2 hour, told me to get the car in ASAP to make sure it was safe to drive, 'and then if you have to go somewhere and wait, you have to go somewhere and wait.\""  I delivered my car 1/2 hour after that, went somewhere and waited, and had it back, fixed, within another hour, for less than 200 bucks. Walter's garage from now on. Yep."	1
I had to give Walter's 5 stars, if there was a way to say it was exceptional, I would do that.\n\nI found Walter's through yelp and was not sure how a auto repair shop had all 5-star reviews. This is totally unheard of. And now having gone there for a repair and inspection, I can just say, BEST MECHANIC IN TOWN. Other people have sung praises for Walter's already, so I won't get into that. My recommendation: If you are looking for an amazing, trustworthy, competent and humble mechanic, dial Walter's number. You will not be disappointed.	1
Went to Walt's Auto for an inspection after seeing all of these great reviews on Yelp, and was so happy I did. I will be taking my car and my husband's truck here from now on. The service here cannot be beat!	1
Walter's is the best and most honest mechanic I've ever worked with. They are super busy because they are so great, so they have no need to do unnecessary repairs. Can't speak highly enough of quality of their work and integrity!	1
Finding a decent, honest auto mechanic is always a battle. I can't stress enough how amazing Walter and his team are. They are very friendly, personable, honest hard working people. I would never go to another garage in Pittsburgh. I can't stress it enough!	1
The Kelly Strayhorn is a good idea which is poorly executed.  The facility has problems:  the stairs on the house are too narrow causing trips, the bathrooms don't really have the capacity for over 300 patrons, etc.\n\nBeyond the facility you get to the actual 'poorly executed' idea.  The staff is extremely un-knowledgeable about the subjects they are producing.  For instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts, they are all visual arts people playing at another field.  As a result they don't even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell.  \n\nThe sad part about this is they REALLY try.  They throw staff and new ideas at every opportunity.  Don't expect great performances here, expect a talked up mediocre performance.  \n\nAudience follows content and they don't have content or the staff that is knowledgeable enough to know better.  Check back in in a couple of years.  This apple is too green to eat much less pay for.	0
I am at Food Glorious Food every weekend. I always try to sample something new every time I go, and everything I've had has been wonderful.\nThe cupcakes are so buttery and the fillings and frosting so creamy (and sweet, but not over the top sweet). The fruit tarts are also excellent-- my favorite is just topped with a very generous amount of cream and and assorted fruit (berries, kiwi, mandarin orange, etc). Ahh, soooo good.\nI haven't tried the focaccia (yet) but they look incredible. And I ALWAYS get a biscuit. Every time.\nThey recently expanded their hours, and are now open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And they will take orders by phone. So if there is something you want that is a popular item, you can call and they will hold it for you until you get there! \nThe line can be long but the staff is very efficient-- I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place!	1
I arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 5pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery (except for the staff). My pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright. I also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake. The key lime cake was definitely the best of the three.\n\nWhile I've been to better bakeries, I will definitely be back. I have heard stories of wonder and delight from other friends.\n\nThere is a small seating area with tables and a water dispenser for diners.	0
This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. It's a bit edgier than most of the others bars in the area, which also gives it a lot more character. This place is one of the closest things that reminds me of an urban-artsy feel that I'm used to in Southern CA. \n\nShadow supports local artists and has weekly open mics. Only downside is I'm not used to paying a cover for open-mic sessions, but I understand an establishment needs to raise some dough. The drinks are decent and there are many local and big artists that come here for shows. \n\nAlways good vibes at Shadow!	1
Among the best of the 'burgh.  Great live acts on a regular basis.	1
Combinacion!\nThis place is the shit for real.\nWhere's the Patron at???\n\n(b)	1
One of the most eclectic venues in Pittsburgh. Shadow Lounge has a great variety of acts that it pulls in.\n\nI just went to their Titletown Soul & Funk Party and it was a really great time. Great music, fun crowd, pretty decent prices on drinks. I'll definitely be going back for Titletown and in general, Shadow Lounge is a great place to see alternative acts in Pittsburgh.	1
AVA/ Shadow Lounge is a place that I would take my out of town guest on a Monday night.  With the live music and well mixed drinks, it is a place that is sure to be a good time. \n\nIf you're luck to nab a seat/table near the door I would recommend it.  Since the live music can be loud, it's a great way to enjoy the band and still carry a conversation.  Definitely stop by and check it out- you won't be sorry!	1
Enjoyed the winter solstice concert Saturday night. Fun scene, cover benefited charity, drinks were decent (nothing spectacular), but the grilled cheeses moved this review from a three to four star rating. Fun night, cool spot. Will go back!	1
There were zero other people here aside from my friend and I.	0
i was here for a concert the other night. apparently, there's much more to the venue than the side we were on where the stage was, but it was a pretty small area for a pretty big crowd. ok, so we arrived shortly before the opening act and ordered beers. $4 for a yuengling bottle isn't ideal, but whatever. we snagged a table with stools near the door before too many people got there. by the time the opener was over, the place was packed shoulder to shoulder, and whether we stood or remained on our stools, it was nearly impossible to see the stage.\ni liked that it was an intimate venue, but that many people packed into such a small space, with expensive drinks, and not even a good view? not the best venue i've ever been to...	0
"I agree with Stacey B. I am not cool enough for this place. I Spoke with Jay Malls briefly, and he was indeed cool ,This is one of the best R&B DJ's since Venus Flytrap. (from \""WKRP in Cincinnati\"" )\n\nI hope to stop in again soon . It is worth the trip."	1
Fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things.  I mean I know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine, but all the other stuff...meh.\n\nI've only really gone in here to pick up paint, so I'll focus on that.  I feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter.  Each time I'm in there she always seems to be by herself with a line of customers all wanting there base paint tinted.  I don't believe there was ever a time I could just walk up to the counter and have my paint mixed for me.  Give that woman a hand.	0
I would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business. \n\nEmployees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. Strike that... I'm certain they notice, they just don't care.\n\nI'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. There are plenty of HD's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)!	0
Waiting 20 minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a Friday afternoon.  Priceless!	0
Fairly mediocre, even by the relatively modest standards of Home Depot. Unfortunately, this is probably the best you're going to do for hardware in most of Pittsburgh.	0
Tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency.  fail.	0
Went here with my girlfriends last Saturday.  They were having a girls night event.  A small bar & desserts were included in the price.  It was $40 per person. We loved it!  We worked closely with a glass artist.  We didn't just watch, we were acutally doing it!  We made glass flowers, I can't wait to pick mine up!  (It takes a few days.)  I definitely recommend this as something different to do with friends or on a date! My one friend did a glass blowing event there & said that this was much more HANDS ON than the glass blowing was.	1
Great for a quick cut.  $22 for extreme attention to detail and excellent finish.	1
This place is outstanding. I always get great discounts, and all the mechanics are very honest and helpful. I am certainly not rich and Marvin is always willing to assist me with my budget and what needs to be done on my vehicle. I've been given very specific directions on whatever needs to be worked on, taken back to the garage and allowed to see the old/new parts with no hassle. I would definitely recommend going here.	1
This is the greasiest pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh, I couldn't eat it.	0
Provolone sticks arrived undercooked, cheese was fully solid, they tasted okay. The pizza also arrived undercooked, the dough itself was partially uncooked in the middle. I had to put it back into my own oven to finish it off, and then it was greasy and just okay.	0
Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \n\nMaybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone.	0
"Ahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 PM, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. I got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. The pizza was decent. There was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\nOne irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \""we don't have those anymore\"" or \""no, we can't cook wings dry.\"" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated."	0
This was one of first pizza places that I've tried inPittsburgh. It was about 5 years ago. I don't have a clear memory of that time but I have Parma pizza phobia ever since... So go figure...	0
I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.\n\nI figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  \n\nI have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!'\n\nI'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.\n\nI'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.	0
Good food	1
When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place.	0
I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.\n\nHere?  Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.\n\nSecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\n\nThirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \n\nThere are a few good points, though.  The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot.	0
Whole paycheck is a fitting name.\n\nThis Whole Foods is decent for regular items but their prepared food prices have gotten really high as of late.  \n\nI used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for less.\n\nWhole Foods had it's day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products. \n\nNow it's just more expensive.	0
I always used to avoid Whole Foods because I thought it was way more expensive than Giant Eagle or Trader Joe's.  I recently moved to a new apartment and made a quick run to Whole Foods to stock up on groceries.  It's now the closest grocery store to me, so I figured, why not just this once?\n\nThere was tons of interesting looking stuff, and I found myself getting carried away and filling up my cart way more than I had intended.  I braced myself for the total in the checkout line and was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't much more than I typically spend at Giant Eagle.  On top of that, the produce stayed fresh for way longer than GE's typically does!  From now on I'm going to stick with WF for all my fresh produce needs (along with a few other specialty items -- some of their frozen Indian food is surprisingly good), but I'll still go to GE for my everyday grocery shopping.\n\nSure, their parking lot is a madhouse, but so is the Market District's.	1
Compared to other Whole Foods locations, this one is tiny! For comparison, the Whole Foods in Las Vegas must be at least three times the size. Still, it's nice to have and it is pretty decent overall albeit pricey.	1
Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.  Waste of time AND money overall.	0
Food poisoning a la Tomato Bisque Soup.\n\nForever skeptical.\n\nThat's too bad, I don't mind paying extra for better produce or better brands. But, I KIND OF mind getting extremely sick, so sick that anything I ever would vouch for goes down the toilet, with my vomit.	0
Great selection of vegan, vegetarian, raw milk, prepared foods, bakery, cheeses and aged beef. Very expensive, trader Joe's and Market district come to mind as a cheaper alternative. Parking at this particular store is a nightmare.	0
"I find it really easy to save money at Whole Foods. Did you know that you can stack a Whole Foods coupon with a manufacturer's coupon? If you google \""Whole Foods deals,\"" you'll find a whole slew of couponing blogs that tell you where to find the coupons. Most are available online too, so no worrying if you can find the coupon section from last month's Sunday paper.\n\nI don't find their prices that outrageous compared to other stores in the area for the things I shop for. The 365 brand is a good value and oh, do I love the bulk bins.\n\nThis store barely compares to the Whole Foods in other cities, but its a start! I don't get here as often as I like since I'm in the South Hills. However, when I do go, I try to get here before 10 a.m. on a weekend to avoid the parking lot craziness."	1
everything is a cluster.  the store.  the parking lot.  the people -- customers included.  full-on cluster. barely any parking for a massive, heavily polluting pick up truck.\n\ninside: avocados are the price of gold, and there are no goddamn vegan taco spices at a place that's supposed to be so fancy.  \n\nmeh.  go to market district where they keep it real.  real classy!!!	0
Yes I am a fan and yes I am Shadyside yuppie. Judge me if you want. \nI love everything about WF and it is my go-to grocery store. I try not to give my business to GE. WF's hot bar has fed me many many dinners, in exchange for money of course. However, that is what I call money well spent. I agree with the other reviewers that the parking lot can be a little crazy, but I live around here, and it's the norm. I am just glad that there is a huge double decker parking lot. Also, you can always park farther away and not have to deal with the mess. It's good for health! The produce is fresh and for regular grocery you have a wide variety of healthy choices. The cherry on top is that the staff is always friendly, super helpful and happy!	1
"the parking lot @ this wholefoods is an ABOMINATION!  to compound the issue, whole foods allows their purveyors to park on centre ave (a road that is already miserable enough to drive on) and block traffic. this past monday, a shearer potato chip truck was blocking the right lane. doesn't whole foods have a loading dock? i wrote an email to the district president and he had one of his store minions respond: \""you can park @ walgreens\"". sorry, i am shopping @ wholefoods NOT walgreens. translation: whole foods developers were TOO CHEAP to buy the proper amount of real estate. dont even bother coming here fri-sun unless you like a clusterF*** lot full of zombies. this is the 5th WF i have shopped @ (4 in florida) wholefoods should have opened in the south hills. the demographics out there would support it. this wholefoods is BUSH LEAGUE!"	0
I am a big fan of the Whole Foods company in general.  The store back home (Omaha) had a wine bar, espresso bar, gelato, sushi and udon stand, a GIANT cheese counter where you could sample...I could go on.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Whole Foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  Two-thirds of the time they are out of what I came for.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying THAT much for groceries, I want a stellar shopping experience.  This WF is mediocre at best.	0
This review is for the buffet at Whole Foods. Overall, it is good, and there are lots of great options. The food seems fresh and it is a good place to get a quick, healthy lunch on-the-go. I went with a friend and we spent a little over $20 on lunch for the 2 of us, which seems a little high for what it is, but I think we must have just gotten a lot of food because $7.99/lb is fair. Plus it is hard to get lunch for any less than that these days without eating fast food.	1
I'll be honest, I just don't get it.  When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc.  If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it.\n\nFrom that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.  So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium.\n\nTheir prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven.  But that's about the only two sections I probably would have been willing to open up my wallet.	0
Now with two new bee hives along the rail line as of July 2012 managed by burgh bees of Pittsburgh	1
I loved it, parking and all, after all, they had Palak Paneer! Mmmmm. It was tasty. I spent a lot, but I was ok with the occasional splurge. the second trip, i again bought my hit foods Palak Paneer and it had obviously gone over. \n\nEver have whoopsies after green Indian cuisine?\n\nIt's off my list now. Forever.	0
"I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium \""natural\"" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link!"	0
I don't shop at Whole Foods that often since it isn't that close to me. There's a Shop n Save a block from my house, so I buy most of my food there.\n\nOne thing about Whole Foods is they specialize in fresh fruits and vegetables.  Their produce is definitely impressive. All of the oranges, lettuce, berries and bananas peppers are perfectly ripe.  They never have spoiled or bad fruit.\n\nThe pastry section is definitely worth checking out.  They have fruit tarts and a lot of different flavored cheesecakes and cannolis.\n\nWhole Foods seems more expensive than Aldi but less expensive than Giant Eagle.	1
"As a vegan (since 2008) we are a regular at whole foods. It's convenient since we live in Lawrenceville. My one and biggest complaint is that they need to carry more (if not all) organic produce. Not this \""conventional\"" garbage. Other than that they have a huge variety of products and grocery items to choose from. Staff is always friendly and helpful."	1
I love going here, if you shop smart it really isn't your whole paycheck and is less expensive than other options in the area (Market District I'm looking at you). I only buy the store brand unless I need something special for a recipe, and my bill is consistently less than anything I bought at Market District. The quality of the produce and the meat cannot be matched anywhere in the city, unless you go down to the Strip. But hands down my favorite thing about going here are the employees. If you read anything about the corporate structure or culture of Whole Foods you'll understand why everyone seems so happy to be working. I have never had a request met with anything less than a smile, and I love that they are willing to let you try a new product before committing to the whole purchase.	1
"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Awful! My car wouldn't start so I called the tow and he managed to get it started, but it's been acting up so I brought it in anyways. After having my car for an entire week and not calling me once, after I've called twice, the man on the phone told me it was ready to pick up, nothing wrong with it. When I went to pick it up, I turned it on and before I could even leave the lot, it died! I went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it. That's what he did. Then told me it probably didn't start because it was sitting so long. Then he told me \""I don't know anything about your car\""! I left and sure enough had trouble getting it started at my next destination, had to pump the gas pedal. Yeah, that sounds like \""nothing's wrong\"". DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE. THEY ADMITTEDLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CARS!"	0
I'm torn!  If I could give it 4.5 stars instead of 5.0 I would, but I can't quite do 5 because I've been to other Pittsburgh facilities that have better court facilities and my own home courts out West didn't get a 5, so I can't be accused of bias, haha.\n\nPITC is just that, the Pittsburgh indoor tennis club.  It is conveniently (for Shadyside and surrounding areas) located in the East Liberty area, very close to Target, PetSmart, and Pizza Sola.\n\nThere's five courts, four full courts and one singles-only court.  They play faster than average with a low bounce unless you're a heavy top-spin hitter.  They're definitely kept in good condition and for an indoor facility that seems to be older in age the lighting is quite good.\n\nI did their two hour clinic on Sunday afternoon after playing a USTA match there and I can definitely say it is a great great great value.  You get an excellent workout and the teacher during the clinic actually gives your pointers and provides remarks on your game.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to trying out more of their clinics in the future.	1
This club is now officially closed for good due to redevelopment in the area.	0
You can see their second bar through the front windows.  I always assumed that that was their first bar, and just walked by the place maybe a hundred times, until walking in and noticing that everyone was drinking in a different bar.\n\nIn other words, this place is *huge* inside.  The place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; I like the decor, even if it might be slightly dated.  \n\nChinese and Korean food, at or above my expectations.  The stuff on the menu is good, and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely.  Kung pao tofu is my favorite so far.	1
Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\n\nHot & Sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\nWonton Soup was a very large portion and good.\n\nEgg Rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\nCheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\nChinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\nFlaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\n\nTea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\n\nThe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average.	0
I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  I'm writing this review after going there twice.  The first time my husband and I went, the dinner was good.  We thought this place has the potential to be our go-to Chinese restaurant in Pgh.  Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  \n\nWhat really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  The smell wouldn't leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as I could) to get rid of the smell.  Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  \n\n[first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]	0
Hey, Jimmy! Cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! The early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke.\nI had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). I'm going to avoid this place until I get a craving to drink tobacco.	0
Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected.	0
Best chiropractic center I been to others Dr Novak and staff are the best in the Pittsburgh area they are concerned and problems always taken care of excellent adjustments  I always feel better after I leave there	1
As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant.	1
"I went to Casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. They use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. I had the house made granola which was just amazing! Toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (\""the rest\"" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)\n\nMy only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait. Anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now I'll know to make time the next time I go. Which is for dinner for a friends birthday. So excited!!"	1
Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\n\nService was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.	1
"Another great big burrito restaurant, Casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.\n\nThe three dinning rooms, \""outside,\"" inside and downstairs.  While downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.\n\nThe food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.  If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it."	1
I was pleased to finally find a place in Pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. I tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal better myself. Not here.\n\nThe food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was delicious--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty! \n\nDecor is subtle and great for a date. Service was friendly and accommodating.  I will most definitely return!	1
There is a disconnect here between this name, the decor and the food. That said, I had the best pork chop I've ever had here and for that I was endlessly thankful. Good salad, delicious bread and hummus. Great service. For Pittsburgh, top notch.	1
Excellent place for brunch.  For $22, I had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  Service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  Reservations available through Open Table.  This is definitely a special occasion brunch, but it is surprisingly affordable.	1
Went here on father's day with my best friend and it was oddly not crowded at 11:30am on a Sunday. Anyway, we got the Brunch prix fixed meal with mimosas! Yum. We sat outside and it was just a nice cool environment with the overhang of plants and vines. \n\nFor my 2 courses I got the cinnamon polenta which is basically like oatmeal but much more creamier. IT was honestly, amazing. I loved it. It came with some almonds and some cranberries, but the polenta itself was great. I would come back just to have that for breakfast. For the main dish i got a crab omelette. It came with fresh fruit and potato fingerlings. The potatoes were great and the omelette was ok. Not the best I have had, but any place with crab in an omelette should get credit.\n\nIt was a great brunch and i was stuffed by the end. This place was courteous and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We had a great time here and it's just a nice place to relax.	1
Another one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  The best things about Casbah are it's very cool atmosphere, good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).\n\nI had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).\n\nThe atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe).	1
I ate here for brunch on Sunday.  It's $22 and you may have to roll yourself out after.  It included a mimosa/bloody mary, appetizer, and main plate.  I had the fruit and cheese along with the brioche french toast.  All was great.  They could have had some more flavorful cheeses, but the atmosphere and kind service made up for the lackluster cheese.  The bacon and potato fingerlings were absolutely amazing!  I will definitely be returning for brunch!	1
great atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.\n\ncasbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy.	1
Disappointing. \n\nMy bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.\n\nWe ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.\n\nThe waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.	0
Had a very lack-luster Mother's Day brunch at Casbah yesterday. Despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m., we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. I asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. An utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but I think Casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile.	0
I came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.  Portions are decent, and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. \n\nThe outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.\n\nOverall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  If I was offered to eat this food for free, sure, I'd take a helping, but probably not seconds.	0
Of the Big Burrito group restaurants Casbah is the one that has never failed us.  Consistent and delicious with great flavors of the mediterrean.  \n\nAll of the dishes are served with great flavors from their pastas to their duck but their signature Arugula salad is a reason in and of itself to visit.  Crisp clean flavors with complex combinations of textures.\n\nSpecial occasions or hungry on a week night... casbah is a great stop	1
My fiance and I like to go to Casbah for special occasions and each time it never disappoints.  \n\nThe food is great (I highly recommend the Pork Chop and the Short Rib Ravioli), the drinks are wonderful (I am a sucker for good Sangria - and Casbah's is wonderufl) and the service is outstanding (our servers are always friendly, prompt and very knowledgeable).	1
Out of towners that happened to stumble upon this gem. Thanks, Siri. Wow! What a great experience. Fantastic, wine, food and service.	1
So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!).	1
Very expensive for a college student, but quite good.\nI would recommend this if you enjoy European food in general.	1
This place was recommended by an employee at Evolve spa across the street and I was very happy with the restaurant. The Salmon appetizer was delicious as was the gnocchi meal. I will definitely go back to this restaurant when I visit the area.	1
Food phenomenal! Service can be hit or miss.	1
1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!\n2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.\n3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!\n Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!	0
Ate lunch at Casbah for the first time. Tried the Piccolo Gusto: $15 gets you a small choice of salad, a half sandwich and a half portion of a pasta or risotto. Great deal and fantastic food. Argula salad, shodt rib sandwich and wild mishroom/truffle risotto. No need for dinner today!	1
Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very good. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. One cup of risotto for $20+? Four ravioli for the same?\n\nThey altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call.\n\nService was attentive and the setting nice.	1
Hard to remember another restaurant that hit home runs from start to finish.  Yinzes say it's pricey but I disagree, the quality is hard to find period.  Very progressive menu but not too wild, products are from near area farms, very knowledgable staff.  And butter served at the right temperature, that's a novel idea!  Just a great experience, can't wait to get back there.	1
Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!	1
It's a little pricier than most places in the area but the quality and ambiance is well worth it.    The food was really good and the drinks were relatively reasonably priced for the surroundings,  great place to take a date...or spouse.	1
Wonderful brunch and good dinner. The service obviously prides itself on being super proper (choreographed plate delivery, polite to the point of almost sappy attitude on the part of the waiters) and it can be a little bit annoying even. However, this is the probably the classiest of the Big Burrito restaurants, so if you're looking for that, this place is great. Extensive, yet expensive, wine menu. Small-ish portions and a very pleasant covered heated patio.	1
Went here for bruch and had their take on the classic eggs benedict.  I'm a huge eggs benedict fan and this was very good.  I opted for the prociuto as the meat option and I'm glad I did.  It gave the eggs enough flavor without having to add extra salt.  \n\nThe potatoes were perfectly cooked and the fruit was tasty as well.  Had the bellini and didn't realize how I much I would enjoy it so I had two!	1
- Great food. I had the Gerber's Amish Farm Chicken Breast and it was cooked perfectly and delicious =]\n- Nice wine selection. Though I'm a beer guy.\n- Friendly staff.\n- Okay atmosphere.\n\nThis place is definitely worth trying. Will be back for seconds!	1
My husband and I went to Casbah on our first date night after having our son. Our plan was to take our time and indulge in everything. After we looked through both the wine selection (outstanding) and the menu (delicious), we decided to do things a little differently. Instead of ordering just two entrees, we wanted to sample as many libations and treats as possible.\n\nFirst, we ordered the white wine flight, and split a few seafood appetizers; then, we ordered the red wine flight, and split a few meaty appetizers; and, finally, we each ordered a glass of our favorite red and split a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce dessert. \n\nOur bill was quite pricey, but I feel totally worth it. Every single thing we drank and ate was delicate, perfect, satisfying, and well balanced. I would go back and spend the money any time!	1
Good food, great service, but high prices.\n\nMy date and I shared 2 appetizers, a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings. Bill was $115 without tax--pricey by my standards for this experience. The new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. The bruschetta with fig and grape butter, prosciutto and blue cheese was good, so was the beet salad.\n\nWe were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.\n\nMake sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.\n\nAlthough I would come here again, there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. I would rank Casbah below Eleven within the Big Burrito group of restaurants.	0
Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!	0
A delicious menu with a twist. Unique wine list too!	1
Though Casbah has been around for ages this was our first time dining there. In short, the restaurant itself was nice and the food interesting though a little on the pricey side. Service started out great but for some reason our entrees took forever and our waiter more or less abandoned us. If I'm spending a $150 on dinner for 2 I expect some sort of explanation on why we are having to wait 45 minutes plus between our appetizer and the entrees. At a minimum, I don't want to have to flag down the server to order another drink and for god's sake don't make me ask for a refill of my water.  If I was only basing my decision on food I'd probably go back but all things considered there are too many other restaurants in Pittsburgh where I can get amazing food AND an amazing dining experience.	0
I've been to this restaurant with my husband twice, once for dinner before I moved to Pittsburgh, and once for brunch a few months ago, and both were great meals. When I went for dinner they accidentally threw away my doggy-bag instead of giving it to me, but they offered to make me a new order, so it worked out fine. When we went for brunch it was quite crowded and we had to wait a while before getting seats at the bar. The food is really fantastic though and there are good vegetarian options. It's pricey, but worth it if you're celebrating a special occasion. Seems like it would be perfect if you're looking for a romantic place to impress a date.	1
This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.	1
I am so happy they got rid of those awful bar stools!!!   We often choose not to walk in to Casbah without a reservation because the bar area was historically uncomfortable.  They have traded out the old stools that were screwed in to the floor, too far from your companions, and didn't comfortably turn to face people (who thought that was a good idea?) in for some admittedly less attractive but functional chairs,  I'm a big fan of the lunch and dinner there--we'll add that more often to our walk-in list now,	1
Lovely, relaxing atmosphere. The cauliflower soup with tarragon emulsion was fabulous, as was the tomato basil soup. The waiter was attentive and happily allowed for a substitution on my salad so I could try one of the raw milk cheeses from their cheese sampler. The grilled chicken breast on my salad was a bit more dry and hard than I like, but I am not a big fan of barbecuing chicken and it certainly seemed to have been charred that way. If the chicken had been moist, this place would get all five stars from me!	1
A taste of CA in PA.  \n\nWe walked in and I would swear I was in Santa Monica or Hermosa  beach.  Great atmosphere- creative menu and delicious food.  The steak was to die for and the pumpkin cheesecake finished it off.  \n\nThey also have a nice wine list.  The French Chardonnay was quite good!\n\nThanks for making me feel at home.	1
My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place.	1
Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. Yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available. We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water, were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order.  \nM	0
Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.\n\nGood service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.\n\nWhile the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.\n\nAs with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!	1
I've eaten at Casbah four times since my first review - from cocktails and an appetizer to lunch, everything has exceeded my expectations and the service has been great every time: polite, helpful recommendations, and my glass is never empty. I continue to think that the Piccola Gusta lunch menu is a real value and has some really delicious options, but I would have dinner just to try those little candies they offer at the end of meal at dinnertime again - they are a cross between maple sugar and caramel, so good they're worth a star all by themselves.	1
We love this Big Burrito establishment as it matures and becomes a perennial choice to enjoy, no matter the season. It starts with a well-stocked bar area, nicely lit and very comfortable. The indoor dining area is complimented by the (now-covered) outdoor seating area. \nService was mostly attentive, and very friendly throughout the evening. The wine list is varied and reasonably prices, with especially fine after dinner selections. \nWe started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. \nI also had my all-time favorite salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach. \nDessert was a nice assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit). \nValet parking is complimentary; please tip your driver!	1
Had dinner tonight at the bar.  My sister and I wore sweatpants and flip flops... Nobody treated us differently .. The brought out bread with butter and a second butter made from goat milk.. I liked it .. My sister said it reminded her of cream cheese.. We shared the calamari ... It was good... I had the halibut... It was good accompanied with a salad.. My sister had the duck.. I didn't like the duck that much but I am not a big fan of duck to begin with .. We each had wine ... I had the falanghina .. It was perfect.. We shared a bread pudding for dessert.. It was the first time I ever had bread pudding... It like it .. It is a nice quiet restaurant with ample seating both inside and outside...	1
I recommend the short rib ravioli! Totally the best thing I've had in a long time.	1
This used to be my all time favorite restaurant for dinner in Pittsburgh. The food is always top notch - lunch, dinner and brunch. \n\nI think for brunch they offer one of the best bloody Mary's in the city, with just the right amount of kick! My favorite dinner entree was the casericcia - not sure if I spelled it correctly. Why did they ever remove it from the menu is anyone's guess. It was amazing. I went there for my birthday dinner and was ready to order it when the waiter explained that they removed it from the menu despite it being one of their most popular dishes. What a total let down. Nothing compares to it in my book. That's the only reason I'm giving Casbah a 4 star review... \n\nPlease please please bring it back!!	1
Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?	0
It's good when they are on, but they are so inconsistent you never know what you are going to get.  The coffee machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in the last century which is off putting.  Generally, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are in the neighborhood and desperately hungry--you MIGHT catch a lucky break and be there on a good day.	0
Fun, unique atmosphere (hippie / indy / hipster / whatever these kids are calling it these days). Interesting, tasty food. Above all, awesome retro decor. A Pittsburgh treasure.	1
A cool (if mildly painfully hipster-ish) decor; perfect settingfora Sunday brunch. The service was great, the food was both satisfying and healthy, and the milkshake I had to top off my omelet was deeeeelicious. Are all of their milkshakes vegan? Because ifthey are, I was completely fooled. A little more than I was hoping to pay for a breakfast dish but I suppose I can't complain, as it was morethan enough to hold me through until dinner. (I agree with the comment I saw that stated that this would be a perfect place for a hungover posse!)	1
"I eat at this place at least once a week.  No longer cash only, which is nice since I never have any.  As a vegan I like that I have a ton of options here, but that my meat-eating boyfriend is happy too.  Food is a little pricey and if you get more than an entree and coffee it's easy to quickly rack up quite a bill for such a modest seeming place.  My only real complaint is the inconsistency of the service.  It's totally hit or miss.  I've never felt targeted with \""attitude,\"" but I have experienced long waits for the menu, coffee, water, the check - but weirdly, never the food. Most of the time I leave happy, sometimes irritated, but I'm always full and ready for a nap."	1
Maybe I am just the most jaded vegan in town; Quiet Storm's food menu bores me to tears, that which I will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home! Their coffee isn't all that great either, as given the choice, local La Prima is in my favor. Tears. This is the only vegetarian restaurant on the East side of town, and oh so close to me, but I cannot stand to go there. Desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room.	0
Very few people name the places depending on how the place is going to look like from the City's perspective.Confused??\nI bet half of Pittsburgh students didn't notice this amazing vegan place,it is like a quiet storm ;just there but not really.Now i am confused!! :)\n\n  Straight to the point -this place is huge and neat and they have a huge cafe bar with great food list.i ordered thai salad with vegan chicken and tempeh and my friends ordered wraps.It was simply delicious and i was extremely excited that i discovered this place after a long Vegan research.\n\n The place was definitely quiet and shockingly even the area around the place was dead.Maybe they have some historical reasons to name it Quiet storm like there was a light storm and everyone left the place...ahmm..I shall stop my list of lame reasons,such that you could stop reading and would be able to chase the quiet storm :)\n\n-Smriti	1
Well, I think Heidi S. pretty much covered all of the bases here. The lemon-ginger tea that I ordered was weak, perhaps not steeped hot enough? The hummus, wow, definitely the worst; tasted like paste. Yuck with a capital whY. I considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant, but since I do not plan to return, I guess methinks not.	0
"i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however, i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed.  let's start with the good things.  QS has a great atmosphere, it definitely helped the transition from austin.  very chill \""hippie\"" vibe.  however, the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch \""hippie-elitest\"".  the food was alright.  their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things.  i do love their thai dressing, very yummy on the salads.  will i continue to go back?  probably, wishful thinking is  a good thing."	0
For vegetarian food in Pgh this place is hard to beat. The quality of the food is very good, but the kitchen tends to be slow so bring a friend/book/deck of cards, and the serving sizes are somewhat inconsistent. The coffee drinks are OK, but I don't come here for those. I love the atmosphere of this place, very laid back, cozy, inviting. My favorite eats are the soups and the pile-o-hashbrowns (think haystack without the artery clogging gravy).	1
YUMMM.  Read the Yelp reviews before coming, so I knew to get the ginger lemonade and hangover hash.  Both were amazing, filling, AND i got to use the wifi there for a couple hours on a Sunday morning with no nasty looks from the staff (it was crowded but no line).  Totally worth any effort it takes to get there (seemed to be in the middle of nowhere, I had a couple mile walk to get there.)	1
We go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. It's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). My bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast  Homefries with tofu instead of eggs. The waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. This establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet, you may find yourself disappointed.\n\nOn cold wintery days try a Mexican Hot Chocolate - it will surely warm your heart!	1
I'm going to revise my review of Quiet Storm.\n\nYou may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. In my experience, however (considering the 30+ Cubanos I've eaten there), you're more likely to get a sad, mediocre rendition.\n\nConsistency is not their strong point.\n\nAdd to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude, and I've decided to steer clear.\n\nIt's a shame that I no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at Quiet Storm. It's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful, friendly, and helpful, and yet their efforts are overshadowed.\n\nSorry, Quiet Storm. As a Pittsburgh vegetarian, I want to love you. But you broke my heart.	0
"The menu looks awesome and the dish concepts are good except everything that comes out is disappointingly bland. Thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table. The best part of the meal was the peanut butter chocolate milk shake. The burger and \""spicy\"" Cajun soup were very mediocre."	0
I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone, the service is awful. It's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it.	0
"Why do vegetarian restaurants think we need \""fake\"" meat, this I do not understand.  I had a primavera sandwich which was just ok, but the patty on the roll was just as perplexing as the \""mystery meat\"" you get in your elementary school cafeteria. My sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag.  Otherwise the atmosphere was fun, and the wifi was free if you ask for the password."	0
Yes, it is reasonably priced.  Yes, my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10).  However, the place did not look clean to me--I won't be back because of that.	0
Tasty horchata - dessert before the meal of veggie Cuban with smoked tempeh ... Yum!\nCool funky space with low key music & friendly waitresses with plenty of tats	1
We've figured out where all the hipsters go on the weekend for brunch!\n\nReally excellent french toast, just like my dad used to make. I had the breakfast burrito, which I thought was OK, but not something I would order again. But, more importantly than the food, we just really liked the atmosphere. Sitting there in their mismatched, vintage-y looking diner, I felt like I was in the Mission in SF (OK, maybe minus the fact that everyone was sporting their winter gear, which would never be necessary in CA). Kid friendly too, if that's important to you.	1
Everyone I show this place to loves it. Yes it's totally hipster and funky. Yes, hipster service isn't going to walk up to you all bubbly and smiley and be super cheesy to you. But the employees are chill, and it's all about the food, milkshakes, and coffee. The rotating menu is awesome, and I've tried a lot and never gotten anything bad. The chai milkshakes are amazing, as are all of their drinks. I'm not even a vegetarian and this one of my favorite places to go over and over!	1
So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely.\n \nWe went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok, not stupendous, not horrible. He ordered the veggie burger, and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.\n\nHis burger was unseasoned and fairly cold, my pancakes were okay...but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind). I don't discriminate, I'm all for veggies and vegan food, but just because those are your ingredients doesn't mean you can't cook things well and add seasoning.\n\nI am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had.  \n\nI will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly, but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that it's really deterred us from going back.	0
I decided to grab dinner on a Saturday night at Quiet Storm. It wasn't packed so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered their Graham Street Tofu sandwich with their 'chorizo' soup and a shampoo soda. The Graham Street Tofu sandwich and soup were very good but the shampoo soda was interesting to say the least and wouldn't order it again. I was nervous I wouldn't get good service after reading some of the reviews but the waiter was friendly and checked in at the right times. I would definitely come back to Quiet Storm since they've got me curious about their other dishes. I also like the laid back vibe of the place, bringing me back to Forrest Gump time.	1
"Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. I can't even believe that the server, let alone the  \""chef\"" thought it appropriate to serve. \n\nBrought my 2 year old along, had to get a high chair, I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one."	0
I had about half a day to kill in Pittsburgh, and this is where I ended up. Traveling with food restrictions for any reason can be quite difficult these days, and Quiet Storm was a sanctuary for me to just sit down and have an awesome, vegan meal without worry of going into anaphylaxis.\n\nI had a bowl of something-something with I think tahini sauce and veggies and a huge thing of hot tea (I had laryngitis and was just very, very sick so I can't recall much other than how good my food and tea was), and my fiancee had a sandwich that came with some chips and really, really, really good salsa!\n\nThe restaurant is just down the street from the Children's Hospital and I'm just really glad my fiancee found this place so I could eat safely without worry.	1
I've been introduced to their kale offerings and must admit, I'm a huge fan. There's a kale salad that you can ask them to put in a wrap and it's absolutely phenomenal. Almost all of their veg options are fantastic.\nThe downside of QS is their Sunday brunch. I know, I know most brunches are breakfast foods only, and this place is no exception. On a personal level, I don't really care for breakfast food for lunch and since you have no other choices, it's not my thing. \nLike I said though, this place is fantastic for veg food, so give it a try.	1
I've found the service here to be pretty terrible. Servers can be pretty careless about taking care of simple things and my friends have had similar experiences. The food is really pretty good, but if the overall service sucks, then well, it makes it hard to enjoy a tasty meal. Sorry Storm, you need to improve this.	0
Great cafe for brunch and coffee. Lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere. Come check out the place if you're in the area and would like to try some healthy foods. Was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. If you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu.	1
It's cheap, I'll say that, but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. There are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from.	0
"Andrew here said it best: \""...  food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily.\""\n\nIt took me 40 minutes to get a sandwich here, and when I complained I didn't get an apology, just a snarky remark \""well you can see we have a small kitchen\"""	0
The best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Pittsburgh is also my neighborhood watering hole--I'm so fortunate. The food is great (especially love the ginger sunflower dish and spicy peanut wrap) though newcomers may think otherwise. You have to appreciate what they can do without meat or other animal products. The drinks are amazing.\n\nThe hipster atmosphere reminds me of Portlandia. Staff is friendly. Gets busy at brunch time on the weekends.\n\nQuiet Storm gets 4 for its food, 5 for cool factor, and 5 overall.	1
I was vegan for years, vegetarian for about 9 years or so. This is a good place for those of us who are trying to eat mainly vegetarian (i.e. me now), or strict vegetarians / vegans. I like it here, but the service isn't always great. I've had a negative encounter with the manager / owner before...it was years ago so hopefully her customer service skills have grown since then.Other than that, the food has never been bad, and normally the servers are chill and nice. Don't expect to get your food on the fly.	1
Delicious!! Not a vegetarian, but this place might convince me to switch over. Had a few breakfast options and was blown away by the Greek plate and the QTF. Excellent coffee too.	1
Great pizza! \n\nI practically lived there when I lived in Shadyside. My favorite pizza is the Shadyside special. They also offer gyros, wings, salads, calzones, wedgies, hoagies, pastas, traditional, white and gourmet pizzas. \n\nPizza Perfectta is part of a chain of pizza shops that include Cafe Milano, Pizza Milano and Pizza Mineo's	1
I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  \n\nOne thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.\n\nThe pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:\nFiori's\nPizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)\nPizza Perfectta\nAiello's (Murray Street)\nBeto's\n\nSave for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.\n\nPizza Perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place.	1
In all fairness, I went to this place after stuffing myself at Vincent's Pizza Park.  Still, I know a good pizza when I see one, and this place is totally passable, but great or even good it is not.  My friend and I were given our pizza in a box although we were planning on eating on the premises.  Still, it seemed like we were not wanted and decided not to press the point.  We walked across the street to a parking lot and saw a Pizza Perfecttta box and some leftover pizza littered on the ground.  In the end we didn't finish our pizza and assumed that many people in the past have been hastily handed their pizza, pushed out the door, only to walk across the street, eat mediocre pizza, and decide it wasn't even worth the energy to pick it up and throw it away.	0
"Ew. Okay, not the worst pizza ever, but it's pretty far down my list of pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across the street from it. This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, \""Excitingly flavored!\"" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them. Two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when I moved into my apartment and hadn't unpacked my kitchen stuff yet. Without them I may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta.\n\nOh, and here's a little Italian lesson for you: it's \""perfetta,\"" not \""perfectta.\"""	0
Well since I stop here on my way home from work every Friday I have to give it 5 stars.  Some of my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  The cheese blend is really good.  Firm, not too greasy, and the sauce is really well balanced.  But how about the crust?  Really nice texture.  Perfect chewiness.  I would recommend Perfectta to anyone!	1
DO NOT ORDER THE HOT WINGS!! If you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste, then by all means these are the wings for you. If not, stay away. My boyfriend and i each ate one and couldn't even finish the rest of our dinner. Don't waste your money!	0
There aren't many places in Pittsburgh where you can get an above average large cheese pizza for $9. They also have a traditional pizza place menu with salads, hoagies, breadsticks, pastas, and munchies. The cheesesticks are great when you're craving something cheesy and salty, and their grilled chicken salad with fries and ranch dressing is dependable as well. \n\nOne great thing about this place is that you can stop in and grab a slice or two if you're in a hurry. This place is right along my way home from the bus from work, so I'm always tempted to stop here.\n\nIf you're looking for a great place to grab an inexpensive pizza, check out Pizza Perfectta!	1
Friends, if you are going to Pittsburgh and don't stop by Pizza Perfectta, you are missing out on service and food combined that is must have. I have the privilege of knowing the owner and his family well, and I can thoroughly endorse his professionalism and product satisfaction. An exceptional pizza delivery spot you will be grateful to attend. Excellent variety, hearty taste, and pleasurable service. And they have the awards to back it up, winning last years Best Pizza in Pittsburgh Award for 2012 from a reputable area magazine. \n\nIn conclusion, GO!	1
Got the rancho and the Greek, not so bad but I probably won't go back... Too heavy for me...	0
I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. \n\nThe people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall, i wouldn't go back.	0
Don't be fooled by the humble exterior:  their food is delicious!\n\nBetter than Pizza Sola.\n\nIts my favorite pie in Shadyside, and their hoagies and gyros are also delicious.	1
"They have inaccurate hours posted. I tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed. When I told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said \""oh that's ok....\"" And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from them again, which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items, they post accurate hours, and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?"	0
I was a bit disappointed with the pizza I got. I ordered the Milano special pizza, which had pepperoni, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc, and the popcorn chicken. The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent, the crust was not crispy at all, the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again.	0
These guys are great. We took our more mature, distinguished hound  for a check up and meds for worms and they were so kind and gentle. They truly love animals here and are willing to work with you if you have payment issues as well. They always seem to have an opening on the same day when I call, which is a huge plus! Dr Simard is really awesome and not afraid to be covered in slobber which is a way of life for any Basset owner. Dr Gerson is really great also- funny guy (kind of gruff, but kind if you look beyond that). An overall wonderful practice run by professionals!	1
The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. She was rushed, seemed distracted, and was abrupt. She very quickly said that it seemed like SCC, or oral cancer, and that there was no cure and the prognosis wasn't good. She left the room seconds after and only came back in to say that they would get blood work and schedule a biopsy. After she said she thought it was SCC, she didn't give us a chance to ask questions or respond. \n\nThe technician didn't have any demeanor with our cat, nor with us as clients. She seemed tired, and overworked.\n\nAll in all, this was a negative experience. I recommend that you take your pets to another vet :(	0
I took my two cats to Dr. Mathias for annual physicals and minor maladies for nearly 10 years. (In fact, I got one of my cats from Barbara, who was the receptionist at the time.) She set the standard of what I expect from veterinary care, and the office was managed by true professionals. \n\nThe cats responded really well to Dr. Mathias' caring nature, and I appreciated it, too. She always spent enough time with us to answer my questions and provide advice on daily or post-operative care.\n\nWe didn't do as well with Dr. Gerson, but I know that others, particularly dog parents, really appreciate his expertise.\n\nWe were really disappointed to leave this place behind when we moved away from Pittsburgh. They are top-notch.	1
This is a great little neighborhood market with a terrific friendly atmosphere. There's a large deli menu and very fresh tasty coffee, in addition to your standard one-of-everything-else lining the shelves. Its proximity to Frick Park makes it an excellent place to stop for sandwiches and provisions for a picnic. There are also a couple of tables and chairs lining the sidewalk outside in case you want to stick around. If you get really into the market, or the Point Breeze neighborhood, you can even buy a commemorative t-shirt to remember it all.	1
Frick Park Market's extensive selection of Boar's Head meats and cheeses, Breadworks baked goods, and homemade soups makes it a solid choice for a simple, inexpensive lunch.  Prosciutto and capicola with lettuce, tomato, and banana peppers is a personal favorite.	1
Used to live two blocks away and now I miss having it so close! Great sandwiches, and would always get my weekly bag of coffee and milk. The owners are friendly and helpful.	1
On our way back from DC to Chicago yesterday, we stopped off here since my friend swore by it. One of the best co-ops I have ever been to. They have such a huge selection of products. If you are looking for vegan cheese, this place has a humongous selection including Sheese, which my bud says is really hard to find. They carry my beloved Temptations soy ice cream even in chocolate chip cookie dough. Nummers! I grabbed delicious produce, a spinach and feta & olives-zaatar pie made by Najat's Cuisine, a STILL WARM ginger cookie made there, a raspberry ginger beer, and I'm sure I am forgetting something. I would come here all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. Their hot food looked good, but I wanted something to grab and go.\n\nFunny thing, in the time that we were there, three people commented that they really liked my tattoos. Then the cashier said he liked my Obama button. I love this place!	1
Spices, spices, spices! Best deal in town when you run out of something and don't want to pay $7 for another bottle of parsley at Giant Eagle. I also appreciate the affordable selection of local milk products, eggs, bread (Allegro Hearth, yum!) , and honey. One gripe - salad mix, it's 4.99 a bag! You can get the same salad mix at TJ's for 1.99, 2.99 if you want organic. And currently most of the produce is shipped from other states/countries. I don't know if that will change as summer rolls but more local would be great.	1
Just moved here from Baltimore and ran across this place.  Love it!  Watch yourself at the hot bar.  There's no scale (should be).  Your mea l(of veggies, tofu and kale) could end up costing $20 easily.  I usually grab a hot meal and play on my computer 1-2 hours.  Love the carrott juice with ginger YUM!  A small is $4.30 ouch!  Just found out they won't charge you for bags if you bring your own....COOL!	1
"Ooooppss...update time.   Got the regular (steamed spinach and lasagna) from the hot bar on my way to work.   So, I'm on my dinner break sitting, chatting it up with a co worker while eating.  I see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth.  WTF is that!  OMG, it looks like one of those fat ass worms we'd  pluck from the greens in my grandma's garden.  I threw the fork down and my co worker says...\"" you're seeing stuff.\""  Um NOT!  I sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm.  Thirty minutes later  SHAZAM...found it. Ugh, my coworker spread open the spinach leaf.  EEEkkkk, it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out.  FUCK!  Call the manager at Co-op and he says...\""Bring it in for a refund, thanks for being so nice about it...We usually just see worms in the fruits.\""  Geez, thanks for that lil tidbit.    This happened last week around the Sept 14, 2010.  Guess that means it's really organic, huh?"	0
I'm so glad we have the Food Co-Op in Pittsburgh. Although still fairly expensive, it's less than Whole Foods, and I don't do all my shopping here, just the things I have a hard time finding elsewhere. The bulk selection is one of the best I've ever seen, and I truly appreciate the salad bar on busy days. Their choices are more on the crunchy/hippie side than the high-end gourmet side of things, and it's nice to shop for vegetables without having to turn something down because it's not organic...most of the produce is. The staff is helpful and friendly, and, if someone doesn't know an answer to a question, which can happen with a volunteer, he or she will find out for you. On member 10% discount days it can get very busy, so go early or late.	1
"My first trip to the east end food co op was sort of a disappointment,  I guess I heard so much about it that I sort of made it bigger (in my mind) than it was.\n\nFirst, it's not bad, for what it is. I like trader Joe's better, I like whole foods better, but this place had stuff I use that the other don't.\n\nNice produce section, items seemed fresh, and plentiful. Mostly organic, and I do like how they label things \""local\"" so that we can help our local farmers, and growers. \n\nGreat juice bar, salad bar, and hot lunch items. Everything looked appetizing.\n\nGreat spice and herb section, I bought some freshly ground ginger and some wonderful sweet and smoked paprikas. \n\nGood vegan section, tofurkey brands and lightlife products. Good dairy section too, their prices for soy milk is a bit outrageous.\n\nThat said, the east end food co op is a good place to shop for the pantry."	1
Love the East End Food Co op .  Reasonably priced organic selections.  The smoothie/juice bar is outstanding.  Great vegan/and or healthy selections at the hot and cold salad bar.  My most favorite thing here is the ability to purchase raw, unpasteurized unhomogenized milk.   \n\nThe staff is very friendly, the. produce is very fresh.  This is definitely a good way to avoid the over priced, over processed major grocery chain food selection.  I love the co op.	1
The co-op is great!  When we had to put our children on a diet free of gluten and dairy, we were lost -- until we found the East End Food Co-op. That was 10 years ago and I've shopped there weekly ever since. It provides for all of our gluten-free, dairy-free needs - and even allows the opportunity to purchase in bulk as a member. I also love buying grains, beans, etc. from the bulk bins, fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals, nut butters, snacks, etc. They now stock meat/poultry from local farms and specialize in Vegan options. Also, have to mention the awesome produce section, stocked mostly from local farms.	1
This is a great place to buy re-purposed old windows, office furniture, old industrial sinks, old wood, door knobs, electrical stuff and more for construction projects. Found a matching IKEA office cabinet with one I had for only $20. It was originally $450 and IKEA no longer made it so it was a great find!	1
i'm all for recycling / re-using/sustainability but a lot of the items in here are just ... junk / ugly crap that no one with any real aesthetic taste would want in their home.\nprobably better for sourcing fixtures for industrial / commercial spaces ...	1
I love this place. If you have a project that is on a budget or if you just want to go somewhere to get inspired to start a project than this is the place for you. They have everything here including the kitchen sink.	1
I love this place.  I've come here for the odd bits and bobs--brass casters for a piece of antique furniture (25 cents each), vintage milk glass door knobs ($30), wardrobes for a closet-less room ($40 each), a set of four wooden chairs ($10 each), etc.  If you buy something larger, they will hold it for a small fee and then the crew will load it into your truck for you.   If you're into old houses, reserve at least 30 minutes to get through the whole store and you won't be disappointed.	1
If I had to describe it in two words: DIY Heaven. Does an acronym count as one word? I'm going to say it does.\n\nWe had a place somewhat like this in my hometown, but it was not nearly as massive or as interesting as Construction Junction. So many antique door knobs and chandeliers, windows, cabinets, toilets, tubs! Things ripped off/out of old houses, spare vending machines, cafeteria benches, even a pulpit. And everything was so reasonable! I found at least a dozen things that I really wanted that were priced under $50. \n\nShopping here really makes me wish I owned a pick-up truck. If I did I would haul away windows, chairs, mantlepieces, desks, and file cabinets in mass quantities. Then wonder where all this crap is gonna go in our tiny apartment...	1
"As a DIY'er - this place is a sanctuary. I've been here quite a few times during the weekends .. if not to buy .. just to browse around. This place is huge and you can pretty much find anything. If you can't find something you're looking for - you can simply ask one of the CJ personnel making rounds to make sure you've found what you're looking for.\n\nI was looking for a bi fold door few weeks ago and found exactly what I was looking for less than $15. - you can find doors as low as $5 and I'm not talking dirty stained or broken door. Besides used goods - there are few new \""recycled\"" items including plastic corrugated roof panels and paints for super low prices.\n\nAlso, if you're remodeling your house and need to throw those old materials - they have a number of recycle bin where you can simply drop it off."	1
A great place all around whether you are looking to donate or buy something.   If you are looking for an old door, tile or quirky part for a home project this is the place to go.  I recently bought a new vanity and was able to donate the cabinet portion (do check the website for specific requirements on donations). They make it easy as you back your car up to the large warehouse doors and a helpful worker will unload. Don't forget your receipt for tax time!  I  live 4 blocks away and often go to drop off recycling another great benefit of this place.  They have large bins for many different recycling options from card board boxes to plastic. \n\nAlso  this place is nonprofit and they have an amazing fundraiser every year in September called the Big Pour.  $75 ticket gets you all the beer and food you could want for 3 hours.  Best event in Pittsburgh!	1
This complex is chock full of all things sportsy...gymnastics, fencing, biking, and yeah, rock climbing!!  It's nothing high tech and the first climb is $12 regardless of whether you're a student or a lady on ladies night (I was both).  This hike in price is so some guy can explain some basic rules to you for 3 minutes...what a deal.  Regardless, the rates are really reasonable (although I've never been to a rock gym before so I could be way off).  \n\nI climbed in the free fall area without ropes.  Climbing courses are marked by colored tape on the walls so you can climb according to your skill level.  It's a great work out...I can barely move my arms enough to type out this review.	1
The blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us. First time we went she refused yo.get off the phone on a personal call to help us. Then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone. Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, and more expensive. Definitely not worth it. Worst customer service I've seen in a while.	0
I love the Climbing Wall.  There are tons of routes which change fairly regularly in both the bouldering and top roping areas.  There's also a wide variety of difficulty levels in the gym ranging from ones everyone can do to those much more challenging.  Bouldering routes are labeled from VB and V0 (easiest) all the way up to the insanely difficult V7 and V8, while the top roping routes are labeled from Easy to Hard.\n \nPricing is reasonable, especially on Wednesdays, which is ladies night--$6 to climb (after your first visit).  Other days the price is $12 or $10 for students/military plus the cost of equipment rentals.  If you plan on going at least once a week (or more often like me) buying a membership is the way to go, and there are different specials each month.\n\nSometimes the gym can get crowded (especially on Wednesdays) but there's lots of routes and it's fun to take some time and meet other climbers.	1
Went to this place on a Groupon and fell in love. It reminds me of the days when I lived in Denver. I miss it! The routes are decently hard and allow me to push myself to get better. Staff has always been awesome. People there help give pointers. It does get pretty crowded sometimes, especially on Friday nights. I'd say they are almost in need of an expansion! Keep up the good work, Climbing Wall. I'll be seeing you a lot for the next year :)	1
As a new climber I found the whole process intimidating, but the staff at The Climbing Wall helped me get on the right path. Also, the regulars here seemed very nice and always willing to help out a newbie. It isn't very expensive either, 10 or 12 bucks for a full day of bouldering is a very reasonable deal (I haven't seen many places which were cheaper). \n\nI'm sure a lot of people, including myself, wish this place was a little bigger, but for being in the city it's not a bad size. It's actually surprising how many routes they managed to plan out for the size of the place, there's more than enough to keep the walls feeling fresh even after many climbs. The diversity of the routes is really great too, there's plenty of routes for each skill level and climbing style. \n\nThe overall experience was wonderful: great staff, great people, and a great setup. \n\nTip: If you're a beginner without your own equipment, the shoe rental is worth the extra 3 or 4 bucks.	1
I like this place but the hours are inconvenient (top roping doesn't open until 5PM during the week!!!!) I wish they would expand their hours. Otherwise, they make a nice effort to change their routes relatively often.	1
Sub-par setting quality, infrequent wall resetting, inconsistent grading, poor climate control, poor air quality (no chalk filter), silly rule where they make everyone wear paper wristbands before entry. + 1 star because they are finally installing air conditioning.	0
I've been climbing here for 2 years. Membership is definitely worth it if you're planning on going frequently. I prefer to walk because parking is less than ideal and I live close by. The routes in the bouldering area are fun and challenging, and they're reset at a good frequency. New holds and new mats have been purchased in the past year, so a lot of the comments I'm seeing on here are outdated. \n\nThis is definitely a better gym for bouldering than top roping. The top roping area is pretty small, but they work with what they've got. I've always found the staff to be friendly and knowledgeable.	1
Worst climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump..	0
The ventilation in the bouldering area is terrible. Please install some chalk eaters. People are inhaling tons of chalk into their lungs and are going to get pneumoconiosis from climbing at your gym.	0
Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote.	0
Don't go. I got more problems and sounds on my car after I spent $800 there. unbelievable!	0
This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it.  Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem.  Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you.	0
OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  And then I didn't go for a long time.  A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\n\nI'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.  In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology.	1
My wife and I have been here a number of times and it's gotten better each time. Some tips:\n\n- stick with the appetizers. Every one we've had is fantastic. The entrees are fine, but nothing special. The apps, on the other hand, are truly first rate.\n- eat as much of their bread as your stomach will let you. Holy crap it's good!\n- It's BYO, so make sure to bring your favorite bottle of wine.\n- On a nice day, inside, but by the big window/door to the left. It let's in a nice breeze and makes the meal fantastic.\n\nTry this place, you won't regret it.	1
Lamb burger was outright bad(tasted off and charred). We shared and together only ate half. The filet was decent but not $25 worth of decent. Waiter was kind and the ambience is romantic but at the end of the day the food just wasn't that good. There are lots of great byo's in the city and in my opinion, this isn't one of them.	0
I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......ever\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option	0
I was underwhelmed with our dining experience. We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\n\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. \n\nI might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere.	0
Best Mussels!!! They were large and quite tasty.  The starter bread is corn bread and it is absolutely addicting.  My boyfriend and I had dinner on a whim on a weekday and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The setting is intimate and I enjoyed it.  I only wish we would've brought a bottle of wine since it's BYOB. The service was excellent as well. I have no complaints, even if it is CASH only I think it's worth it. \n\nNOTE: Cash only.  They do have an ATM inside for your convenience. BYOB	1
What an absolutely delightful and special dining experience!  Our family of four went there for dinner this past Friday night.  Brought along  two  bottles of wine, which is such a nice bonus. Much cheaper and we were able to bring wines that we enjoy.  The decor is lovely, very bohemian and cozy.  Just magical.  Our server was Bulgarian and very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials.  The food is Portuguese, which is primarily fish based, so we ordered accordingly. To start we ordered the cod fritters, the grilled octopus and a special salad of the night, farm grown tomatoes with Roquefort cheese.  All very delicious!  Main courses were lamb burger with caramelized onions and provolone (tremendous flavor), the impeccable seafood stew and the salmon, also lovely.  Just a perfect relaxing meal in every way.  If you live in Pittsburgh and have not been, this place is a gem. Worth checking out.  Wish we lived closer (we are DC based).	1
Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.\n\nFor appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.\n\nEntrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked.	0
The grounds are very nice here, but I have to say the part I loved best was the collection of cars. I've never seen so many antique vehicles in one place. Definitely makes it worth checking out. However. The location is a bit wacky. It's right outside of Wilkinsburg, which isn't a place to visit at all. But still, it is nice enough to check out. Especially if you want to just go have a nice lunch at the cafe.	1
I am a history fan...so when a friend told me about this I made sure he took me to go see it.  The property is very beautiful...\nWe waited a few minutes and signed in....surprising it was discount day!  The waiting area itself was exquisite and already gave rich history of the property and the people who had lived there. By the time we finished looking it over, our tour guide came in.  She was perfect...very knowledgeable and sweet.  She answered any questions we had and made us feel very welcome there.  She gave us ample time to roam around each room.  \n\nThe house is amazing and moreso the car collection.  That is free...and a must-see.  Also is you like art don't miss the art collection.	1
The art museum is pretty nice; the carriage and car museum is cool; and it's neat to walk through the greenhouse.  Those are free.  However, nothing really separates the $12 house tour from other house tours.  Like the other ones, the docents don't focus on anything interesting, like history or the architecture or the building itself.  They focus on some family story that may only be of passing interest because the family is rich.  Kind of like hearing about Paris Hilton or the Kardashians.  B-o-r-i-n-g. And what kind of tourist attraction doesn't allow pictures?	0
I popped in to the Frick because, well, why not?  I had the afternoon free and the weather was beautiful.\n\nSure, it's not MOMA, or the Met, or LACMA.  What were you expecting?  But what the main collection lacks in cachet, it makes up for with its outstanding curators.  I can't rave enough about how friendly and knowledgeable the staff are.  They went out of their way to describe the history and intricacies of each work of art.  It made even the most average of pieces come alive.\n\nThe car collection was amazing, and the staff in the outbuilding were equally helpful.  The gentleman that I spoke with went through the collection car by car, giving an enormous amount of detail and history for each vehicle.  It made what would have been an average visit fantastic.\n\nI didn't have a chance to do the tour of the mansion, but I did walk around the grounds, and they're perfect to while away some free time on a nice day.	1
I recently had semi-permanent lashes put on for my wedding at the WEXFORD Izzazu salon. Upon completion, I thought they looked a bit odd, but figured I just wasn't used to them yet. The next day was my wedding day, and my bridesmaids and I got our hair and makeup done at the downtown Izzazu salon. The makeup artist (who was great) said they looked terrible (which they did- they were uneven and there was white glue all over them) and had to remove them and reapply. They are supposed to last 2 weeks, so removing them the next morning was very unpleasant and I ended up losing a ton of my real lashes when everything was said and done. This added 1 hour+ onto my appointment and I ended up barely having any time for pictures before my wedding. I would steer clear of Izzazu for semi permanent lashes!	0
Awful facial with lulu. Used a groupon and thought it may be why she was so terribly unattentive, but realized she had no idea what I was paying with. Basically I got the 'steam machine' blowing on my face for 40 min!  \nWould give negative stars if I could.	0
I had an appointment that was made 2 months in advance and when I turned up they told me that the person I had the appointment with quit 6 weeks ago and they didn't have anyone available to take me. They made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel. To make things worse, the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude. Here's a tip, when you are in the beauty salon business, staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually BEEN to a salon. Not with rude women that have hairdos from 20 years ago. Will never go back.	0
Emailed and called several times to get a pricing on having several services done at once as a graduation present to myself. I was put on hold twice and never picked back up. Emails went unanswered.  :(\n\nI was going to have SO MUCH done, too!! Hair cut, color with highlights, spa manicure/pedicure and an hour massage! All as a graduation present to myself but if they can't be attentive to prospective customers then I can't imagine that they'd be attentive in the store. I'll spend my money elsewhere!	0

"I have lived in the area of Page's Dairy Mart for about 40 yrs. I have always enjoyed the ice cream until\"" this\"" day. I ordered an artic swirl (chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough) I have ordered this same item over and over again. When I took first taste, no chocolate chip cookie dough pieces, second taste, same thing, third taste, same thing and so on for approximately 5 or 6 tastes. I took the cup with remaining up to counter and asked them to remake, I was denied told it would waste \""their\"" money, nothing about mine, what I had ordered was more expensive than plain chocolate ice cream. They dumped what was in the medium cup into a small and handed back to me. Well it wasn't even a medium desert, since it fit into a small cup. I even tipped the girl $2 when I first received my desert. I will never return, to make any other purchases. I will however return to express my disdain to the owner when I can find him there. I hope he reads this."	0
This place is a great Ice Cream Shop. My Favorite is the birch beer float. Delicious and under $2. A blueberry shake was made with real blueberries. Really, I haven't had a bad item here. Just make sure you bring cash, that's all they take.	1
I'd rate this joint 10 million stars if I could. Best ice cream in PGH!!! They serve sundaes, milkshakes, and the old school cherry dip cones. Cool historic photos adorn the building in the back, showing how the intersection/ area looked about 100 years ago. I love Page Dairy Mart so much I want to marry it.	1
Page's has was a staple of my childhood and young adult life.  There ice cream is great and their prices are good--evident by the line that is always out to Carson St.   I wish they had a tent with seating.  It rains. . .ALOT in Pittsburgh.  Eating in your car is the signature of this place but I wish there was some covered seating.	1
The best ice cream in Pittsburgh! I've had so many different sundaes over the years. I recommend asking for vanilla with hot fudge and marshmallow sauce with graham crackers for a S'mores sundae. It is not posted in their window anymore but they will do it! \nWith the traffic from Liberty Tunnel closures rerouting past here, you should TOTALLY make a stop. It'll be the best part of your commute.	1
Whoever doesn't give Page a 5 has no soul. It's childhood everyday March-October. I love the pretzel cones, but everything is good.	1
Mmmmm. Their Egg drop soup is sooo good as is the General Tso's, and they deliver FAST!	1
Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food.:(	0
Maybe I went on a bad night, but the service was stunningly bad.  Water glasses stayed empty for almost 15 minutes!  Ordered 5 dishes, all pretty average.  The tab:  $300+.  I won't be back.	0
The food is unforgettable, but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.\n\nAsk before you order a special, or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object, this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge, with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'.	1
This restaurant was phenomenal.   We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great experience.  \n\nThe meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good.  The marinara that came with the meatball was the best I have ever had.\n\nDon't go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night, so we did not care.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  But I thought it was well worth it.\n\nThe wait staff was great.  Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun with him.  The owner/chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio.	1
I was in Pittsburgh my home town for a recent stay.  Alla Famiglia is the best restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  It was consistent with the type of upscale dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly surprised.  The area surrounding the restaurant does not seem to be the safest locale, but worth going there for a wonderful dinner.  The service was exceptional!  The food was amazing with cheese plates, bread and side for the bread basket, meatball appetizer, cowboy steak with gorgonzola, and the halibut.  The tiramisu was the best I have had.  The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem as well.  I would highly recommend this for a special night out to celebrate.  Fantastic restaurant.	1
The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out.	0
No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there.	0
Fabulous!	1
Seated in the bar after having made reservations a week in advance. That, paired with a mediocre menu and overall experience, gives this two stars. Save your money and stay in town. I would probably send you to the (gasp) Olive Garden before I referred you here.	0
Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!	1
Very good Italian. The portions are very large, so do not be tempted by the bread early. My fianc\u00e9 and I shared two appetizers and an entree. The entree also gives a huge bowl of salad and penne alla vodka. This was so much food, we couldn't even look at the dessert menu. I would absolutely recommend this place, but would suggest pacing yourself.	1
Well, the delivery was fast at least. Everything else was yucky. Avoid!	0
Best rates and deals. I now live in Arizona and still bank with dollar bank because I've been so satisfied with the offers and customer service!  Free ATM service nation wide, 1% interest on free money savings account and they give me .10 when I use my debit card.  What more could I ask for?	1
If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all. I got a fill and a fix because I broke a nail. First off they didn't cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long. Second off they are so thin I feel like they are just going to crack off.  Not to mention it seems very dirty.. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. One of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me. I will not be returning again.	0
Had chicken salad. Was good but very pricey. Their pizza is about 20-30% more expensive than any comparable pizza in the area. And since the pizza is just mediocre it is definitely not a good value so I'll pass!	0
Yesterday I had the misfortune of getting a pizza from Bishops. It was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time. Needless to say. I won't be getting one again. I got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. The pizza was bland , tasteless. Crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. The sauce was meh. Cheese was okay. Sausage was disgusting. Bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage. I don't know what this sausage was other then disgusting. I don't recommend getting a pizza from Bishops	0
The customer service is absolutely horrible. They made me wait an hour before anybody got to me, and there were 3 available beauticians in the back. I complained and got waited on right away. I thought the customer always came first. Why would they want to risk a customer not coming back. I mean I can just go down the road to Borics. These women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs. I won't be back. DISAPPOINTED...:(	0
Great service, excellent place to get breakfast at any time of the day	1
My first trip here was on a Sunday at 4pm. I was surprised to see I was the only customer. We were met by friendly staff took our choice of seat and gazed at the menu. I wanted a verity so I picked the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage or bacon.\nI ordered my eggs scrambled and sausage links. I also ordered home fries and a glass of white milk. I could smell my food cooking as I waited anxiously ( I was starving)\nMy food was ready in about 8 minutes and looked tasty.\n\nAll in all good bargain and equal food quality I'll give them 2 stars.\nLike a Pirmantis it would probably be better if I had been drinking.	0
I haven't been here in awhile, but I definitely miss it. They do hold slightly odd hours as it is a mom and pop joint and they are definitely more of a breakfast place than anything else. Their omelettes are to die for. I'm also a huge fan of their potatoes for breakfast and especially with their gravy. Yum!\nMy boyfriend is more of a burger person but he loves their burgers and fries. They have a few breakfast specials that are just as awesome\nIt is very small. And they do not take reservations to my knowledge. If you go on a Sunday morning you will def be waiting for a table.\nThey never used to accept cards but to my knowledge they recently have begun taking credit cards which is a big plus. This is definitely a mom and pop place you need to try.	1
"DiCarlos is in my opinion THE BEST pizza in the Pittsburgh area. My boyfriend and I will only order DiCarlos if we are in a pizza mood. It's different from your traditional pizza that they only cook the crust with the sauce, all the other toppings are added after it comes out of the oven. The cheese is all melty on the top and it's yum yum delicious! You have to try it. The only other pizza joint that I can think of that is anything similar is Beto's over on Banksville Road in Dormont (or Greentree, where's the line?)\n\nThis is take out only. No eating there guys. Also, there's not really a \""small\"" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint!\n\nI believe they sell calzones and a few other things, but we always go for the pizza."	1
"Maybe I just had a bad day.  This was THE WORST \""pizza\"" I've ever had.  I have had Original DiCarlo's in Wheeling, WV in several locations.  This is not even worthy of the name.  I got 3 extra cheese.  First off, the pizza was basically glued to the wax paper.  The crust was unevenly cooked.  First bite the crust was almost raw, dense, and way too chewy.  The sauce tasted sour and the cheese (shredded, not dices provolone like the Original) was slimy.  My second bite, the crust was burned, tasted burned, but at least it was crunchy.  There was no third bite.  The remaining slices got tossed in the garbage.  This was by far the worst \""pizza\"" I've ever had."	0
I am kind to all service workers! always! This place has the worst service I have ever seen. I do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. You better check your bag because they are going to forget something. Yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. He was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and Pepsi. Okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? He was told to go down the street there is a store. This is inside, not the drive thru. It seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant. I already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt. And yes I have contacted the corp. I dont want anything from them though, they can keep it.	0
The service here can be hit-or-miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. Unfortunately, when they get busy, it creates problems because they don't have a stock of anything prepared, which in turn creates delays. Their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening, leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. While I understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing, there should always be someone to watch the counter.\n\nAs a side note, their drive-thru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasn't been repaired. It creates delays at the drive-thru window for placing orders, especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits.	0
Ahh the Park House.\n\nOh so you say you are looking for a bar? Wait what's that, you would like to have a live blue grass night?..Okay Okay...hold up..you want an historic building to house it all? Well then my friends I have a place for you. \n\nGrab your shoes and wallet and make your way there. Hungry? Get a Park House burger or even a Mexican War Street burger..hell try out the hummus..it's all great. Don't let the humble sized kitchen fool you..it cranks out some great meals. \n\nGreat for those who prefer a manly dart board aka a non electric one. Terrific for those who prefer imported beer from all over. If you like free peanuts and popcorn..don't pass this place up. \n\nThe very environment the bar unintentionally spews from the walls themselves will leave you wanting to come back. Think of the show Cheers, the edginess of Ireland and the heart of folk all bended together (for 2-4 mins depending on the blender) and you my friends have the Park House.	1
After doing some drinking at some other places, we landed at Park House. Load me up with some more drinks and the free popcorn and peanuts (which you can just toss the scraps on the floor). I'm sold!! The beers were reasonably priced and this was the type of place where you can gather with friends and just hang out. No pressure at all. The lighting wasn't too dark so it felt intimate where you were sitting. Seems like a neighborhood bar where everyone knew each other. If I find myself in the area again I would head to Park House though there was the occasional creeper but I guess you can find them anywhere.	1
Went my first time for Thursday karaoke and had a blast!  They serve mediterranean fare; at least half the menu is vegetarian/easily vegan.  There are at least 2 bike racks outside, cars have decent options too.  At 10pm an improv comedy group showed... you can imagine the energy.  Super fun night, met some cool people, ate healthy food.  Oh yes, and it's no smoking!     \n\nDownside?  It's a little pricey, but the quality is there, so... you decide.	1
I have driven by this place a bunch of times and just recently realized that A:  it exists, and B: it's a bar.  I was encouraged to come here by the insistence of a friend who comes in enough that it's just a matter of time before he has his own personalized mug.  \n\nThey have a surprisingly excellent beer selection, mostly micros.  The drafts aren't cheap, at $5-$8 a draft but Happy Hour is from 6-8pm and is $2 off a draft. \n\nWe also tried the food.  While nothing to write home about, it's not bad by any means.  Decent falafel, hummus, lamb gyro...very Middle Eastern-centric.  I'm pretty sure I also ate my weight in peanuts and popcorn.\n\nI don't necessarily know that Park House will enter in my regular rotation, but I will absolutely join my friend in support of his quest for the mug.	1
I had heard a lot about their food and decided to check it out one night after purchasing a Groupon. This review is strictly for the food. It was not good. The hummus was okay, and our main plate seemed to be microwaved. \n\nThe bar ambiance seemed cool though. So if you are looking for a bar atmosphere, I'd probably rate this 3.5 stars. For dinner, not that great.	0
I went here for Bluegrass night following Banjo Night at the nearby Elks Club. What a fun night!!! It is a very fun, friendly, music-loving environment. I believe this happens every Wednesday, so definitely check it out! I will be back for sure!	1
Only groups for trivia night. Unless you're okay with meeting random people at the bar, then by all means stay. Just make sure you're watching the game primarily then pipe in when you know the answer and people next to you have absolutely no idea what the answer is.  Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and know the final bonus round question worth a lot more...\nAlso go on live music night...it's free, the music isn't the greatest, but when it's free it's at the very least a good laugh when you've got friends to chill with, watch the game - Pirates for me is always the go to. Oh and did I mention that draft Yuengling is only $2! Doesn't get much better than that on the Northside ladies and gents!\nHope you enjoy the hole in the wall as much as I did!	1
Unfortunately, I was not all that impressed with Bernie's.  It's a shame it's the only real photography store in the city, but they could definitley do better.\n\nAs part of a black and white photography class, I needed to pick up film and photo paper, among a few other things.  While Bernie's had everything I needed (and lots of other supplies) I didn't feel all that appreciated for coming in.  I spent a couple hundred bucks and felt like I was being shuffled out the door as quickly as possible.\n\nI will give the one guy at the counter some credit because a woman right before me asked to get a roll or two of film developed in just barely an hour.  I could tell he wanted to get to it quickly, but still felt like I was hassling the guy just being there.\n\nI hate to see real camera stores shut down, but unless I'm in a pinch I'm probably going to order supplies online from now on.	0
Up-charges most of their products that you can find on B&H for way less money. Sales person treated me like I was a very inexperienced. Not a bad place if you're in need of camera gear without a moments notice, but overall definitely order offline.	0
"I developed my 120 film here the other day, and they charged me an extra 4 dollars a roll for no reason.  On the website they say $8 but they charged me $12.  The owner is very pretentious and rude.  When I told him that it says 8 dollars online he didn't care at all.  When I dropped my film off the high school kid didn't even tell me the price because \""it is too much for me to calculate\""  Also, the photo equipment, darkroom equipment and film are way over priced.  I am never going back to this place.  I strongly urge everyone to never enter or deal with Bernie's Photo.  Rather, use the websites of companies like B&H, Adorama, or Calumet.  The have MUCH better customer service and better prices.  Very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city."	0
Went in to buy a cold shoe adapter in a pinch on my way to a shoot. He charged me $20 for the same exact item that sells for $6.29 at B&H. I bought it without thinking, as I was stressing on the way to a gig, but was furious when I thought about it in the car.\nUnfortunately, this is the only game in town. Makes me glad I live in New York City. You would think a store in a dying industry would thrive to provide better customer service, pretty much the only reason why I would go to a small store rather than a big one. They don't even offer that.	0
"Just stopped in to see about selling my Canon Rebel T3 to buy a 60D (that they don't have in stock because it's \""old\""). I was offered $50 for my T3, that is currently being sold online for over $300. I asked why such a low price and was told that since it was an older model it wasn't worth as much. Needless to say, I walked out with my T3. Sucks that this is the ONLY camera shop in Pittsburgh."	0
Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!\n\nMenu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too.	1
I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's.	1
Great atmosphere, wonderful service and really great food. My husband and I shared the Brat sandwich and the sampler with schnitzel Lichtenstein, sauerbraten and something with an 'l' that I can't remember the spelling of (ground loaf)....all were excellent. We had the sauerkraut and spatzle, and cabbage as sides. The bread brought out before the meal included apple butter and sweet & sour relish (cabbage) and those were excellent too. Would love the sweet & sour relish in a side size portion it is so delicious. The red dining room is nicely decorated and love the cuckoo clock that is reminiscent of my grandmother's. The beer out of the mason jar is a fun touch.  Our bill came to $29 (1 beer, 1 diet coke for our drinks) and it was a fabulous meal for so little.	1
I must of been eating at another Max's in a pararell universe!\n\nFood was terriable, service was worse! Went and got Sushi!	0
Have been  eating at Max's for 20 years.  One of the restaurants I misss the most now that I'm out of the 'Burgh.  Visit often and always stop by.  Great food and great Beer....not a bad combo.  I have dreams at night about there wurst platter and spatzele with cheese....definately a don't miss attraction	1
Visiting from San Francisco. Food was mediocre at best. Bland is the best description.  Sausages and  Weiner Schmitzel were unremarkable. Best was the sweet & sour cabbage that accompanied. But also served were over-boiled 'daily vegetable' of snap peas, asparagus, and red peppers.... to the point that they were losing their color. Good beer. Yes it has old photos of days gone by... but really there seemed no joy here now...	0
Great atmosphere of a neighborhood pub, good German beer selection, but food was less than mediocre.  Won't be back. Weisswurst was very bland.  Sauerbraten was dry and tasteless.  Spaetzle was, well, not tradidional German Spaetzle.  Schnitzel and purple cabbage  were the high points, but then again, it's hard to screw up a fried veal cutlet.	0
Nice lil bar/restaurant with awesome staff.\nMy favorite thing about this place: The staff.\nFriendly, kind and super nice.	1
I have been going to Max's for 20 years.  I love this place.  The Einlauf soup is just simple good eats, but if you're ever there when the soup special is beer cheese - ORDER IT!!.  I love their potato pancakes, sauerbraten and the basket of German rolls served with sauerkraut salad and apple butter.  The waitresses have been there for years, they are the best!  Most delicious long island iced tea in the city.	1
I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.  Now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends.\n\nIts a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.\n\nNow, to the food:\nThe bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.\n\nThe sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new stuff.  It's awesome.	1
been here a number of times and it's my favorite German food in Pgh!	1
My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. Sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. Reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. Sweet potato fries were not edible. We ate at a table at the bar and told Andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. Since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a BAD MEAL, be warned!	0
I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  When I finally tried it, I wish I had not waited so long.  Entering Max's is like going into your grandmother's living room.  Very welcoming and nostalgic.\n\nThe menu is bigger than I expected with a variety of traditional appetizers and sandwiches along with a large selection of German items.  Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels, sausages, chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above.  All of the items we tried were full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature.  Speaking of being full, the food is very rich so you will leave with a full stomach.  \n\nThey have a good selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  The dessert selection looked delicious, but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor them on a future visit.  I can't wait to go back!	1
I have stopped going to Max's for regular meals because the food isn't so good but a friend likes to go for Sunday brunch.I find a good portion of the food is acceptable for the brunch,except the food is not kept hot or even warm on the buffet. Cold kielbasi and sauerkraut is a turn off even though it would be great if it was warmer.  The chef that makes the eggs and omelets to order is really good and the sausage is the best. The bacon and the chicken needs to be cooked a little longer as they are always half raw.\nSo much of what they have would be good if it was kept at least warm. Since they have it in chaffing dishes, I've found that the food comes out cold from the kitchen. Makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is.	0
Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.	1
Overall great German food!  I love the liver and onions above all else.  The kase spatzle is delicious, and you can't eat at Max's without an order of soft pretzels!  !	1
This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.	0
Max's was good, but I've had better.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a tired part of town. It isn't in a bad area, but I'm not sure how I would feel eating there after dark. When you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant, which is dark and gloomy. We were escorted to the rear of the tavern, which is covered in B&W pictures from the 40's, which gives it a old world tired feeling.\n\nThe menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant. I had Max's Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay. The goulash was too vinegary for my tastes, but it was okay.\n\nMy wife's Jaeger Schnitzel was good, but I've had better at Das Wald Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/das-waldcafe-newport-news).	0
Man, I just love this place.  Pennsylvanian German for sure. Some peeps don't know the Difference. If you want real Pennsylvanian German food, then this is your place. This is the kind of food that my grandmother cooked up in Erie, and my uncle sells at the butcher shop in Girard.  Go in the off hours; cause the bar is packed at lunch and late. Also go ahead and put a coin in the machine! You'll see. It pisses the bar crowd off temporarily but so worth it!	1
My first real German food experience and I can't wait to go back. Everything was delicious. I had the Max's Sausage Platter. Loved it all. Left nothing in my plate. I was with a big group of people and no one took a doggie bag home. Big menu. The restaurant has this small down home feel to it. The bar is really pretty. Great place.	1
Best German food I've ever had. Hubby and I stopped here thinking we'd just have a few beers and grab a bite to eat, but we were surprised to say the least. \n\nEverything is made in house, which is enough to win me over. We started with the sausage and cheese plate, paired with the bread basket. Homemade honey mustard, gouda, Swiss, and the best kielbasa we've ever had the pleasure to bite into. Just as we're polishing off our plate and rubbing our full stomachs, our entrees came. \n\nThe schnitzel was to die for, as was the rabbit, both smothered in homemade mushroom gravy. The sauerkraut was a perfect combination of savory and acidic. The potato pancakes topped with homemade applesauce and some sour cream were just... Wow. \n\nI would definitely recommend getting the beer sampler, awesome deal and a great way to try all of their German beers without going overboard. We'll be back, for sure.	1
This is my favorite place to go when I'm in the steel city.  The atmosphere is awesome and the staff is very friendly.  The beer sampler and Ruben is a solid choice but they also have a wide range of other options including hasenfefer and Wiener schnitzel.	1
I am taking away a star because they don't deliver. If China Taste delivered I could easily see myself eating from here weekly.  This is a hole in the wall in a seedy neighborhood but I just can't get enough.\n\nThe Chinese food is some of the best I've had.  Typically get the Hunan Shrimp or Schezwan shrimp with a side of pork fried rice. The shrimp are big and taste fresh not frozen . large and cooked perfectly and the veggies are always crisp and not soggy and over done. Also we've had the sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken.  \nAlthough the restaurant is tiny and a little run down the food is very good.\nAll the entrees I've ever had were served pipping hot. \n\nThe restaurant is really nothing pretty and there are a total of 3 tables. The restaurant is tiny.  If you're passing through the Northside check this place out.	1
If you're looking for good Chinese food at relatively inexpensive prices then China Taste is it. Large portions, fantastic steamed (and fried) dumplings, great combo selections all around a solid take-out place. Only downside is they DO NOT deliver. Other than that it is well worth it whenever you have the hankering for some Asian cuisine and a Netflix type of night.	1
The best sandwiches at amazingly great prices!  The man who owns this is super nice and so helpful!  One sandwich feeds 2 adults and will fill both of you up.  The closest thing to a New York Deli in this area.  Go in here once and you will be hooked.	1
We love the Priory!\n\nI don't remember how we found this place, but I feel so lucky we did.  A beautiful restoration of a lovely old building, the Priory is a comfortable, tasteful, beautiful hotel in a convenient part of the city.  We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating, plenty of help and advice for weary holiday travelers, always delivered with a smile.  We will return to the Priory.	1
I liked this hotel, but it is something of a mixed bag. Would I stay there again? Yes, but be sure you have a car and are okay with gritty cities.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful rooms. We stayed in the historical side and had a very nice if not very large room (queen). Some reviewers said they had a mini-frig. Note that not all rooms have those.\nBreakfast was nice during the week. \nHotel was clean.\nAwesome, fantastic courtyard. You can eat breakfast out there if the weather is nice. \n\nCons:\nLocation. This is not a nice neighborhood. But you can walk to the Strip district, the Warhol Museum, and the stadium. \nEach room is different. It's a bit like playing the lottery.\nVERY small shower.\nBreakfast was less on Sunday, as they rely on local bakeries. It's a true continental.\nYou get yelled at for bringing your own alcohol onto the property. Yeah, we thought that was weird, too. No mention of it on the website, but they don't want you to bring your own drinks into the courtyard.	1
Located in a kinda run down neighborhood, but worth it to stay in such a unique cool place. Everyone that works here is very friendly. Right after checking in and going up to our room, I noticed it smelled like stale smoke (even though this is a non-smoking hotel). They immediately switched our room, in fact they upgraded us to a much larger king room. Not bad at all for a free breakfast with a small but nice selection of meats, cheeses, and fresh fruit. The kind gentleman who works in the kitchen/tends to the breakfast buffet even went in the back and found us some water crackers for the Brie, upon request.	1
The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that the area is slighty sketchy. Theres a small grocery store on the corner, & i hated walking by it bc people would hang out outside. They do have a free shuttle! They have excellent customer service besides Matt or something. He was grumpy. Our driver Hank or something was amazing! Soo sweet. We even sent my chocolates from Hawaii to thank him. The room was good size. Bed frame was metal so it was outdated a little. Our tub wouldn't drain like it was a bit clogged. Free breakfast buffet. I loved the Steeler fans we met there. It was our first time in Pittsburgh and we had a blast!	1
Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!	1
"Was at a beautiful wedding.  Staff was terrible, unpleasant, and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills.  Nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the \""people\"" at the priory are cold, miserable and just plain miserable. I get better guest service at Holiday Inn"	0
I was very specific when I made my reservations several months ago. I needed a non-entrance level room away from noise. We were given a room right off of the hotel Foyer. It is mid-night and a party rages just outside my door even though I have called the front desk asking for their assistance. Right now I would prefer to be in a Motel6.  This room was relatively not cheap, it should have at least been cut-rate given out only as a last resort.  The next time I am in Pittsburgh it will not include a stay at The Priory, which is a shame because besides this issue it is a nice place. But if you are considering staying at this hotel why take the chance. While the party continues and I am getting no help from the front desk I am tempted to lower my rating to a single star. But, hey, I can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night.	0
"booked through a third party site and they tried to stick us in a queen room even though they had plenty of kings available. definitely gave attitude about it but \""upgraded\"" anyway. he wanted to charge me the difference but I refused. just bad service overall. no one to help with bags morning or night. even the day front desk person was short with us and rude. I couldn't wait to get out of there. the room was clean and charming. the area is definitely rough. I wouldn't stay here again."	0
"First I would like to say the Pasta Too of old had good food, this was just average.  The italian and mushroom steak hoagies weren't that great.  The steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun.  The pizza wasn't that good either.  The prices are higher than the food was good. $6.25 for 7\"" italian and $7.50 for 7\"" mushroom steak. So not worth it but I guess they figure they can get from the people who work at the hospital and with all the new housing going up.  I will not get anything from there again."	0
Best pizza in the North Side by far.   Super friendly staff, too.	1
No frills, no fake smiling employees, just REALLY GREAT BREAD. Fresh, authentic, all natural ingredients and very good prices. I regularly buy 2 baguettes here for a $1.25 or $1.50. Lots of rolls, breadsticks, rye, wheat and focaccia. It's a small store at the bakery, prices are a lot lower than at Wholey's or somewhere else in the city. Many restaurants use breadworks. Great stuff.	1
Best in Pittsburgh hands down. Pumpernickel raisin rolls are my favorite, the ciabatta is awesome...salt sticks too. They have just about anything you could think of and it's always bakes fresh that morning.	1
Breadworks has great bread although I usually only buy it in the summer because I make my own bread. I am rating it 4 stars and not 5 for one thing, the focaccia. They now stick it in pizza box and you can't see what your getting. The last 2 times I got it, the bread was burnt. At the price of this bread it shouldn't be burnt and it never was when you could see it before you got it home. I think I will stick to what I can see.	1
Went here a couple Fridays ago to go to for lunch. Pretty cool place and the food was pretty good. I had the sausage platter, sauerkraut, coleslaw, and red cabbage...mmmmm! I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes. My only complaint is that the beers were a little small.	1
In my making of places I will visit when going to Pittsburgh the Carnegie Museum had to make the list. With the many hours spent in the adjacent library and the museum itself there is really no way I could not make time when I visit. I am not sure if what seemed like ominous dinosaur skeletons are still there or not but either way it will be a walk down memory lane to go.	1
Us lucky Carnegie Mellon students could get into this museum for free, sooo I managed to make it here once a year. Looking back, I probably should have gone way more. The architecture of the building is so open, airy and bright. I love the layout and the gigantic staircase up to the galleries. \n\nMy favorite part - the gigantic room with all the dinosaur skeletons and the last room in the art galleries with the modern art... there's a really neat blue painting with concentric circles, which tricks your eyes into thinking it's breathing. crazy.	1
what can you say? just have a lot of time to spend! because its soo packed with all sorts of great works and exhibitions! dont for get to take art classes! especially if you have children- there are a lot of things to do.	1
"I'm from Detroit. We have a decent art museum, but nothing this awesome.\n\nThe Carnegie Museum houses two very nice museums. Natural History and Art. The Natural History Museum is very impressive and it's cool knowing that all the specimens belong to the museum and they aren't on loan from some hoity-toity New York museum. It's not huge like the Smithsonian, but it's certainly cool seeing real dinosaur bones. My accompaniment had to stifle all my Jurassic Park \""Mr. DNA\"" references.\n\nThe art section is also quite impressive. I personally still prefer my Detroit Institute of Art, but this museum is still nice. I got a little confused about how to walk around. I prefer my museums in chronological order, not cool to less cool, which is what this seems to be. The modern art is very cool, but after being at the Warhol the day before, I had my fill of high-concept stuff. There's quite a bit of Impressionism, which by scientific fact all women love.\n\nThis is great way to spend a long afternoon and there's plenty to do in Oakland afterwards."	1
Totally incredible way to spend an afternoon with my family - these museums have it all! Since we have a family membership (which I highly recommend), we typically pop in for an hour or two at a time, focusing on different areas of the complex in Oakland every time we go. Our daughter seems to enjoy the dinosaurs the most, but she's also intrigued by the art collection! My favorite part is the Hall of Architecture, filled with many incredible casts of facades and sculptures. Just the fact that they have casts of the Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace is unbelieveable - I don't think that casting of these timeless works of art is even allowed anymore. Don't miss out on the basement kid's room, because it's full of hands-on activities for the young ones.\n\nWe will definitely keep our membership current as the years go on - it's timeless, and always fun!	1
Awesome Dinos and terrific tour guides.	1
At this point, I am done. I scheduled my kids for the last 2 weeks in August and then due to an emergency, I had to cancel, which I did a month before their camp was to start. I was told they were issuing my refund, and that was 3 weeks ago. THREE WEEKS and i still dont have it. I live probably 30 minutes from the museum and could have driven there 63838484848485858 times by now and picked it up. Its just sooo unprofessional and annoying. They need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner. 7-10 business days are fine but 3 WEEKS is UNACCEPTABLE for it to not have even been MAILED YET. So dissapointed and will never use them again.	0
In response to the response I received from the Museum rep, I called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet, but you reponded on Yelp. This week is the 3rd week. your response stated that my refund was sent this week, if you are speaking about this current week, today is the 14th, monday and the week has just begun. If you are talking about last week, can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on Yelp. Thank you.	0
We went for friends bridal shower brunch and stayed for the art. The beauty of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh can only be described as mesmerizing. We enjoyed a beautiful brunch with flawless service. The afternoon was spent among some of the worlds best art collection. I recommend taking a tour, stopping for lunch either in the restaurant or the cafe and then finishing your day with viewing another collection. You can enjoy Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh in a day, but since the price is right why not come twice? Easy parking, friendly staff and beautiful architecture make this place one of our favorite escapes.	1
This collection is extensive and covers so many styles and periods, there is bound to be something that grabs you. The setting alone is worth the trip. On a clear day you can see all the way from the skyline to the ocean. The gardens are a delight also.	1
Heinz ketchup and pickles are terrific.  It isn't worth trying to save a nickel with watery condiments.	1
Estimated delivery time 45 minutes actually delivery time 120 minutes.\n\nPizza Hut , a pizza of last resort.	0
Ordered online and couldn't believe how fast the food came. Their honey garlic boneless wings are delicious.	1
This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The food is consistently amazing (I highly recommend the blackened shrimp pasta), the ambiance is great for a casual or more formal gathering, and the service is tremendous.  The prices are also very reasonable.  I literally crave the food from Legends....you must check this place out!	1
So Pittsburgh! This is such a neighborhood gem! We took my grandmother here for her 82nd birthday and had such a good time. Nothing too fancy, just good 'ole Italian food, made in the kitchen right in front of you.	1
Very good home style Italian... Very friendly staff. You should bring a bottle of red to go with your dinner... Worth it!	1
Awesome, cozy place. It has a friendly, family style atmosphere. The food is consistently great. The servers are inviting and seem genuinely happy to be there. \n\nI love going here on a whim. So if you're looking for a great new place to go tonight, try it.	1
Another Northside neighborhood favorite! Although the physical structure and ambiance leave a bit to be desired. The food and staff surely make up for it!  The staff is always super friendly, even when you stroll in late in the evening a glass or two of wine into your night. \n\nThe food is all house made and truly delicious! The Virginia spots are one of my personal favorites. Honesty anything you try you'll be sure to love.\n\nIt is BYOB but beware of the corkage fee per person.	1
Small, overcrowded, unfriendly staff.\n\nThe food is okay - typical Italian fair that could be better seasoned. \n\nThere are much better options nearby, but in a pinch, it's decent.	0
This is our favorite restaurant, bar none. The food is terrific, the service is top notch, they remember our names and it always feels special when we dine there. I've never had a pasta special I didn't adore. \n\nI truly feel like they are happy to see us when we come in the door and go to extra pains to treat us well and we are just an average couple who aren't spending hundreds. That doesn't matter - we are their customers. \n\nWe've been by for lunch which is very competitive price wise with nearby restaurants.	1
I go to this place about once a month for lunch and I am consistently impressed with the quality of my meals and the service. It seems like an unassuming cafe, but the food is way above average and the waitstaff is always friendly and engaging.\n\nUsually, I will get one of their sandwiches and I am especially impressed with their chicken parmesan panini. It's obvious that the ingredients are fresh and the bread is homemade. It's the kind of meal I would expect in an New York bistro, but it is right here in Pittsburgh. \n\nOverall, this is a great restaurant if you like fresh ingredients and good Italian food. Also, the conversation with the waitstaff is always so fun!	1
Its okay, but it was just ok.  \n\nThere's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard.  We were expecting that would be for the table.\n\nWe started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.\n\nThey give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.\n\nMy friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.\n\nOverall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana.	0
Very cool place to have a nice dinner.  I always go for the mussels-delicious!\n\nPasta is always fresh and tasty, too.\n\nFriendly wait staff.  This would be a five-star if they were able to serve adult beverages.	1
What a great place to stop for a good meal before a Pirates game.	1
This is hands down the best italian restaurant in the city.  Chef Dan makes you feel at home in this cozy little restaurant.  The open kitchen is very entertaining.  I usually get one of the specials as I have worked my way through most of the menu.  Every dish is better than the last.   The Antipasto appetizer is always a good choice.	1
If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I've never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant!\nTheir food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant, go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back.	0
If you're looking for a wide array of malt liquor and/or ice beer Caruso's is the place for you. Aside from their vast selection of high alcohol drinks they have a pretty decent selection of unique beers and all of the standards you would hope to find at a distributor. The prices are good, sometimes a $1 or $2 cheaper than other places.	1
Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is overcrowded.\n\nThe last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  When I complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.\n\nI'm done shopping at this store.	0
"This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated \""made in the 70s\"" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's."	0
Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience in my life. Hubby and I pulled in only to see a few cars down, people selling who-knows-what out of their car trunk. Also this is the only Giant Eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). Then we leave by waiting for a really dazed/swaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) on our way out of the parking lot. We are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again.	0
"Awful.  Worst grocery store I've ever been to.  To make it worse, they are supposed to open at 7.  At 7:10, I was told they were \""still getting ready to open\"" and I should come back \""around 7:30\"""	0
The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside.... But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for... I miss Kroger	0
"Zero stars? Really terrible store. High prices, THE WORST PRODUCE EVER (And no, it isn't the lighting...) and rude employees. \nNever mind the people hanging out out front and in the parking lot, who cares. What I'm truly concerned about is the vast discrepancy between this store and very nearly all of the other Giant Eagle locations in the Pittsburgh area. One would assume that there would be some quality control within their chain of stores. Truly sad that the North Side has so few options at which to shop for reasonably priced, fresh food. \n\nAlso, enjoy getting followed around by the walleyed \""undercover\"" employee. Looks like Lurch from the Addams Family. Good riddance."	0
So I got a call from Giant Eagle asking me to give my opinion of this store. My recommendation was to burn this place to the ground. Buckle up for crappy produce, rotten fish, old meat, and security guards that speck you be stealin! This is the Gh**to Eagle!	0
"The only reason to shop here is that going anywhere else is out of your way. The prices our worse than other GE stores and I wonder why. The produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good . The store never looks very clean. I was hopeful a couple of years ago when the store was refurbished and it was nicer for a while but now it's back to it's old ways. I have friends that refuse to go there because of the scary parking lot where people sell \""things\"" out of their cars and at the driveway exit. If there is outside cameras, the Pgh police should take a look. I wish there was an alternative to shop in the northside. Kuhns off Brighton rd is about the same except the prices are better."	0
I hate to agree with the other poor reviews of this branch, but this is definitely far from the best Eagle in the city. I'll say upfront that I never felt unsafe the three times that I have been here. However, the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor. The lines are always long and take forever to get through. Furthermore, the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par. I'd recommend stopping in another Giant Eagle if you can. However, this location DOES have a Redbox, which is nice.	0
"I've had a lot of bad experiences at this store. The employees have been rude so much that I just expect them to roll there eyes when I get deli meat. Lines are long, and there's always a crowd of people hanging out front begging for money, cigarettes, or trying to sell their food stamps. \n\nI have filed a complaint with corporate about this store before and I was contacted by a manager. I do have to say, that this manager really, sincerely cares about this store and customer experience. I talked to him for 20 minutes and he was polite and friendly. His name is Mr. Youngblood, and he urges you to ask for a manager if you're having a bad experience.\n\nProduce selection is terrible, there is not a meat counter in store, and it's just feels dirty. \n\nThis is the only grocery store on the north side, so it's not as easy to \""just go somewhere else\"" sometimes when you get off work, you don't want to drive 10 minutes to go to Kuhns on mcknight."	0
This is a small, franchise-owned location that caters to the predominantly low income households in the area. Selection is quite limited throughout the store with limited quantities on the shelf of the items they do carry. Because of the area in which it is located, the store is NOT 24-hours as most Giant Eagle's seem to be. \n\nThe pharmacy inside the store, unlike the store itself, is corporate owned, and it's staff is friendly and efficient. A stark contrast to the rest of the store.\n\nOnce again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves, there will be one of more jitney's (unlicensed cabs, effectively) waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee. \n\nIn general, if you CAN shop somewhere else, you will probably want to.	0
Dave's Barber Shop is good old fashion at its finest!!!!  The convo was perfect, sports and everything in between....cut and price also very nice....	1
The problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service.  I have never been treated in such a poor manner - and the sad part is that this SERVICE provider doesn't care.  I recommend going elsewhere.  They are not worth my money.	0
Best Cleaner in Pgh.!  If you have quality clothing , and want your clothing to look beautiful after being cleaned go to Pfennings !!! Excellent services !	1
Peanutz is a perfectly good neighborhood bar on East Ohio Street.  Their beer selection is adequate (basically all the American macro lagers, plus a few of the more widely-known craft beers, like Sierra Nevada), and their bar is stocked with the full gamut of booze (except ouzo).  Trish, the bartender, is a fantastic bartender with a hilariously sharp tongue.\n\nI haven't tried very many of the menu items, except for the chicken wings, which are a house specialty.  Everyone recommends the Four-Dip sauce, which is pretty good.  The Cajun rub is good too.\n\nDecor-wise, Peanutz is focused largely on Pittsburgh sports -- there are two large display cases with all sorts of sports memorabilia.  There's a handsome wooden bar in the front room, and a dining room off to the side.	1
I went here on a Saturday night with a few friends.  They had  a DJ so there was a cover of $3 - boo!  I'm really adverse to covers unless there's something really great going on and considering I had never been in this place before, I was taking a chance.  For those that know me, I'm not the gambling kind.  \n\nBut I thought ok it's just $3 so it's not like I'd be going broke.  The music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing.  It wasn't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks.  \n\nAm I glad I checked this place out - sure, but have I been to better dance clubs/bars - yes.  If you're in the area and looking for something to do, then check it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip to go here.	0
Get me some Peanutzz!! We decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was. Saturdays there is a cover for the DJ which was $3. This didn't seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are $15 and $20 and higher but I feel like the place could use the money. Peanutz is a small venue. The bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the DJ is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom. If you weren't at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the DJ or at you... Maybe one or two people were dancing to the music. I thought the music was awesome though - a mix of old school and underground hip hop. Beers were so cheap - I think we paid $5 for three draft beers. Woot!! However some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross. My jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke. I won't be returning even if Peanutz offered some peanuts.	0
I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:\n\n1. Jim Beam is your only bourbon. \n2. For some reason two drinks came out to $9.90.* \n3. Even with only 10 people in the bar, the music was absolutely deafening. \n4. You charge a $3 cover for no discernible reason.\n5. Rolling blunts is apparently kosher inside the bar, but sharing, not so much.\n\nHowever, I can't let this slide: your claw machine is BULLSHIT. That is the weakest claw of all time, and there's no chance it is EVER picking up anything in that cage. I feel violated, and I want my dollar back. \n___________\n\n*I think that's some sort of weird PA tax thing.	0
To start, the bathrooms are DISGUSTING, with that being said I would never EAT anything here again.  This is a neighborhood bar for me.  I've been in here a handful of times, the crowd is never rowdy or out of control.  The bar area is clean and the restaurant has a very nice mellow atmosphere. I normally only drink Coor Light drafts which are 2.75!!! that's a lot of beer for less than 3 dollars.  I have had the wings in the past, before I saw what a disaster the bathrooms were.  They fry their wings to order and they come out hot and fresh. \n\nThe patrons are a older work crowd, not too may youngsters here.  \nI have enjoyed myself here and will probably be going back again this weekend.	0
I've been here a few times. Can't beat five dollar Coors Light pitchers... \n\nThe crowd tends to be black. I tend to be white. And obviously from out of town. People are friendly. It's just a neighborhood bar. People talk to each other and have a good time. \n\nThe food is well priced and good. \n\nThe music is going to blow your ears up, if you care about that, don't come.	1
Our bartender didn't know what a pint was or how to pour a beer	0
Best place in the city to get a dog	1
"The food is good and the portions are large.  The service is terrible.  The servers are just \""too cool,\"" to show any sort of hospitality.  No personality or spark.  I don't know if they hate working there or hate serving people.  It's puzzling.  Why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude?  I have been here a couple of times and it doesn't change.  They just look at you blankly, like they don't understand what you are saying.  I've never had a staring contest with a hostess before.  It's bizarre.  I wonder if they are all on Xanax..."	0
I feel bad about giving this place such a meh review but every time I go that's exactly how I feel when I leave. Atria's is one of those places that I've never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matter.\n\nI can't say the food is bad, but it's not really great either. I will say the service is always so. It's almost as if they don't realize you have other places to go; you can just sit at their restaurant all day. On the upside the busboy's and girls are hounding your table filling your water glass after taking a sip. So if you're a horse you won't go thirsty.\n\nHonestly though. you are better off eating the park. I mean who doesn't love Manny's BBQ?	0
My husband and I are Cubs fans and flew into Pittsburgh to see Friday and Saturday's Cubs-Pirates game this past weekend (7/7 & 8).  We got to PNC Park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  We stopped first at Atria's.  Although there was only one other table occupied outside, we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people, who were eating food needed it.  This was RIDICULOUS  to us so we left!  We were paying guests just like their other guests!!  Anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at Dominic's.  We went to Dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 AND did up getting FOOD.  Atria's better rethink how they treat guests....	0
Ugh, I hate this place.  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like.  The food is overpriced.  The service is snotty and slow.  I can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  Try SoHo or Finnegan's instead.	0
The food is acceptable. They have a pretty wide range, but narrow the menu on Pirates game days. I tried the seared ahi tuna. It was good, but nothing memorable. The location appears to be the best thing about the place. Sitting outside on a warm evening, looking at the city skyline and seeing people walk around before a Pirates game is an interested dinner experience. But don't go for the menu.	0
Located right next to PNC Park, so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day. That and outdoor seating are main perks. Otherwise, food and prices are not worth a stop. This place will fill up on game day, but should be avoided when the Pirates aren't in town. It isn't a BAD experience. If you are siting outside and you have a view of Pittsburgh, it can't be that bad.	0
Here before Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS in game 3 of the NLDS, a Sunday. Game at 4:30, got here at 2:30. Packed both inside and out. Can't comment on any other time but this really hectic one. \n\nOrdered Pepsi and brisket nachos. AWFUL. Soggy chips, some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic BBQ sauce, a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalape\u00f1o slices. Not a degree above room temp. \n\nWill give them 1 star for tasty Pepsi and keeping it filled.	0
Came in late night during Light the Night, just for for drinks and a snack. Service was fast, but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing. The chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot. I was excited about the crab bisque, but they must have been running low and it must have been half sherry because it tasted like I was taking a shot of cheap white wine with every bite. Hope the dinner fare is better.	0
I came here just before a Pirates game so it was extremely busy. As a result I sat at the bar. I ordered the Pacific Salmon salad and it was absolutely delicious. The service was very friendly and attentive. The price seemed reasonable. My only issues were that there were some left over plates of food nearby that were waiting to be taken away that sort of detracted from the experience. Also, my plate did not seem 100% clean although it really wasn't a big issue. Given how busy they were I do understand and still give high marks for the tasty food and excellent service.	1
I came here on the Fourth of July after getting off of work. My friend and I stopped for one drink before the fireworks. Let's just say I will never return. I stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. The bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. They then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. It took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. I am a bartender and I am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place. I am a phenomenal tipper being that I am in the industry and sadly I didn't leave a single dollar. Hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers.  What a shame.	0
I was meeting up with 3 other people there. But I was a few minutes late.  Because I wasn't there at the time,  they refused to seat the others.  Not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered.  So they left to go to some place that would serve them (Dominic's)  This place clearly couldn't be bothered to have our business,  which seems like an odd way to run an organization.  One star because we didn't get anything that we wanted.	0
"I was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute WORST place I've ever eaten at. \n-hair in the food\n-crab cakes were touted as amazing, in reality disgusting ice cream scoops of poor crab and mayonnaise \n-\""risotto\"" uncooked and congealed to plate. \n-vegetables gummy and soaked in oil. Not properly prepped and served with woody stems. \n\nI was shocked this place turns a profit"	0
"Absolutely the best!!!  \n\nNot from Pittsburgh.  Was there on vacation with my kids.  They absolutely LOVED IT.  Even my youngest, who is hard to entertain, left the place praising it.  If you have kids and are in Pittsburgh, this is a great place to take them.  We have been to other city's children's museums and this is one of the best.\n\nThere are tons of stuff for them to do.  There is also a nice variety.  Something for everyone.  Even my wife and I were entertained.  The price of admission was well worth it considering movies are about $10 for only 1-2 hours.  We were there for at least 5 hrs and it didn't even feel like it.  The best was there were activities that left you with free \""souvenirs\"".  We left with various art creations that the kids made that were really cool."	1
Oh my God. They're playing the chicken dance song on their website! Bahaha!\n\nSo what is so great about this place? Mister Rogers of course! For those not in the know, Fred Rogers was from Pittsburgh, so of course there will be a great display of his world somewhere in the city. And here it is. \n\nBeyond that there are always cool displays up in the rest of the museem. Bottom line: Great for adults and kids alike, another of the must see Pittsburgh sites.	1
really great place to bring kids. brought my 2 year old here on vacation and she had a blast. Her favorite parts were the painting room and the water room. a must visit if you have kids.	1
I wish we'd had more time here - this place was a blast.  I speak from experience when I say you can keep an almost-two year old happy for AS LONG AS YOU WANT here.  There is even a little cafe so you don't have to leave if you get hungry.  I also witnessed a birthday party at which the kids were encouraged to yell and scream and be happy.\n\nSome of the exhibits could have used a little bit of maintenence.  The coolest thing we did was play in the water area, but a couple of the features were broken and the (young) museum employees didn't know how they were supposed to work.\n\nWe found street parking, but you can park on site for $5.	1
Awesome. Nuff sed	1
Can't get an order right! 6 of the last 8 times we ordered they have messed it up.   I know, each time I forgive them and think they can't possibly mess up again, but they do.  Not only that, but they quote 45 minutes then take anywhere from 1-2 hours to deliver.  Wont be ordering from here again!	0
Stumbled on this place on a Sunday afternoon when looking for Yelp recommended Bistro-to-go across the street was closed.\n\nLittle leery - but very pleasantly surprised!  Nice tables and chairs, pleasant service and it was fairly fast.  Woman recommended a large basket of fries to share and they were great!  The Reuben sandwiches were really good!  Two of those, a Gyro, basket of fries and drinks...a $20 bill!   \n\nAbout the only thing odd was the tiling around their deli case.  No biggie.  \n\nWe'll go back, I want to try the Pizza.  It was really good food and the prices were great!\n\nOh yeah, the Pickles were excellent and HUGE!	1
Pickles looks like a dive. The bathroom is a disgrace to mankind. The clientele...or should I say the non-client, just sitting there bothering paying customers, are a little off putting. \n\nBUT, the food is awesome... I would not want to look too closely into the kitchen... but the food is awesome!	1
I lived off of pickles in college!  The only downfall was their delivery time.  It always took almost an hour and a half to receive my food, 10 minutes down the road. \n\nI moved, still in delivery distance, and had a terrible experience.\nI called my order in and had a total of 11 and some change.  I told them I'd be laying cash.  When the delivery guy arrived he couldn't stop complaining about walking up my steps and I would have to meet him downstairs next time.  When I handed him a 20 he told me, sorry I don't have any change.  So he walked off with a 9 dollar tip after being terribly late, rude, and forgot my drink.\n\nGood food, but rude service on the phone and in person. \nI have not been back since.	0
I tried Pickles tonight for the first time.  I called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told 20 minutes.  I got there and was told it would be another 10.   It was another 20 before I got my food.  In a bad frame of mind, I tried my food.  I must admit it was good.  Not great, but good.  I didn't have an issue with the place or the other patrons.  I dig that kind of place.  But if you tell someone a time, you should be able to deliver.  The food itself warrents a higher rating, but the overall experience was a disappointment.	0
Don't do it! \n\nThe ribs are average at best. The sides are just as average as well. The bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all. The greens were decent and the macaroni salad was awful with tons of water in it. \n\nThis place is almost as bad as the now closed Mr Willie's BBQ in Squirrel Hill! I had such high hopes for this place. Oh well. That's what I get for trying to cheat on Showcase BBQ in Homewood. Now those are the best ribs in Pittsburgh and some of the best in the country! \n\nThey don't take debit or credit cards. Cash Only!	0
"One of my favorite places for take-out in Pittsburgh.  The ribs are cooked Southern style, and just the way I love them.  This is extremely satisfying slow cooked wood fire BBQ.  You have to get there early in the evening to get the chicken.\n\nThe service is quirky, but I find it charming.  The decor is \""down home.\""\n\nThe hot sauce is hotter than you might expect...so I recommend you ask for a mix, or just go for the mild.\n\nLet's just say I every so often get a craving for Wilson's BBQ, and it's always a special treat."	1
"Here we go, Steelers, he we go.  Pittsburghs goin' to the superbowl!\n\n\n\""Y'ins kicked ass this yir, playin dawn-tawn at the new stadium.\""  \n\nI love you, the best things about Pittsburgh- ever."	1
No equal. Here we go stillers here we go!!!	1
I am starting to love you guys more and more. I first fell in love in 2005. I did not have a football team growing up and it took me a while to find the right one. As I started to follow your games, I became more excited, more involved. I stuck with you through thick and thin. No jumping off the bandwagon.  I look forward to watching you guys play football every Sunday. I go out of my way going to restaurants, bars, etc, just to catch your games if it is not on local tv. I am a hardcore devoted fan that appreciates all the excitement and joy you bring me along with the frustrations and anger. I will be waving my Terrible Towel, loud and proud for you guys. Bring back the Superbowl this year and every year after that! I bleed Black and Gold. Go Steelers!	1
Been a fan since I was a little kid.  I don't know why my dad and I, who couldn't agree on anything, both loved the Steelers.  And we were from California.\n\nBut you talk about a team for all seasons and all reasons!  It took over 40 years for me to finally get to a game out here.  Unfortunately you didn't win, but we love you still the same!  Anyone willing to wear their Steelers Gear to a Raider Game, ride BART for over 20 miles to get there and walk back to the train afterwards - is a FAN Dammit!\n\nAnd one day, the five of us are going to get in an RV and drive across the country and go to a game..... right there in Pittsburgh.  Look out!	1
On a less serious note, I want to thank all the bitches who keep saying Sixburgh got lucky. I waited six days to post this, one for each Super Bowl the Steelers have won. One for each Super Bowl we've exceeded the Cardinals by. One for each Super Bowl we've won that make the Steelers the best of the best.\n\nSo ya. Thanks, suckas! You're funny.	1
1 star for your cover-2 defense that lost me $100 on the Super Bowl.  I thought yall were going to shut down Fitzgerald.  You disappointed me.  Wouldn't have mattered if that Big Ben TD didn't get called back and turned into a field goal, but damn your cover-2 D that let Fitz run wild on yall.\n\nNational Fixed League on them spread busters.  Vegas owns the NFL!  Sheiiit!!!	0
Not crazy about football like I use to be when I was a small fry but as far as football teams goes the Steeler are a SOLID TEAM! And their fans are crazy good crazy. Unless you come up against em and then their crazy bad crazy. So upon moving to Pittsburgh several years back I often hid the fact that I always worshiped the Dallas Cowboys for fear of being ridiculed beaten or both. If you live in Pittsburgh you will learn that it is wise to pay respect to the Steelers or else...	1
Not much you say about the Steelers that the sports world doesn't already know. The Steelers are the model for what all Professional Football teams strive to be. From the ownership, the players, stadium, to the fan base we have it all. The ONLY downfall of being a Steeler fan is that trying to get tickets is about as difficult as trying to catch a cheetah in the open prairie. \n\nFor those that want to experience what this is like bad can't land tickets to the game I would recommend going 2-3 hours before the game and join in the tailgating festivities. Once the game starts take your friends over to one of the many northside bars to enjoy the game. McFaddens and Bettis's are tops on that list.	1
I'm  not crazy about football but it's a nice stadium and fun to come with other people. The games are fun and the fans are great they are very into the game which fans should be.	1
Whoops - 6 time Super Bowl Champs!	1
As a '70s Raiders fan Jack Lambert's missing teeth caused me much pain as did a certain Immaculate Reception by Franco Harris. As time has passed and having visited the beautiful city of Pitssburgh, I now respect the Steelers organization and more NFL teams should be run this way.\n\nThey have great unis, cool logo only on one side of the helmet, fantastic Heinz Field and a fab base of displaced Pittsburghers all over the nation.	1
Thanks Steelers for a great 2010 season, even though WE came up short in winning our seventh championship, you've made this city proud! We'll do it in 2011 and Super Bowl XLVI in indianapolis! Here we go Steelers, Here we go!!	1
Benchmark of professional football.  Most superbowls in the sport.  Have the biggest fan following of all the teams.  Picked up steam during its dynasty years in the 1970s.  Before then, the Steelers were a terrible team.  Right draft picks, right coaching staff changes everything.  Today is one of the most feared teams in the NFL.  Their play represents the city.  Tough, blue collared in which any north east resident can appreciate.\n\nGrade: A	1
Perfect experience for this Steelers fan from Maryland. Had the walk up tour, tour guide knew exactly what she was talking about with a great personality to match. Had a really great time :)	1
"My friend lives near here so I came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving. The inside is super dingy deli/convenience store, so I was excited for a real, down and dirty deli sandwich. They have a lot of weird items in their grocery section which can be kind of fun to look through.\n\nI got an Italian \""hoagie\"" as I feel is the appropriate term for this ultra-Pittsburgh spot. It was bad. Totally skimpy on the meat, and it had American cheese and mayo, which don't go well with Italian meats at all...provolone and oil & vinegar would have made way more sense. The bread was a squishy white bun. I mean, I still ate it, but I didn't really enjoy it. It made me kind of sad. It was just a sad, floppy excuse for a sandwich. At least it was cheap?\n\nMaybe I should have gotten the chipped ham instead, since that's what they are famous for. I also suspect the location in the North Hills has to be at least marginally better...this Isaly's is clearly past its prime."	0
Out of business.	0
It's cathartic to give this sorry organization 1 star.\n\nNote: this is a review of the baseball club, not the stadium in which they play	0
We're over .500 so far this year!  Whoo-hoo!  We're actually mediocre!  And for once the Cubs are keeping us out of last place instead of the other way around!	1
I love the buccos, win or lose.  Going to the games are always a good time, and when they are on TV at the bar, I always find myself happy to enjoy my meal and watch the game.  Gotta love them battling bucs.  Please just let me see one round of Playoffs in Pittsburgh before I die..	1
I've lived in Pittsburgh for 20 years and JUST discovered St. Anthony's Chapel.   A friend of mine was visiting from NYC and, though not at all religious, he's an antiques and history freak.  He discovered SAC and urged us to take him there.\n\nThis is home to the largest collection of relics open to the public in the world and to a life-sized version of statuary of the Stations of the Cross.  The experience is breathtaking.   The tour guides -- free tours Sat through Thu at 1, 2, and 3pm -- are extremely knowledgeable and open to any and all questions.\n\nWe were just blown away by the rich history and beauty of the place plunked down in the middle of a rather ordinary corner of the North Side.\n\nIf you have guests in town looking for something out of the ordinary or if you've never been, it's well worth the schlep.	1
"I was raised Catholic (but no longer practice), and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saints--so I was really looking forward to our tour of St Anthony's. BEWARE: I can't speak for their other guides, but the gentleman (a lay person, not a priest) who \""led\"" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of TRUE believers, the infallibility of the Catholic faith, and whether we'd all found our \""charisms\"" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints, too--than showing us any relics. After an hour of his sermon--and nary a single fact about the hundreds of relics that surrounded us--we left. What a disappointment. What a huckster."	0
Jason, you are right on the money!  Scaife is part of the ultra-right-wing bunch.  I certainly don't bemoan an individual's right to his/her politics (I'll admit I'm a little left-of-center), but this Scaife guy makes Rupert Murdoch look like Al Gore.  And your tabloid comments are oh, so true.\n\nI do give it two stars because its......oh, wait a minute.... can't think of a reason for two stars.  So I'll just give it one!	0
I wouldn't pay attention to the Trib's news coverage, since it's mostly far-right propaganda. Two stars for their decent sports coverage - Mike Prisuta and Joe Starkey are worth reading.	0
Much better than Pravda, er the Gazette.	1
This conservative POS rag makes faux news look like NPR. You got Scaife, himself pumping ten million a year from his own pocket to keep the paper up and running. No one reads it, the Post Gazette is the REAL newspaper in this city.	0
I'm not a car girl and Lester couldn't have been more accommodating.  I needed an inspection and he was able to take me the same day I called.  He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best!	1
Although I've never had any of their other menu items except their gyro, I wish I would have gone elsewhere. Since I can only comment on their gyro; here goes... First, the meat is embroiled with fatty particles (it's fake meat or something), second; they don't include enough dressing, third; there are way, way too many onions, forth; there were only two very small slices of tomatoe, fifth; the feta cheese is not crumbled but in a patty, sixth; they just pile the stuff on top of a pita, - to be quite honest, it just tastes bad.	0
Nick's used to be good with the previous owner, that all changed. Which is pretty sad.	0
Nick's has legit New York Style pizza.  It's dirt cheap too!	1
This place is fantastic!  Very reasonably priced, they do a wonderful job with my German Shepherd.  Nails, ears, bath, and grooming- she looks like a new woman when they're done with her!	1
I have eaten here twice. Both times I thought the food was sub-par. The first time was a birthday lunch that was lousy, but I was feeling under the weather, so I gave it another try about a year later for dinner. It was just as lousy as the lunch. My wife definitely agreed, and although we can walk there in 15 minutes, we will never eat there again.	0
I've been there twice, and they have yet to impress me. The decor is old and dingy at best, the seats are gross, and the carpet looks to be 30 years old and identified to my grandma's. My biggest issue was the food. I just assumed that a sea food restaurant would serve fresh fish, but I was sadly mistaken. Every meal I, or friends, have had here was poorly prepared, greasy, and clearly had been frozen for an extended period of time.\nThe only plus side of the place was that it was dirt cheap, but be prepared to get what you pay for.	0
I worked at millers back in the nineties. The fish was fresh every day from wholeys, the bread was fresh everyday from mancini's, and the perogies were made by little old babushka women at St. George's down the street. \nIt was a great place to eat. People cared about the food and it showed. I can only attribute it's decline to a change in ownership. \nI stopped in to satisfy a craving for fish and was very disappointed by the grease pile I got instead. \nI used to be proud to cook there. Now I wouldn't put it on a resume for fear that people have experienced it lately.	0
been ordering chubbys for over ten years.  solid pizza at a great price.  one time, steve offered to deliver a pizza over an hour after they closed on xmas eve just because.  doesnt get any better than that.	1
Ordered a lg pizza for pick up, 30-40 min wait. Went to pick up my pizza and I arrived to have no pizza at all. They told a driver must have taken by accident. The skinny, is it took an hour for a new pizza, and they offered me nothing	0
Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here. Ordered twice in the last 90 days and both times it was terrible. Ended up waiting over an hour each time. First time I got home to find a totally different order; the send time waited over 1.5 hrs for a pizza. Both were crappy, at best. Staff was really rude both times.	0
"We just moved in a couple blocks away and thought we'd try them out. Their prices are great but, seriously, worst customer service I've ever seen. I walked in and the guy had to finish his cell phone game before helping me. I get home and realize we were given the wrong pizza. When I called to see if they had our correct one the guy tells me that's what we ordered. I assured him we didn't, I was there when my girlfriend called the order in. He just said \""sorry man\"" and didn't offer any solutions. So we just picked off the garbage toppings that we didn't order and threw most of it away. It would've taken very little effort to fix it for us. All this after it took them an hour to make the thing. I'd go back if I were desperate but it's seriously amateur hour."	0
Too much cheese on their pizzas, and the customer service is incredibly poor.  This is nothing new, we have been in Brighton Heights for many years.  My husband LOVES their buffalo chicken pizza, but after his last experience waiting over an hour for pick up, we would only order from Chubby's if every other local pizza joint was closed.	0
My dog means the world to me and I couldn't imagine anyone better to handle her care than Dr. Dorn. I grew up raising puppies as a family hobby and became very attached to quality care from a vet in my hometown. My standards for a vet are high and I was more than pleasantly surprised by WLAH. \n\nMy first experience with Dr. Dorn was no more than 2 weeks after my adoption of my dog. I was pretty certain that she had UTI and it was confirmed. He was such a nice doctor and all of his staff was understandable and sweet. It also felt like a family environment and the office building is adorable. I didn't feel like I was taking my dog to some overly commercial MedVet (the worst place you can go) or chain. The whole appointment, plus medicine, plus taking out her stitches (for free) was $45. I was in shock! It was very reasonable.\n\nNo matter where you live in the city, I highly recommend Dr. Dorn!	1
We had food delivered to our house last night from Knossos. I tried their pierogi which I found to be quite good. Also tasty are their broccoli bites and their huge ice cream sandwiches (homemade). Very recommended!	1
This place has THE WORST customer relations I've experienced in Pittsburgh since I moved here two months ago. My boyfriend was about to order a gyro, I was waiting for him at the table outside near the street with a drink and hotdog I had gotten elsewhere, there was absolutely no one else in their establishment. The person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that I was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro. He canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. Not only did Knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day, but they also lost both of us as future customers. What a petty and pathetic place.	0
"Honestly, it's pretty unassuming from the outside. Inside it's a tiny greek diner, albeit some \""Americanized\"" choices on the menu. Hello buffalo chicken gyro!\n\nBut if you are craving for a fixin' of some stuffed cabbage, potato pierogies, or halushki, this is your place. And for dirt cheap too. I think our total bill was like $10. \n\nObviously you'll get the traditional gyro's here as well, with the twist of the buffalo chicken one. Obviously, I'm intrigued. They also sell ice cream, which if I wasn't so full from my meal, I definitely would have indulged in!"	1
Very disappointed. Delivery was late, our gyros were cold and fries were soggy. I wont be ordering from here again.	0
Awful poor excuse for a gyro. Food is always soggy. Meat is pure horsec*ck. Very unfriendly staff, but what do you expect from Greek f@ggots. Will never order from here again, total trash.	0
Called on a Tuesday to inquire about replacement sheet of glass for my TEC grill. The gentleman who answered the phone said it would cost $149, take about 3 weeks, and he wanted 50% down to place the order. Then I called TEC directly. TEC said it would be $70 and I'd get it by the end of the week. It arrived today, Friday. Talk about price gouging!	0
Love this place.  I used to live within walking distance and that was a treat!  Karaoke is a great time.  The drinks are great and inexpensive and there are always great people to meet there.\n\nI miss the pickles.  ;)	1
This place is terrible and the management has acted like an entitled prick every time I was there lol... Id rather get shot at R Bar	0
What a hidden gem in the South Hills. This fun Little store carters to a wide range a spiritual curiosities. You can explore your psychic side with a modest selection of power crystals, tarot cards and scents. I found the selection of books to be helpful and spanned a wide range of interest.	1
Great shop in Dormont - very large with lots of variety.  Seems to cater to all different walks. The shopkeepers are always very friendly and helpful.  They have a great collection of candles, beads, and herbs.  My only complaint, ironically, are their stones.  The jewelry is nice (and arguably the largest collection in the city for this type of store), but the tumbled stones are buried deep in the back of the store in such gloom you can barely make them out.  They also look like they were tumbled by a lawnmower.  It's such a shame.  I wish they would bring the tumbled rocks out into the sunlight and stock up with some fresh stones.  Other than that though, they're doing a great job and we enjoy visiting often.	1
Moonstones is an excellent shop. I am from out of town but was able to order a gift basket of incense, stones and oils over the phone and have it delivered to a sick relative nearby.  Tell them what/who you need it for (e.g. a sick friend) and they will personally construct the gift basket and deliver it if not too far away Worked perfectly for me and--again--they are very nice. Ask for Amy.	1
"you can't beat a fairly centrally-located grocery store that is open 24-7 BUTTT the smell in there is ughhh.  Years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc.    You get the picture .    The high-point is perhaps the hot foods that you can get over in the deli.-area.  Some really good \""soul-food\"" .  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and etc... I will go out of my way for that stuff, sometimes ..."	0
Kuhn's is really the only convenient grocery for where we live and they do have a great selection of higher end lunch meats, etc., but I had a terrible experience with their poultry. It took several minutes to sort through the grey, fatty boneless, skinless chicken breasts and when I finally found a package that didn't appear to have spoiled, I came home to find that the breasts had never been cut into breasts. There were several large pieces with a ton of trimming to be done. Drive the extra distance to Giant Eagle if you need anything from the meat department.	0
Kuhn's automatically receive 1  for being open 24 hours. Beyond that, customer service has been great, the shelves are stocked well, prepared food and deli items are better for you than fast food with better ingredients at a better value! When I'm in the the are, this is my go-to shopping spot.	1
Really nice place.  We shop here all the time. great service, great selection.	1
Had a friend who went here. REALLY BAD experience	0
Best shop by far in the South Hills.  Purchased a Cannondale 29er there, and have had numerous service visits for various bikes.  Always helpful and always call to let you know when service is fixed.  If you are in the market for a Cannondale in the South Hills this place has better customer service BY FAR than the other South Hills Cannondale dealer.	1
Okay these guys are really good guys, they provided free bike tune-ups along the MS 150 route if you guys are familiar with that. I had an issue with my ride within 200 miles of riding and brought it in and they only charged me for parts,no labor. I really appreciate their demeanor and customer service they provided to me. I never get a pretentious d-bag attitude when I come here.	1
Absolute best place to buy a quality bike in Pittsburgh. The staff really loves cycling and shares their extensive knowledge with you to help find the best bike for you. I didn't feel like I was being up-sold anything. I really trust this place. Frequent customer for life.	1
Nice, quiet neighborhood coffee bar.  However, the elementary school a block away gets out at 3:25, and from 3-4 it can be crowded with moms and younger siblings stopping in to pass the time.  Outside those times, it's always quiet with nice music and delicious pastries.	1
Good coffee, nice walking street, good selection of teas and little gifty things, good pastries, *excellent* scones, and it's not that other green-logo'd coffee place.	1
Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God, the cupcakes are the worst EVER!!!  There is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all.  I think a fake/display cupcake would have been fresher... and maybe even taste better.  Yes, it was that bad!  Mr. Manager... try your stuff before you sell it!	0
I bought a latte.....no wait! Actually, I bought coffee and espresso and two lattes and something to munch on (not all for me I had a friend with me). When I ordered the 2nd latte I sat down and realized I didn't have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me!? Really!? Maybe it sound petty to you but I like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part! It's all about customer service and considering I had just spent over $25.00 a little foam wasn't much to ask. Good coffee. Bad customer service.	0
First,  I love CTR's coffee.\nSecond,  this location has great batistas and it's less congested than other CTR'S I've been to. \n\nThat about covers it	1
It's past 10pm, we're hungry, coming home from a wedding party that served small portions of non-edible food. We're visitors from the West Coast, know nothing of the area. Yelped for an establishment that is open late, and still serves food within a 2-mile radius from our hotel. Voila! Yelp has sent us to Huddle. Not only did we get some bomb-ass fish and chips, we got stiff drinks for cheap. WOW! I wouldn't mind coming back here just to hang out if we're in town again. Only thing is it's cash only. Good thing we still had some handy.	1
Who doesn't love being able to walk across the street to an awesome dive bar with a GREAT menu!\nMy husband and I used to go to The Huddle once a week... They have REALLY good wings (also wing nights) and food, including daily specials.  The soup was always a must have, with seafood chowder being my favorite.  I always ended up ordering way too much food because it is so reasonable priced.  We'd spend $30 tip included (always at 25% because that's what a good waitress deserves) and leave with boxes of food! Definitely a place to be checked out!!!	1
I like the double cooked wings, but they're like chick wings they're so mini.  The thing that turns me off the most about this place is they have cardboard disposable bowls for their complimentary popcorn - however they get upset if u try and use it to put wing bones or other things in it because they insist on wiping out & reusing the disposable bowls. Disgusting & totally unsanitary IMO. If they insist on reusing those, imagine where they are cutting corners behind closed kitchen doors. I'd go back for bottled beer, that's about it.	0
Best salon in Dormont, if not the city.	1
Another ugly haircut like everywhere in Pittsburgh. For $60 with the owner. Trusted the reviews, but now look like a Pittsburgh redneck. No hair on the sides and long on the back!	0
I just got lunch from here today.  For $9.63, I got soup, salad, vegetables tempura, 6 avocado rolls, steamed rice, and pickles.  It was a ton of food and more than filling enough - I didn't even eat the salad and I was stuffed.  I will agree that the wasabi was pretty weak - I added tons of it and it added almost no spice or flavor.  Even though it was a bit pricier than I was expecting (my menu was outdated and said the lunch would be $6.95.  Oops.), it was also very filling and worth it for a once-in-a-while treat.	1
sushi was dry and unenjoyable. the place itself is clean and the decor was minimal.  I was not a fan and probably won't be back.	0
Well, finally tried the place with the Green door and High Step!  Always seem to be people going in and out.  Heard from one of my kids it was just OK, cause he had take out once with some buddies.  Well, we ventured in and ordered a few things so we could share.  General Ts0's chicken was  to be crisp and Ouch spicy...Well, the outer crust was crisp, chicken was hard..hard to chew, tasteless and somewhat sweet sauce???  The Shrimp Lo Mein was Ok but the shrimp was overcooked.  The Moo Shu Pork was forgettable.	0
Yeah, don't order from here, unless it's for dumplings. since they arev fast and the potstickers are really good. Everything else we had sucked. Shrimp and Scallop with garlic was bland as hell. The Beef on a Stick was liked eating a marinated shoe with a skewer in it. Yuk.	0
Pool hall and pretty crappy bar. Not much else to write home about. Was not a fan and won't be back here.	0
Brought the family to Tom's last weekend, and was disappointed.  On the positive side, the prices were excellent, much better than the canonical breakfast spots in the strip.  However, the food was heavy, greasy, and made from mediocre ingredients.  I didn't care for the spinach  / feta omelet, the kids' pancakes were heavy, and the home fries were greasy.  True, the place felt 50s, but kind of worn out.   We won't go again.	0
Below par diner food. Fried zucchini is all breading and no zucchini. Anything fried always comes dripping in grease, I know, I know it's diner food but it doesn't have to be so greasy it makes you physically ill. I'm a big fan of blt's and there's is pretty poor. Small portion with very little meat and dry bread.\n\nBesides the food, the service is so so. Last time I was in I asked for a lemonade and the waitress forgot it, asked for mayo and there was none on my sandwich, and this was on a slow day\n\nWith eat n park down the street and Pamela's not too far away it seems you have much better places to get you're grub on. I'm giving it one star because I can't see myself ever coming back or recommending the place to anyone else.	0
I know Tom's is a South Hills staple, but other than the convenience of it being open 24 hours a day, I'm not impressed. Even by greasy spoon standards this isn't great. The wait staff is hit and miss. Some are friendly and attentive (there's an awesome Greek lady there that I love), but just as often drinks sit unrefreshed for an entire meal and I can't get anyone's attention to prepare the check. The food is really bland (hard to make a boring grilled cheese, but they manage it) and priced pretty high for what it is. I've been there five or six times in an effort to find a reliably good menu item, but I've given up. It's just bad.	0
I've given this place enough 2nd chances and have had my last meal at this DIVE.\nFood is mediocre at best and you can't get any service because the \nwait staff is always outside having a cigarette. Very unappetizing to watch\nthem and the cook smoking then come back inside and NOT WASH THEIR\nHANDS. DISGUSTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
After living in Seattle and going to a number of amazing diners, I was thrilled to find Tom's. It tends to be a little greasy, but I love the food. I've been there at least 6-7 times, never a bad experience.\nDISLIKED that the bathroom is hard to find without asking.\nPERFECT hangover food. \n\nI will be back!	1
Excellent food and a great Dormont staple. Open late so that is awesome. Just had their wings for the first time. I have to say, The wings are scrawny, but the sauce is great. So great that it almost completely makes up for the lack of wing size. The gyros are excellent too. Great prices and great food.	1
Any place where I can crack up, cut up, let my hair down and be loose is a place I love to be. It's a diner , kinda of self explanatory seeing as to how that's part of the name.  So they have your typical dinner fare, breakfast items, sandwichs CHICKEN TENDERS.  You get it, I don't need to explain a diner to you. \n\n\n Don't judge me I'm usually wasted upon arrival to Tom's Diner it's not a place where I plan on ending up just a place that I manage to get lol.\n\nAnyhow the pancakes are good and the wait staff is down to earth and very tolerant. \nIn my opinion it's not worth a trip across town, but with friends in Dormont it's a sure stop if I'm visiting over that way. \n\nEnjoy!	1
I came in and a waitress came to our table , took our order and then walked away. Another lady came to us and asked what we wanted , then the first girl came back and asked us again!!! The restaurant has 4 people. This is not good! Write it down you dumb blonde	0
I stopped by Monday, the first day I felt it was nice enough to take my munchkin for a stroller ride.I like the simple clean layout of this place,no clutter and you can see a lot of the kitchen always a good sign. I asked the woman working the counter for suggestion. She pointed out the chocolate thumbprints and while she bagged those up I spied individual pineapple upside down cakes. So I scored 4 cookies and 2 lil cakes. The cookies were very good mixture of firm and gooey. The cake was realllllly delicious.Moist with a crispy kinda crust outside,just perfect. My husband did get his cake but i really had to restrain myself because he left it for over 24 hours! I ate all 4 cookies.	1
Read my first review... loved this place... Today I stopped in to look around,my niece was with me and I remembered that they had help wanted postings somewhere.. she inquired and the teenage girl behind the counter was SO rude, full on glaring and rolling of the eyes! NO JOKE. I wish that the manager had been in but hopefully she keeps track and knows what her counter staff is like when she is gone! I will go to party Cake shop from here on...There are too many great places to put up with attitude!	0
"I stopped in after breakfast at The Dor-Stop to see what they had to offer.  Potomac has yummy pastries at a good price.  That's pretty much all I can say.  They have a wide variety of goodies to choose from, something to make everyone happy I'm sure.  It seemed like every time I asked, \""What is that?\"" I wouldn't even let the woman behind the counter finish her description before I would reply, \""I'll take one of those.\""  I will definitely return."	1
"One of the best pastries I've had in my life I got here. I think it's called a \""French bearclaw.\"""	1
Ok , SOOOO I feel the need to try these places ! Please let me know if you agree ?\n\nhttp://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/top-lists/best-doughnut-shops-in-pittsburgh/\n\nI just made a stop here on my way to work this morning as my first Donut challange.\nThese guy's KNOW how to make a big man SMILE ! \nWhat A NICE selection , great people , Excellent yummie donuts.\nAll I can say to Potomac Bakery so far is WOW !\nI intend to try the other Bakery's on CBS's list , and I'll keep ya updated .	1
We were having a Gender Naming Party for our first baby and we were excited to share this moment with friends and family. When we went to pick up our cake we were extremely disappointed in the way the staff handled our order. The mother to be on picking up the cake found out the gender of the baby! Without her husband! This was supposed to be a surprise at the party but it was on the receipt. How terrible! They knew when we placed the order that this was supposed to be a secret. When confronted with their error they were dismissive, condescending, and there was no effort to compensate her for her pain in finding out the gender at the bakery. We have done wedding cakes here, and many special events over the years. Never again!! Potomac Bakery you should be ashamed.	0
Their baked goods are simple and DELICIOUS. The taste speaks for itself, no frills necessary. Potomac is the best bakery in the South Hills. \nLifelong regular here and I will always be!	1
A Dormont treasure!  We love their cookies and pastries, going there for goodies is a time honored special treat.	1
This was the worst hotel that I ever stayed in. my hubby and I  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that I wanted to throw up. I was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed. in the morning at 5am I wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up! I felt so dirty that I took two showers AT Other HOTEL. I never thought that I will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel.	0
"I've never been to Pittsburgh before and I planned on doing some heavy partying and needed a place to crash that was not on the floor so I booked this hotel the day before I drove up. I saw the reviews & ignored them because I figured I'd be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bed.\n\nI checked in around 2am, the girl who checked me in barely said anything to me besides \""initial here and sign here and your room is over there\"". The room smelt like hot dogs, the AC wasn't working at all so I was dripping in sweat all night, none of the lamps worked at all, there were holes in the pillow cases and bedding, there was a tiny blood stain on the sheet, I went down for the continental breakfast at 9:30am (it ends at 10am) and they already stopped serving, the shower was ice cold. I then checked for bed bugs after realizing the shithole I spent the night in last night (coast is clear). I checked out and went back to Baltimore, which seems like heaven on earth compared to Shittsburgh."	0
Square Pizza is a great Pittsburgh area thing that alot of people just don't understand Beto's is new to me there is Tons of Cheese and Pepperoni and great Sauce very generous with toppings a little expensive but well worth it.  If you like this pizza try Osso's in Washington PA.	1
From reading other reviews and dining guides, it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place. Either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking, or you don't. I fall into the later category: I didn't like it at all.\n\nI ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad. For the pizza, the crust was salvageable after I pushed aside a good quantity of cheese (most of it). The salad was...nothing short of horrific. Overloaded with fries and (big surprise) more cheese, getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging. Eventually, I found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below.\n\nI don't get this place.	0
Sorry, but our pizza was cold.  All nine cuts of it.  And the garlic wings didn't taste like garlic.  Maybe it was an off night?	0
This is my Man's favorite pizza place.  When he has visited Pittsburgh in the past without me, he sends me picture messages of his slices.  On the plane ride coming into Pittsburgh last week, all he could talk about was Beto's.  So, when we landed we of course drove right over (after being awake all night on a red eye flight) so that I could taste all that is awesome in Beto's pizza slices.  It was very good.  We ordered the simple extra cheese pizza.  For those of you who are like me (from Oregon where I guess NO pizza is good), this pizza was hot crust, sauce, and minimal melted cheese, with fresh cold mozzarella piled HIGH on top.  I have never had a slice of pizza put in front of me with so much cold cheese piled on it before.  I wasn't exactly sure how to eat it, but figured it out, and it was very good, different but good.  I would take Beto's pizza over Oregon pizza any day.	1
This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here.	0
This is the kind of pizza where the toppings are added after the crust is cooked. Cheese included. It's a novelty, and for some folks it's their favorite pizza. The taste is good, if a little weird, but for me, it didn't satisfy my pizza craving.\n\nThis location was crowded and the wait was long, but the people were nice.	0
I absolutely LOVE betos\n\nWhen i first moved to Pittsburgh i actually hated it and refused to get the pizza, so i would just stick with the Italian Hoagie..... Yummmm it is probably the best hoagie in the burgh, no jokes.\n\nThe pizza i grew to, and i assume that some people have to do the same. But boy did i grow to it fast once i did. I remember one day just trying a slice and was in love with it. I think it has to be the sauce, it is so so so so sweet and just abosultely amazing. The cheese is also amazing because it makes the hot cold sensation just that much better. I always get 2 slices, 1 mushroom 1 plain and an italian hoagie with lettuce pickles mayo \n\nI truely cant wait to get back to the burgh to have some betos\n\nA down side to betos is it gets pricey if you eat alot. But hey if thats what good pizza costs then so be it, im happy with it	1
"I tried the \""cold cheese and toppings\"" slice that Beto's is famous for.  If you have heard about there style of serving pizza, and are wondering what the punch line is, there isn't one.   They make a big square tomato-sauce pizza and throw cold shredded cheese and other cold toppings on it, and that's it. There's no secret ingredient or special something  that makes it tastes like anything other than what you would get it you grabbed pizza fixings from your kitchen and forgot to bake them.\n  \n I guess a lot of people like it, and more power too them. But I don't get it. Ramblin' Boy didn't get it. I see zero reason to agree with people that say that this is the \""best\"" pizza in the region. \n\n Maybe their hoagies will be better."	0
Canned green peppers!?! Way too much cheese. The yinzers seem to like it. The average BMI in that place was probably close to 30 and no wonder; the food is incredibly unhealthy. The pizza crust tasted like Pizza Hut. Maybe this place gets good reviews because it's a unique twist on unhealthy; loads of uncooked mozzarella.	0
"Wow, just wow. That was without a doubt the worst \""pizza\"" I've ever had in my life. Maybe you would like it. Do you like all of your toppings out of a can? I didn't even know you could get canned green bell peppers. Do you like your slices of pizza to be covered with a huge several inch thick mound of uncooked mozzarella cheese? If answer is yes, then maybe this place is for you. It is definitely not for me."	0
"This \""pizza\"" was the worst food I have ever eaten."	0
I don't get it. Cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza? Why does Pittsburgh have to be so weird? I just got accustomed to fries and coleslaw on my sandwiches but a guy has to draw the line somewhere. And what's with everyone bagging up their extra cheese and taking it home? \n\nMy gut tells me this would be an awesome pizza if only they'd cook it.	0
This is a place you either love or hate   I love it!  every time I am in Pittsburgh I have to stop in and get enough so I have take home.  The pizza is sold by the square slice.  The sauce is chunky tomato based and baked with cheese. period. after it comes out of the oven it is sliced and heaped with more cheese and what ever topping you want.  I suggest just sticking to the peperoni.  The toppings are not cooked, the cheese melts a bit but not all the way and the peperoni is lukewarm at best.  My mouth is watering while I write this.  You probably will not see 3 stars on any reviews.  Give it a shot	1
I love this place.  Every time I am town I have to stop and pick up a couple cuts.  I even take them home with me to Baltimore.  They are great even days later.  Coming to town in a couple weeks and am I definitely taking some home to my fiance.  Cheese cheese and more cheese please.  This is my favorite pizza ever.	1
Great food and great pricing.	1
No way. A ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza? No no no. No beer either.	0
Been going here for years, and will continue...I agree with some of the others, you will either love it or hate it.. It's just different, but classic in its own way... Square cut pizza with cold toppings... So frigging good...just let the cheese melt.....	1
I knew the original owner of Beto's and she would be furious for what is being done to it, now.  If the pizza slice gets any smaller, you'll have to call it a breadstick.  There was almost NO meat, on my Italian hoagie, which used to be the best around.  Whoever recently took over, should be ASHAMED.  Betos now STINKS.	0
Worse than store freezer pizza. What with the cold cheese on top of hot pizza? Terrible. If you want quality; Fiori's is a few miles away.	0
Good pizza as well as other great menu options.  Good prices too.	1
Didn't live up to my expectations at all.  Waste of time and money.  Sloooooow service.	0
My husband and I had this pizza for the first time last night.  He suggested it after hearing recommendations from friends.  This was the most disgusting excuse for a pizza I've ever had! We ordered pizza for pick up.  The girl told my husband 20 minutes and he picked our pizza up in a timely fashion.  The best thing about this pizza was the crust.  That was it! It was cold! It was not even warm like it had been warmed up before my husband picked up our order.  We got two extra toppings, which were just heaped in a pile on the middle of our slices.  These were cold too. And mushrooms from a can!!! Why am I paying extra for disgusting canned vegetables.  The sauce had absolutely no flavor and was completely cold. I would never go to this place ever again.  It was a lazy excuse for a pizza.  Who gives someone a COLD pizza for pick up?!?!?	0
I love Beto's pizza! It is not always the same though. Occasionally you get a day when it's off. It is also not for everyone. Tons of unmelted cheese, whole tomatoes, very crispy crust. If your up to try something different, Beto's is it. Their hoagies are also very good. They aren't super expensive, and I like how you can get as many cuts as you want. Sometimes I just don't want a whole pizza!	1
Either you get it or you dont.  \n\nThe cold cheese might sound weird, the toppings being cold might not sound good, just shut up and try it.  This pizza is unlike any you've had before but if you like pizza it is a must have.  I dont make a trip to Pittsburgh with out stopping by Betos.  The toppings are plentiful, the cheese is ridiculous and the crust is super crispy.  Love this place.	1
"Whaaaat?! Noone's reviewd Scoops? This place is the ultimate hangout. Young and old alike. The prices are average, the flavors are plentiful, and the staff is always friendly (always a plus on my list.) \n\nIt's a few blocks from my house and I remember on hot summer days grabbing my sisters, yelling upstairs to our parents \""We're going to Scoops!\""  and walking up there. We'd taste the flavors we were trying to decide over (they give you little spoons to do this!) and then we'd pick. There's also an assortment of frozen yogurt, sorbet, milkshakes, toppings, candy, and sodas, too! After paying, we'd take our cones outside and sit on the steps chatting well into dusk. \n\nMany people come here all year round. Everyone in the neighborhood knows each other and you're bound to run into someone you know.\n\nGreat place for ice cream and making memories."	1
Sweet little shop - great place to take the kiddos, and nice to see a huge selection of hand dipped cones and it's a nice departure from the yogurt bars.	1
"Eat'n Park is known for their \""Smiley\"" cookie (like a chewy black-and-white sugar cookie, but white, with a smiley face drawn in icing).  My wife insisted on going to Eat'n Park on our trip to Pittsburgh.  But she hates the Smiley cookie.  What drew her was the strawberry pie.\n\nThe pie itself merits four stars.  It's inexpensive ($2.99, and a whole pie is less than $10) and bursting with fresh, huge berries.\n\nFried zucchini ($5-6) is listed as an appetizer, but is enough for a meal, and comes from a local farm in Butler.  The freshness really shows in the taste.  It's breaded with a cornmeal batter, which produced some really tragic consequences for me an hour later.  90 minutes after that, however, I no longer regretted eating the fried zucchini.  Yes, it was that good.  I wouldn't do it again, mind you, but in retrospect, it was worth it."	1
Mediocre and poorly made! You can get better quality food from Mcdonalds don't waste your time or money	0
I would give this eat n park location zero stars if I could. I arrived at 11:15am and was seated quickly but that was about it. My waitress did not come over until 11:41. I did not receive water or any service for 26 minutes.  That is outrageous to me, I've never had anything good to say about this location and will not be visiting again.	0
We come here a LOT and are usually quite happy. The fried pickles are ridiculously good!! Decent off street parking, good selection, open 24 hours and the staff is usually great.	1
My experience here was not good my family and I were seated all the way in the back of the Resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront. We were the ONLY African Americans in the restaurants not even one as a busboy we had some stares but no one was rude just very quiet . The waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that, the food wasn't good it lacked lots of flavor \nI wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone keep driving	0
Who does not love a DQ Blizzard? And I heart the Girl Scout Thin Mint Blizzard. Next time, I will get the mini size. The small filled me up before I finished!	1
Peanut Buster Parfaits rule! I'm glad we have one so close. Nuff said!	1
When my favorite lamp stopped working, I went to Lighting by Erik because they were close to my home. I was initially pleased by the private parking lot as parking can be an issue in that area. The service I received was outstanding.. I was told that I could save about $30 by fixing the lamp myself, and was directed to the technicion who quickly showed me the parts and how to do the repair. I was very impressed by his expertise and customer service, and learned he has been doing this for 45 years. They really went out of their way to help me out on the spot, and it made my morning. I was also impressed by their chandelier selection and will definitely visit again to shop.	1
I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed. If you are thinking about going here know this:\n\nIf you grew up in the South Hills, all the people from high school that turned out to be real losers will be hanging out here. (Hey, I've been there, so I am not throwing stones.)\n\nIt is otherwise your typical South Pittsburgh yinzer bar. There is always a seat, and there are free pretzels.	0
Yum. \n\nI love when places surprise you! Brunch is my passion so I am always on the hunt for new spots. I love the Pamela's scene but sometimes you need that bloody mary to hold you off until you can dig into your home fries. \n\nBLOODY MARY BAR, O HEY! \n\nPros: breakfast and booze, huge portions ( I got a side of oatmeal and it was double a meal portion), CHEAP!!!!, Early hours \n\nCons: Parking is a bitch, slower (a huge party sat before us though) \n\nDef will be back for some day drinking	1
I've been to Cain's quite a few times, since I live right down the street.\n\n\nThe best times I have had at Cain's consist of myself going into the establishment with the predetermined mentality of spending way too much for drinks ( $7.00 for a Jameson and Ginger!!??) and already being three sheets to the wind. \n\nDon't get me wrong, if you like going to a place that mildly reminds me more of a mosh pit at times than an actual drinking establishment, you would love Cain's. Definitely, avoid going on the weekends.\n\nBut, I will admit that Cain's is an awesome place to post up at the bar, drink a few beers, and catch a Pen's game on one of their million TV's. \n\nBottom line : This place is not a place where you and your buds can go and get poopy drunk at. Cains is, at best, a bar where you stop during a bar crawl for a beer and a shot. \n\nNothing more, and nothing less.	0
It was our first visit to Cains and we were very pleased. Food was very good and reasonably priced. We will be back if ever in Dormont	1
"This was a solid stop for a lunch with my grandma and my mother.  As we drove by, my mother said, \""Oh, Cain's that place brings back memories.\""  So, I told her to pull on over because we were going in.\n\nAfter seeing the abundant sauces, I had to go with the wings.  I was very happy with them.  The sauces were plentyful and very different.  I got the mild garlic parm and the signature Mean Green, which was a mix of peppers.  Both were delicious and came with carrots, celery, and ranch free of charge!!\n\nMy mom's mushroom chicken wrap was huge and delicious, and her sweet potato waffle fries were great.  They could have been a little more crispy, but that is just how I like them.\n\nNow my grandma's sandwich was good, but it were the homemade chips that had me in love.  They were phenomenal.  Next time I night jut make a meal out of their chips."	1
Have heard that Cain's serves a mean breakfast.   Sure enough, they do!\nA large menu to select from and a Bloody Mary bar.  \nMany big groups and families chowing down.  \nIt was crowded but when we walked in there was an empty table.  \nService was pretty good.  It did take a little while for the food to come out but the place as packed and we were not in any hurry.  \nMy fritata was good and the home fries were good too.\nJust get there before noon, if you want breakfast.	1
Great beer on tap selection.  Stopped there for lunch recently and had a salad that will bring me back there again soon.  Many, many TVs in the bar area, so this would be a great place to watch a sporting event.	1
"Went here because the Chinese restaurant a couple of doors down from Cain's that we were going to was closed. The noise in this place is over the top, so much so that we couldn't have a conversation. We were hungry so we stayed and I'm glad. I got the \""Cod father 2\"" with a side of onion rings. This comes served with french fries and coleslaw and hot sauce served on top. I asked if all the stuff be served on the side because I'm picky about coleslaw. This is a great sandwich, even deconstructed. The cole slaw is creamy without being soggy and the fries are fresh.The onion rings were stellar. My companion got a rubin and she said that it was pretty good.I was too full, but she got a brownie with ice cream and she was very pleased."	1
This place is just average. The service is subpar at best and the waitresses always seem rushed. However, their wings and wing flavors are good, and they have so many tv's there isn't a bad seat in the house if you're there for a game. Now that the parking lot across the street is gone, good luck looking for a spot. I would go back, but only for the wings and the spicy cheese bites.	0
Great place to watch a game. Friendly staff went out of their way to get my game on even though the Steelers were on at the same time.	1
I just moved in the neighborhood and don't have my laundry room set up yet. I went here to wash my bed sheets and it was a pretty typical laundromat. The woman working was very friendly and helpful (telling me the best machines to use for what I was doing)	1
Pretty good laundromat, though not without it's...quirks.\n\nSince my apartment doesn't have a laundry room, this is the closest laundromat for me to wash my clothes.  \n\nWhat I like about this place is that it's bright, pretty clean, and the attendant is very friendly.  If you go at a good time (weekday evening or early morning on weekends) it's also pretty empty -- which I like.  They also have a little sitting area to hang out in, rather than having to lean against your washing machine.\n\nThe downside is that it's more expensive than other laundromats I've been to, and the dryers are pretty tricky (some take forever to dry your clothes, some run too hot, sometimes make your clothes smell like gas... not sure about that last one) so that part is a bit of a guessing game.\n\nOverall, the positives outweigh the negatives.  Any laundromat you go to is going to have some inconveniences, but this is by far one of the nicer ones I've used.	1
"I love this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved to a smoke free environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly and very \""with it.\"" This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!"	1
The banana oatmeal pancakes were really special.	1
Went this this morning and I am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here. Awesome food, fresh and the staff was even better. Won't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg! Gotta get here	1
OMG!  Hands down the best pancakes I have ever put in my mouth. Sometimes I day dream about Dor Stop pancakes.  Too bad I live 6 hours away or I'd go there everyday.  \n\nThe service was just ok, but the place was packed and the food was well worth the wait.	1
The Dor-Stop is my new favorite place to have breakfast, narrowly beating out my own kitchen table. I love the eggs, the home fries, and the friendly but harried service. The Dor-Stop is almost always packed with customers, and for good reason. \n\nOne small quibble: please, for the love of all that is holy, get rid of the fake-o Mrs. Butterworths and put out some real maple syrup for those tasty pancakes. Really, Dor-Stop, you're worth it. I believe in you.	1
Been here twice. Hate to say it but nothing special. The usual breakfast items but nothing stands out either in preparation or presentation.	0
After remembering seeing the Dor-Stop on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, we stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning at around 10AM.  Beating the brunch rush was great.  We had a short wait but were seated quickly.  Service was friendly, if a bit rushed.  My omelette was tasty, as were the accompanying home fries.  Everything was fresh and well-prepared.  I would return, and it's the kind of local joint I'll look forward to bringing out-of-town guests to.	1
My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!	1
Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype.	0
This place has some seriously good breakfast.  They have many good things.  The pancakes looked awesome and I would get them next.  I had the Guy's version of the jumbot and it was delicious.  The cinnamon rolls are great too!  \nIt is a busy place for good reason.	1
"For my group of friends, this is the ultimate post-5K run reward!\n\nHere are the rules (they are my rules, but you should adopt them for Dor-Stop success):\n1. Go only with 2-4 people (otherwise you are one of THOSE parties that will hold everything up and screw up the seating)\n2. Be prepared to wait.  If you do not wait, consider yourself the luckiest person alive.\n3. Order something savory (may I recommend the Breakfast Burrito or the Eggs Benedict?  Everything has a twist and a funny name, so you're going to spend some time actually reading the menu.  Get something special, don't just go with scrambled eggs and bacon - although I'm sure that's delicious too).\n4. Order specialty pancakes \""for the table\"" (to share).  We haven't been able to get away from the drawing power of the pumpkin pancakes yet.  They are so thick, yet so fluffy at the same time!\n\nThe surprising news: they take credit cards (it gives off a \""cash only\"" vibe).\n\nThe opportunity area: syrup that does not come in an old-fashioned squeeze bottle!  It takes me about 15 minutes to get the disgusting amount of syrup I want atop my fluffy pancakes."	1
Guy's Jumbot Plate O'Crap - Made a special trip in with my son this morning to enjoy the food at the Dor-Stop.We both made the same order Guy's Jumbot. When the order arrived mine was over cooked , the egg portion resembled the dry pressed paper used in the egg carton. My serving was served without cheese. My son's was fine. When I went to pay and said something I got a vacant stare and I am so sorry. I ended up with a take out for my dog to eat. teh toast was perfect though. I started makeing this hour long trek with family members about a year ago. We would come out about every 4-6 weeks. The last two trips the quality has started to slip a little...but never to this extent that it really mattered.Save yourself the effort ....This is not a Diner, this is not a drive-in...this does not even rank high enough to be a Dive. Denny's would be a better choice.	0
"While the Dor-Stop is a cute place on a nice tree lined street, I'm not sure what the big fuss is all about. The food was only fair and they don't even have real cream for your coffee. It's that nasty fake nondairy crap. It also gave me the heebeegeebees due to the \""Christianesgue\"" motif."	0
We used to live right around the corner from this delicious Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives spot, and I'm so sad to now live 30 minutes away. The pancakes are definitely the best item at this dive - the chocolate chip and pumpkin are to die for! Service is also pretty quick for a location that has such a cramped dining room and tiny kitchen space. Plan to wait a bit (maybe 30 minutes or so) for a table on Saturday mornings!	1
Didn't even know this was a DDD place. We just searched Yelp for something decent in Pittsburgh. The Dor-Stop did not disappoint. The stuffed raspberry French toast was insane. The waitress warned me it was really sweet, but I felt that it was perfectly balanced.\n\nDefinitely check this place out, and don't be freaked out at the potential of long waits. We waited 20 mins at 10 am on a Saturday. You'll be fine.	1
I recently walked to the Dor-Stop from my new place in Dormont. I've heard good things, including (of course) that they were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.\n\nIt was a weekday at around 11am, and the place was still packed. I sat at the counter after a brief wait, because it was the only available seat in the house. The gentleman next to me, as it turns out, is related to the restaurant owner. He gets a five-star review, but I swear I'm not even taking that into account with my official five-star Yelp rating.\n\nThe wait staff was very busy, but also attentive. Great mix of friendly and efficient. I couldn't decide what to order - everything sounded amazing. I ended up getting banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were probably the best I've ever tasted. A little crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I used ZERO syrup. I prefer my bacon a little crispier, but it was still good.\n\nI'll be back to sample a more lunch-y entree. In the mean time, though, five stars for sure!	1
You know how JImmy Buffet has Cheeseburger in Paradise? Mine is more like Pancake in Paradise and this place is it! \n\nWhile Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes, The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!\n\nI split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!\n\nThe only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides! \n\nI think there's some other stuff on the menu, but who knows if I'll ever even experience them... how can I with those pancakes!	1
AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally made it.  Ever since I saw it featured on the Food Network I've been wanting to go.\n\nWe went for breakfast and I ordered the stuffed raspberry french toast.  I ended up getting the cherry though...  I took a bite and while it was good I really wanted the raspberry.  I let them know and they quickly replaced my order with what I wanted and took it totally off the bill because they felt bad I had to wait longer for my food.  That was really unexpected and really nice!\n\nOnce I tried the raspberry stuffed french toast I loved it, really really good.  There are so many other things on the menu that I would love to try as well such as the banana chocolate chip pancakes, the breakfast burrito, ect.\n\nI would certainly go back to this place and hope that I do the next time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  So so good.	1
Fantastic. Best hotcakes around and I've never had a bad meal here.  The staff is friendly and personable.	1
Wow!!  My wife and I had breakfast at the Dor-Stop this morning and it was outstanding!!  We had about a 20 minute wait to get in but it was worth it.  The service was fast and the food was great.  We will surely return......	1
I stopped by for lunch and had the steak salad.  It was pretty yummy but the steak had too much fat on it. The reason why I am giving it only 4 stars is because my steak was not done the way I requested and our waitress had zero personality.  I recommend going here for breakfast and not for lunch.	1
LOVE this place!!  Awesome pancakes.  Awesome food.	1
I am always up for trying out one of those places featured on food network. The wait to get into this place was long and goes out the door. Its a very small restaurant with about 15 tables at best. Its one of the divey places where the staff clearly knows what they're doing and does it right. when we finally did sit and order service was fast. I had a meat omelet with hashbrowns. Im not much of a breakfast person so I wasnt overly impressed with it. Large portions though. I would come back here to try more of the menu.	1
Folks this is very overrated.. they had Guy's Diners Drivein and Dives there only because Guy's parents knew owner. This is very avg food at best. Its nothing special.I wont go back.. Very small and uncomfortable. They have a large sign in window to play on Guy's visit a number of years ago. Dont fall for it.	0
I really, really wanted to try Dor - Stop, but it wasn't open when I went! My wife and I woke up early just to go there, and the diner was closed for the next few days, EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE WEBSITE! Such a waste of time. If you're going to go, make sure you call ahead, just so you don't get screwed over like we did.	0
great breakfast place...period. worth the wait. had the stuffed french toast, and the bob's special. french toast was crisp and cooked perfectly, although not really stuffed, just an extra slather of raspberry jam. Bob's special was very tasty, German potato pancakes were a little under cooked but great tasting.  Service was quick and brisk, waited about 25 minutes on a Sunday morning, which was not bad but it was raining this day.	1
I stopped in here after seeing the place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. I had a late breakfast with my boss, as we were both in town from Miami to do some research for the travel section in the magazine I edit.\nUnfortunately, this was the first DDD meal that didn't leave me wanting more. The marquee dish on the show was the Jumbot. I had it and it didn't do very much for me. That said, it wasn't bad either.\nOn the bright side, my boss said that Dor-Stop's was one of the best eggs benedicts he'd ever had. He's very critical of restaurants, so I take that praise pretty seriously.\nService was as friendly and informal as yo	1
They have one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. I have never had anything bad here. Great meat products, just don't get the sausage patties. They are not of high quality, but everything else is. French Toast is excellent. Pancakes are good, but are really sweet like a donut. You have to be in the mood for them. Like I said they are very sweet. Only negative of this place is the restaurant is small and crammed, it is always packed, and there is always a wait.	1
A little biased since I live so close, but I love the Dor-Stop. Great, typical, greasy spoon diner. Always give the special a shot.	1
Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes.  Everybody told me I HAD to try and their pancakes.\nWell, the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes.	0
Great Breakfasts!  Worth the wait to get a table since Diners,Drive ins and Dives had been there. Pancakes are very fluffy and waffles too!	1
Great little local diner!! Must go if your in town.  Food was amazing and all made from scratch!!  Had the Pumkin Stuffed French Toast today!! Perfect size portions. Wait staff super friendly. Gets crowded, but never a long wait. Highly recommend.	1
We were in Pittsburgh from out of town and read the reviews so we decided on Don Campiti's Pizza. Urban Spoon rated 91% favorite. This pizza is not good. Honestly, it tastes like Geno's frozen pizza from the grocery store. The pepperoni was very good. The crust was super thin and tasted like a salteen cracker. I've had much better pizza and will be exploring other options next time I'm in the burg.	0
I First Met Don in 1973 when I ordered my first Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza.\n\nDon use to work the counter himself and was always a very customer service kinda guy.\n\nI really miss him , but I'll never miss this Pizza cause I'll ALWAYS be a customer.\n\nAs far as rateing , this place will be on my TOP 5 till I die.	1
Great pie...I could eat a whole large though...if you like a thin crust, you will love this	1
People really are nuts about their pizza in the 'burgh - this I'm learning. \n\nI ordered a pizza from here because it's in my hood (walking distance, even) and because someone told me it's been their favorite pizza since they were wee little. I think a lot of places in Pit have false-yum status because people are just emotionally attached to things they've eaten for so many years... I don't fault them for that, but this just isn't great pizza, in my opinion.	0
The Hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment.  We moved in to the neighborhood, and all we heard was Campiti's this Campiti's that, and how it is without a doubt, the best pizza in the Burgh.\n\nSo, of course we tried it, and were pretty excited to do so. Now I have lived in several different Pittsburgh neighborhoods, and you always find the pizza you like where you live. Campiti's pizza is not the pizza I like. I wouldn't order a pizza from them again.\n\nHonestly, it was about up to a frozen pizza standard. Now, I'm not saying they are making frozen pizzas, they aren't but, I have even had better frozen pizzas than the pizza we got from Campiti's.\n\nAnother reviewer hit the nail on the head saying people who say this is the best pizza around probably have some long running emotional attachment to this place That can be he only logical reason that people actually say it.\n\n.	0
Disappointed after hearing so many good things. Pizza crust is like a cracker. Hoagie is pretty good, but does not remove the disappointment over the pizza. I think Molly's Pizza next door is a lot better....I won't order from here again.	0
Compared to the original Don Campiti Pizza of the 60's and 70's this is not even close. The legacy of a superior pizza in Dormont has lost it. No longer up there with Beto's and area best. Sad to say this pizza was so bad. I have been a diehard customer of the 60's and 70's. Crust was like cardboard. Toppings were worse. What happened to the legacy Don Campitis Pizza ?	0
"You know it's bad when you get in your car practically in tears because of how bad the haircut is. Having curly hair, I've had my fair share of terrible haircuts. The one I had at this salon was among the worst. I explained to the owner of the salon how I wanted my layering, but apparently because I didn't tell him exactly how to cut my hair - since after all, I figured he's the one who should know how to cut hair, including curly hair - it's my fault that I received such a terrible haircut. Sorry, I guess I was too busy watching in horror as he blunt cut horizontal layers into my hair (exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do with curly hair). The owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair. And he's overpriced to boot. The other stylists may give better cuts, but the owner's attitude (\""It's not my fault\"") suggests this salon deserves no one's business."	0
My husband and I have been coming here for the past six years and cannot say enough about the salon.  Prior to finding Geno Como, I could never get the correct looking highlights/lowlights until I found Lisa here (I'm 44!).  My hair has never looked so beautiful and I am so glad that we found such a great place.  Everyone is so friendly and I love coming here as the salon has a light and airy look to it which is very relaxing, yet the prices are very reasonable.  I have recommended more people to this salon and they are also very happy.  You cannot go wrong with Geno Como!!!	1
"Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH, I don't know what else I could have done.. \n\nBefore every haircut I explain that I am very particular about the length of my hair -- I want to keep it long, it grows very slowly, that it is IMPERATIVE to only cut a TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made this extremely clear to the stylist. She promised that she \""wouldn't do anything crazy..\""\n\nLet's just say I am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because I went in for a trim but left with FOUR INCHES missing from my hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them. But either way, what should have been a really quick/easy trim, turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life. It all could have been so easily avoided. It doesn't feel fair. \n\nProceed with caution.."	0
I am not impressed.  The food was so-so and my boyfriend and I had a coupon purchased that morning from restaurants.com and they wouldn't accept it. I bought it that morning, sorry if it should have been taken off the website but you should honor it. I would not pay their full price for it, but with a nice coupon then maybe it could be worth it. The quality of the food was not good enough to outweigh the service.	0
Mediocre  Food  Service and Atmosphere.\nBetter to stay clear and save your money.  \nJudging from the empty tables the luster and joy of the Namaste we remembered is no longer.\n\nWe experienced the following sub par  dishes while dining after 8 pm on a Friday evening in an empty restaurant:\n\nBland reheated Samosas.\nFlavorless Malek Paneer. ( the cheese pcs were quite good despite)  inconsistent  and barely there flavors of certainly fresh frozen spinach mix. \nBarely reheated Naan. \n\nWe traveled to eat at Namaste specifically based on delightful past experience. Obviously that feeling is long gone.  The staff  were content to chat with friends and answer frequent texts and cell phone calls while we ate. \n\nThe loud thump of bass from modern indian music with the  electric din of the TV playing Bollywood extracts might have been a nice distraction in a busy restaurant.  Instead  when added to the ding of texts and cell phone calls the loud background noises detracted rather than added  anything to an already mediocre dining experience.	0
My wife and I have been eating here for many years now. We almost always go for the lunch buffet and have eaten here at least 25-30 times now. The menu items change every time we're here so sometimes we like it better than others and range from really thrilled by the food to feeling it's ok but are never disappointed. The owners/staff are really very nice too and they serve you fresh naan to order. I am writing now after all these years because another Indian restaurant opened a stones throw away and I want to make sure you try Namaste instead. The service and attitude at the other are just this side of rude and indifferent. Yesterday, I had baigan bharta, chana masala, palak paneer, pakora, chicken tandoor, onion naan and masala tea and all were very very good.  I skipped the chicken curry, carrots/peas, rice and tomato soup but thought I would list them to give you an idea of what else they had yesterday.  All for $7.95. I hope you'll stop by and give it a try.	1
Loved the food! The food has a home made feel to it! \n\nYes, the old lady seemed rude. but we did not deal with her.  The cook (guy in apron) was very friendly and kept coming back to us to see if we need anything.	1
I really liked this food. I'm not Indian, but my boyfriend is. He liked it too! \n\nWe stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered from the menu instead of the buffet. We ordered the chili chicken, chicken 65, lamb biryani, Lamb vindaloo, and tadka dal. It was delicious. The chicken 65 wasn't spicy or flavorful enough, but everything else was incredible. We spiced everything at. 7/10. It had a bite, but wasn't too hot. \n\nErythema was freshly made. There were only two other families in the restaurant when we were there, both Indian/Pakistani? \n\nService was slow and grumpy. But it was totally worth it. It's hard to find good Indian food in Pittsburgh. Udipi is ok for pure veg... Corriander is greasy... India gardens dishes all taste the same... \n\nI would return. \n\nPortions were small, but I like that because then you can order more things to taste! Although, prices were relatively high. Every entree was about $12 and were ordered 4. It was worth it regardless.	1
Just to let everyone know, Namaste Indian Restaurant has moved (January 2013) from it's old location in the Banksville Plaza to 1150 Banksville Rd, adjacent to The Days Inn. I've notified Yelp.	1
This was probably one of the worst places I've eaten at in a while . I'm not sure what was worse food or service . Never again , the coupon we bought and weren't allowed to use left on the table	0
"I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words \""thank you\"" and \""how are you\"" are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used, thus my favorite dish, aloo gobi, is never offered..  There sometimes is no rice pudding, and in place of the India staple buffet item, chicken tandoori, the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered.  It is s shame that such a beautiufl, comfortable restaurant space is being wasted.  For a mere $1.01 more, I can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest Indian food in the lovely atmosphere of All India, North Craig Street, Oakland, where I receive gracious, personal attention from the owners."	0
"I wish I could give this place \""-5\"" stars for its terrible food quality. Oily, greasy and bad taste. All 4 members of our party fell sick, throwing up and/or with a running stomach."	0
Shockingly bad.  I know it's Pittsburg so my expectations were low, but there is no call for rudeness.  The old lady should retire.  The young waiter was ok but clearly  scared of the woman.   I went to the dinner buffet at 530 pm, the food was obviously left over from lunch, the rice was so old it was crunchy, all other food was very low quality and mostly cold. I always like to say something nice so the sweet carrot dish was not horrible.  My search for quality Indian food in the 'burgh continues.	0
I cannot believe how anyone can like this place. May be the service was bad the day I went. I walked in .... then found that the place had a smell that was not pleasant. But, I got adjusted to that in a few moments. I found only 4 or 5 items in the buffet. None of them looked fresh. I tried this place only because of the other yelp reviews. I would never go there again.	0
"The hotel has a little listing for Maharaja which includes some pretty specific and weird hours, none of which include Mondays. I called on a Monday to confirm and got a dude saying they close 9ish. I showed up and they have a menu that states pretty simply, 11am - 10pm 7 days a week.. Buffet closes at 9:30.\n\nThey didn't speak about, point to or even half heartedly gesture to the menu. I was immediately pointed to the buffet and told \""have whatever you want\"" or something similar. There were 6 veg options,  4 meats (biryanis and curries), nan, poori and bhajis, kheer and pleasantly hot gulab jamun, average (free, unlimited) lassi, some good chai,  and decent chutneys and lemon pickles.\n\nMeals ends with mukhwa, but the candy and plain fennel seeds are kept in seperate bowls. The emphasis on customer self-reliance here could be construed as bad or lazy service, but I appreciate the lax environment."	1
Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd, and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here, but to each his/her own. I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street.	0
Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!	0
I'm not about reviewing fast food places, but I found out this Arby's was the first in Pittsburgh. It even has the HUGE cowboy hat out front as a marker. \n\nIt has all the stuff you'd expect, Roast Beef sandwiches, and those amazing Jamocha Shakes Arby's is known for.	0
"This is a very typical neighborhood Foodland.  It looks like it hasn't been renovated since the days of the Steelers \""Immaculate Reception\"", but it kind of has a certain well-worn charm.  The place is crowded and cramped too, but not unpleasant.  The parking lot is very small, but as I was taking the \""T\"", it wasn't an issue.   I stopped here last night because I was in the neighborhood attending a meeting at someone's house close by and I volunteered to pick up a treat. \n\nI'd say that this place is worth it for your run-of-the-mill staples and nothing else."	0
It's an IGA now.	0
Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales.	0
One of my favorite hometown pizza places. Try the white pizza, you won't be disappointed. Great place to grab a beer on Beverly road and catch up with old friends.	1
I live in walking distance so I have been here many times . The place is very clean and the menu has many choices ... Not just pizza and hoagies . The bar is well stocked and has many varieties of beer . I would suggest coming here for breakfast or brunch on the weekends . The omlettes are huge . The only drawback is the place very small and can get crowded . You can't have a discussion without hearing what the people sitting at the next table are talking about as well . There is sometimes a wait to get a table . Good place to take the family , a date or just yourself . This place is alot like Vincents of  Green Tree.	1
Meh. At best. So I went to Bado's tonight w/ my dad and sister and it was a bit lackluster. I started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( I know. I know. I am an avid evening bloody mary drinker.) The bloody mary was pretty awesome for what I assume is a pre-made mix. I also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell! Iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers, and dry swordfish. Lame. My dad got a meatball casserole which is something I would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me, let alone as a package deal.  This meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart. \n\nMy sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  She also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average. \n\nI guess pizza is what Bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.  \n\nPro: Spicy bloody marys, decent pizza, cute waiter, wide beer selection\nCon: bland salads, noodleless noodle soups, not many healthy options, no dinner entrees besides pasta,	0
"I really enjoy going to Bado's. We mostly order the Gourmet Bianco Pizza, 4 slice for the two of us, with an appetizer and that is more than enough! We draws us there is the pizza and beer. The pizza is always amazing, and they have a great selection of beers on tap and in bottles. If you want to taste a beer on tap, just ask and they will bring you a little to try. The waitress's working weekends are pretty fantastic. The guys that work during the work are so-so. I don't have any experience with the bartenders, as we always sit at a table and eat.\nThe one drawback for me is how it's a bit \""too\"" family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want. Maybe it's because the environment already seems loud, parents feel they can let their children misbehave and it will go unnoticed. I frequent this restaurant, and this seems to be he case most weekday evenings and weekends."	1
Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff, we got up and walked out. It's a shame too... we liked the looks of the menu and the bar list and specials. Don't think we'd ever come back after that. There are plenty of other places.	0
I went with my boyfriend and one of his coworkers to this joint for lunch last week. As the rating suggests - meh.\n\nIt wasn't terrible and the service was fine. I just feel like I've had much better pizza elsewhere around town. And for sure a better margherita. Theirs fell into the category that I find most end up in: a regular cheese pizza. Quite a few places seem to not understand the differences between the two, and this place was no different.\n\nNow, the cheese/margherita pizza they served me was pretty good, but it didn't stand out for me. The other two ordered sandwiches of some sort that they both really seemed to like. The beer selection was also a bit lacking for my taste, but that may just be because they didn't have anything I liked so I stuck with water (that's me when I go out to eat: alcohol or water ;).	0
I have been a patron of Bado's several times now, and this is a great spot to have few beers, watch a game, and meet up with friends.  Their beer selection is commendable and is frequently updated.  I have sat a the bar and had a table.  I've never had a problem with service.  Staff is knowledgeable and makes great suggestions.  \nNow for the food...their pizza is so yummy!  I love everything about it. The cheese, sauce, toppings...all great.  Their wings are also good.  \nIt can get quite packed during a game or on a weekend evening, so there can be a wait.  Grab a beer and wait b/c it's worth it.	1
pricey, pricey pricey and it isnt that good!	0
I just want to like it due to its location and great beer selection, but the food is awful.	0
Love Bado's. Any pizza is really good and their rueben is very tasty. Lots of beer choices and they give out free samples.	1
one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. \n\ni would never eat here again	0
We just ate there on a Friday night and the whole experience was a disaster. Rude, unfriendly, just a miserable male server. Drinks were lousy , service was lousy, food just o.k., nothing to write home about, and at 9:00 on a Friday night they were putting chairs on the tables and vacuuming, hinting it was time for us to leave. The whole experince was horrible... and the bill was outrageous.  Save your money and Go somewhere else!!!!	0
The service is a little off and the staff doesn't seem very attentive to your needs. However the food is worth having bad service. They have a great selection of pizzas but my personal favorite is the buffalo chicken.	1
Delicious pizza. Amazing beer selection. We don't live anywhere close to this place, and will drive 45+ minutes for their food and ambience. Whenever I have family visiting, and we have the time, we trek over for a delicious dinner at Bado's. Be sure to check out their chalkboard with the drink and food specials!\n\nWe've never had any problems with the service or the food, and will definitely be back!	1
I always get burgers and beer here even though they're known for their pizza. No regrets! Love their growlers too!	1
"I will never go back. Besides the gnocchi coming from a vacuum sealed bag, they offer a \"" Pittsburgh Sandwich \"" they don't know how to make. Served fries on the side and bagged coleslaw. Fries were an afterthought due to the pickle found underneath.  watched a young waiter spill two drinks, or e on a customer.  Same waiter after avoiding a table with cash payment, waiting for them to leave so he could pocket the change, finally got them change, as soon as they left he pulled out his wallet and put the tip inside.So unprofessional. Food from a box and under trained staff. Not if they begged would I go back."	0
An impromptu party/picnic in the yard.   Lots of kids and friends stopped by to see an old neighbor that was in town visiting.  All of a sudden, it was time to eat.  Little Nipper's to the rescue.   Ordered a few different style pizza's and some wings.  Nice crust not thin but not to thick, the sauce is tasty, cheese was nice... gummy, stringy, good.  The pizza's disappeared fast.  The wings were good and a little crunchy, just right.	1
best pizza on beverly rd	1
Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too.	0
"Got into Pittsburgh late this evening and this was the only place around that was still open and delivered after 11 pm. I give them a half star for this. \n\nThey have a few vegetarian choices on the menu. I give them another half star for this. I ordered what I thought would have the most vegetables, the \""vegetable calzone.\"" \n\nThey ended up delivering a \""Mediterranean calzone,\"" which was also vegetarian, but it wasn't what I ordered. The small portion of vegetables was tasty and most of them seemed fresh, so I give them another half star for this. I didn't bother to ask if anything was organic.\n\nThey told me it would be about a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being closer to 30 and the delivery guy was friendly. I give them another half star for under-promising and over-delivering. \n\nThis place might be great for people who love fresh made bread and lots of cheese, but it's not a vegan delight!"	0
I don't like this place at all. The staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business. A couple years ago I had heard they smoke over making their pizza. All of their employees tend to be shady. I don't recommend at all.	0
I used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business.  However with the last experience I will have to rethink that. My aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday. When it was delivered it looked beautiful.  However once opened not so much.  Inside it was filled with....Dollar General brand goods. When I stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect. If it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip. So moral of the tale. If you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the Dollar Store you know where to go. To make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care.	0
I wish there were negative stars I could put for this place.  One of the most unprofessional experiences I have ever had with a business owner, not even a worker.  I was yelled at, mocked, and generally treated like crap for checking up on a remounting job that was supposed to be done within a week.  Emotional mess the rest of the day.  I have never been treated that way with any owner of a business.   I work with restaurant owners for god's sake!   Unbelievable.   If you want the full story, email me and I will tell you the whole thing.  As it is right now, DO NOT patronize this business.   There was absolutely no excuse for his attitude.	0
I guess that I sport a very simple haircut and like to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the person who cut my hair here must have slipped with the razor just behind my ear and tried to make it look normal by cleaning it up and making the other side look the same. Since I don't typically look at myself for extended periods of time, I actually didn't notice until last night when I was washing my hands in a resteraunt bathroom.  I will be speaking with manager come Monday. \n\nI had no wait and the lady who can't cut my simple hair do was very nice, until she didn't say oops I sort of f*'d your hair up. It isn't really bad and I'm not horribly upset but it IS noticeable! It would have been nice if she said something to me about it. I think this warrants a refund of my money. I will let you all know if I got my money back.	0
Don't buy those old pre-made arrangements from the grocery store or the overpriced stingy bunch of flowers from other places.  Come here- the service is great and the price is very reasonable.  \n\nWithout realizing it, we walked in 5 minutes before closing time.  Regardless, the owner greeted us warmly and said she would be happy to help us.  I told her I didn't know anything about flowers, so she asked for a price range and the proceeded to select and arrange a fresh bouquet.  Even though it was the end of the day, the flowers were still perky and the arrangement was spectacular.  Couldn't have been happier and will recommend it to everyone I know.	1
An abomination....the billing department is run by a level of incompetence of which the likes have never been seen.  Ever get a bill 2 yrs late, then pay over the phone with a credit card, only to have the payment never recorded and then receive harassing phone calls?  Well I just did....	0
Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.  I went to American Express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges.  Even after that, I was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened.  I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general.	0
If I could leave ADT Security a negative review I would.  This is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned.  I work for a General Contractor on the West Coast and we use ADT for our clients.  Security patrol is standard, but the problem is that their invoices are obscure to the point of insensible, referencing 3 other invoices that were never received.  The only way that you can view the invoices is to login to their website with a password no one has, from a letter that is only mailed out the jobsite.  I AM NOT AT THE JOBSITE WHERE CONSTRUCTION IS DONE, I am in the business office where we pay bills.  Their CSRs put you on hold for 10-15 minutes at a time only to tell you lies about what they can do, then you have to call back and deal with them all over again when the lies are uncovered.  They are the worst company, do yourself a favor and stay away from them.	0
"The service is not that amazing, it's almost as if they don't care to have a business. I've dealt with them for large orders and while meeting the deadlines they request, it's never enough. They usually don't have your requested kegs and will tell you to order earlier (which by experience still does not help). \n\nThe saving grace is likely for individual sales. From the times I've had go to the store to pick up our \""deliveries\"" (ie. nearly every time), it looked like they had a decent selection from the wall for cases...but who knows if they actually carry the selection."	0
Come here instead of D's if you need to buy cases of beer. They're cheaper than D's and everything is easy to find. Thanks to the peeps at D's for the referral.	1
This place was great! I was a little bit let down by the Chicago hot dog as it had too much mustard. That said, however, I was really excited by the beer selection and the neon green relish. If you're looking for a chill meal, this is a great place to check out!	1
This is a great place to go if you're in the 'burgh. This small joint expanded in the last year. great dogs and a huge selection of beer, imported and otherwise. Service has always been decent and better. Sports agames are often on the TV so get ready for that. Atmosphere is pretty neat- there's a weird mural in the larger seating area that's worth a peek and a air duct in top of the room that's cleverly painted like a wooden beam- can't get over that. I am a fan. Go here- then go catch a movie at Regent Square theater up the street.	1
Frosty drafts, the best veggie dog I've ever tasted, and delicious whole wheat-crust pizza.  Thankfully, since their beer selection is vast and ranges from relatively cheap to ridiculous, the food is generally well-priced.  Toning it down on the drinks can easily bring your bill down to a manageable twenty bucks for two people.  They get a little extra bump from me because they so graciously hosted the Pittsburgh Beer Society for a long time, AND gave PBS members 10% off their beers.  The downside?  Service can be spastic, and I've never seen each person at a table get each of their meals at the same time.  One person can scarf down two (delicious) Chicago dogs long before their partner receives their (equally delicious) calzone.  \n\nBut Omar, hipsters and yuppies?  Aside from the occasional pair of skinny jeans and a trucker cap or two, I've seen mostly families taking advantage of D's great prices and groups of friends chatting and sharing drinks.  It's definitely not a place to go to see and be seen, which suits me just fine.	1
One of the few reasons I may miss Pittsburgh when I go to grad school. The hot dogs are piled on high with the best, fattiest stuff I can muster up, and the beer selection is one of the best in Allegheny Co. Great for a night out with friends, followed by indie movies at the Regent Square Theatre across the street.	1
In my final meal in Pittsburgh, I finally had the closest thing to a Pittsburgh sandwich and that was the Big Ben Hot Dog with cole slaw, fries, and a cheese sauce. It oddly worked and I enjoyed the meal before I had to hit the road. The fries our table shared was also a winner as they were crispy and uniformly cut and fluffy potato goodness in the middle. Definitely a great cheap eats spot.	1
D's is the 'it' place for Pittsburgh... especially for those that like beer. There are several Belgian pubs around Pittsburgh, but D's is a whole different experience. \n\nYes, the cave is like a candy shop. The cave is located in the back of the left side. The first time I went (after reading Yelp reviews) I was a little intimidated to head straight past the bar. It's not like BevMo so don't expect to save a lot on a six pack but if you're interested in sampling and trying out different craft or imported beer it's the place. Plus, who can resist a cheap, filling hot dog?\n\nHm.. hungry. I'm going there now.	1
I came here with a bunch of Russian language students who go to the University of Pittsburgh, figuring locals and Russian speakers would know the best bars.  I was not wrong.\n\nThis place is absolutely awesome, with an impressive beer selection and great prices.  The staff is spot on with suggestions and somehow able to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once.  At happy hour, I had incredible Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad.  \n\nFor the upscale beer they serve, the place isn't trendy or yuppie.  You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft (it changes often).  They even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them. \n\nThe music is good, and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  Highest endorsement.\n\nTo Rob, ogromnoye spaceba!	1
great beer selection and good dogz.	1

"good selection of beers*, but the food is appalling. sysco-truk curly fries and run-of-the-mill hotdogs that don't even have natural casings. puh-leez. if you're gonna put \""dogz\"" in the name of your restaurant at least try to serve something better than what you can get on sale at giant eagle. \n\nno joke: I prefer the O. their fries are made out of potatoes and their dogs have real casings. \n\n* and by \""good\"" I mean \""good for PA\"" where liquor laws are an absurd kafkaesque mess and a lindeman's geuze is about as interesting as it gets (for like $15, natch)"	0
"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. They serve \""bar food\"", but there's a nice variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. My favorite items on the menu are the veggie dogs, pizza, and soft pretzels. \n\nYou can't beat their beer selection. Make sure to visit the beer cave while you are there and their section of take-out beer for an even larger selection."	1
First stop on my Midwest Brew Crawl with the BF! \nThe BF ate here once last year and loved it so much that we decided that we needed to make it our first stop on our road trip to Minnesota. We planned our departure time so that we could get here at lunch (it was a mere 7 hour drive!) \nWe both ordered the Bacon Cheese all beef dog (hot dog with bacon and melted cheddar on top) plus a corn dog, dusted wings and two root beers. We didn't try any of the beers on tap since we still had a lot of driving ahead of us. The Bacon Cheese was ridiculously good and I wished that I could have finished it. Unfortunately I hogged pretty much all of the corn dog since it was AMAZING!!!  The wings were also really good, maybe even among the top three chicken wings that we had the whole trip.\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the Pittsburgh area or anyone who is crazy enough to drive 7 hours for a hot dog.	1
I'm over it. \n\nToo many instances of bad service. Though that one woman who I have seen working there for a long time is solid. But going back to what I started with; seems like the inmates are running the prison these days. \n\nThe beer to-go costs more here than it does in New York City or Brooklyn. Think about that people.\n\n(The Monroeville location is better, imo.)	0
Draft Belgian beer and a Mason Dixon dog.	1
Enter into D's (after figuring out the correct door - I still make this mistake) and you'll be greeted by a long draft bar. For Chrissakes, they have Delirium on tap! The real jewel, though, is in the back. You have the beer cave with hundreds of different types of cold beers for carry out, or you can build your own six pack from the unchilled beers and chill them on the spot. D's is still the only place I've ever found the elusive Hopfenweisen by SchneiderWeiss and Brooklyn Brewery, perhaps the best beer I've ever had.\n\nWhile D's is worth it for the beer alone, the food's not bad either. The pizza is average, but they truly do have the best hot dogs in the city.\n\nFinally, bring a growler or buy one of theirs. Prices are reasonable and the selection is outstanding.	1
Beer cave!!	1
"Obviously the great rep of this place is their beer selection.  A lot of bottles.  Decent tap selection, though you are guaranteed to have a rather lopsided selection among the taps.\n\nFood is fair; I've yet to go there with others and have our whole meal come out at once.  Salad will come first, then a couple of dogs, then fries.  If you are polite and civil and believe in not eating until everyone is served, well, let's just say that no one ever taught the manager, cooks or servers here that lesson.\n\nNow, their service:  Really lackluster.  \""Entitled\"" is the word I would use.  It pains me to give them 15%, because honestly, they don't earn it, even when I was a regular and knew some of them by name. Meh."	0
Everyone is so nice, tons of different beers to choose from, including a mix your own 6 pack deal and, just 3 words, Mason Dixon Dog!	1
D's is a fantastic place with food! Reasonably priced and a nice atmosphere! Can get crowded but that's because it's soooo good! I love the selection of beer, it always me to try out a new beer without having to buy a whole case!	1
I am not huge on hot dogs or beer. However, I am huge on add-ons. This is where D's comes in. I totally recommend the chihuahua hot dog. It has avocado!!! The wings are delish too. This place is a must go for beer lovers. I am still the light and sweet kinda beer person, so I tried something with raspberry notes in it, and LOVED it! Oh and the fries are awe-frickin-some!! My second fave in the city after Point Brugge.	1
Crowded bar atmosphere, spectacular beer selection, good bar food.  Great hot dogs.	1
we love to go to this place when we are in visiting the in-laws. it's a great place to meet up with old friends, order greasy food, drink craft beer, and catch up in a relaxed setting. The place can get kind of loud at night so make sure your group of friends aren't hard of hearing. The craft beer selection is excellent. You can make your own six pack to go or drink any one of the unique beers in-house. They also have beers on tap for a cheap price. Food wise, their wings are decent and the pizza is greasy and cheesy. The place is pretty bare bones 'burgh style. Not trying to be something it's not, but still offering unique, quality beer from around the world. For that I give it my fandome and return business.	1
"It was either Mother Theresa or the Baha Men who said \""Who let the dogs out?\"" and I must say, I was glad someone let my bacon cheddar dog out of the kitchen and into my stomach.  Dee-licious!\n\nStopped in here before seeing a movie at the Regent Square Theater for some beers, dogs and chili cheese fries.  I had two IPAs that were good and reasonably priced.  I couldn't finish the fries so I took them with me to the movie theater and the lady didn't mind that I brought them in.  I finished them fairly quickly once the movie started (I was seeing the Swedish version of \""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"" so this was a while ago.)\n\nAlso, since I was just visiting town, I didn't have a car and I rode the bus there all the way by myself!\n\nSo the point is, you can eat here and get a great dog and good beer, and you can also take the bus here and then see a movie."	1
Yum! I think Ive been here three times since moving to PGH, \n\nFav dogs: Chihuahua , Brat, and Chicago style dog. Never tried other entrees but their fries are nice and crispy. \n\nThey have plenty of Belgian beers to choose from a bonus in my beer book.\n\nBeers: usually a good variety on tap plus tons of variety if you need to one stop shop and pick some six packs up in the back. \n\nWarning though if it is a busy summer evening you can wait up to one hour for your dog I think this is because they have tiny kitchen behind the bar. So if you're super hungry go early or later or fill up on their beer first. \n\nAlso this doesn't really bother me i still ate my food but the guy cooking the food didn't wear gloves and did touch the food with his bare hands often. If you're OCD maybe just get a beer or don't sit at the bar where you can see this. Don't worry he didn't pick anything up off the floor and put it back on plates, i checked. :)	1
This place is like my second home. Not just because of the beer. Not just because of the great food - like hot dogs, pizza, burgers, salads.  But, because I just love the atmosphere there. The staff is awesome. The people who eat/drink there are always there to just have a good time while enjoying having a few great beers.\nI recommend this place for anyone that just wants a beer, anyone who loves hot dogs, etc.  Their pizza is actually REALLY good.\n\nOh, and they have gluten free beers, which is good since I don't eat/drink anything with gluten in it!	1
This is paradise for beer connoisseurs. A range of beer that confuses, bedazzles and quenches you thirst for quality brews. The selection on lager and ales on tap as well as in the 'beer cave' make this place one of a kind. The special hummus, fries, hot dogz, and pizza make it the perfect hangout place any given day in Pittsburgh	1
The mac n cheese dog I had was just ok, but the Mason Dixon with its slaw and chili was killer. The fries and barbeque wings were just as good. I also liked the atmosphere, the mural, and the employees who were really nice and honest and helpful. It's in a cool neighborhood too. Go!	1
D's is a great dive bar in Regent Square.  I had a Chicago-style dog with bacon, and fries to go, for around $6.  The dog looked like a chef put some real love into it - it was picture perfect, lightly dusted with celery salt, relish tucked in like it was ready for a commercial.  The taste was perfect!  The fries were awesome - batter-dipped, super hot, crispy and just salty enough to not need extra.  I'll definitely be back.  Not a lot of joints know how to do a good Chicago dog.  Good cheap eats.	1
I love this place. My fiance and I moved to the Regent Square area in May and we've been to D's multiple times in the three or so months since. The food is good--fairly typical bar fare--but it's the beer that keeps bringing us back. Their selection is huge (see: beer cave) and I've had some amazing beers that I didn't know even existed. The employees really know their stuff and will help you pick a beer if you don't know what you want. My fiancee is not a huge beer fan but the bartenders/waitstaff have been successful in finding him something he likes. They also have at least three gluten-free beers for those with gluten sensitivities. The atmosphere is not too loud or crazy and is a nice place to go if you want to be able to hear your companions.\n\nThe sad part is that D's closes fairly early--the bar closes at 11 on Sunday-Wednesday and midnight on Thursday-Saturday. The kitchen closes an hour before the bar.	1
Chicago dog was awesome. Great selection of craft beers on draft too!	1
I don't come here to eat much, I usually come for the beer cave. Best build-your-own six pack joint in the city!	1
I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.\n\nThe first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order, a kitchen guy ran it out, and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well, you can't say I didn't try.\n\n I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad, but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place.	0
Hot dogs were delicious and fun to mix and match toppings. They do fried dogs too and it's great. Beer selection is obviously fantastic. Check our their beer cave!	1
D'z dogs is the best. All the employees seem to want to be here. Nothing is better then when your food provider is excited about what he/she is doing. Come try a scorpion dog.!!!!	1
Went here after a run in nearby Frick Park, which I felt gave me license to have a (delicious) hot dog washed down with a few great beers. I can't wait to return!	1
Last night was my first time at D's. The beer cave was amazing! I'm not a fan of beer but can appreciate a vast selection. I went straight for the cider. The lively energy of this place was incontestable. No frills, down-to-earth place where you can kick it back with a beer (or in my case a cider) and enjoy company with friends. It was a perfect ending to our movie night at the Regent Square Theater. With smiles planted on our faces after watching a dark comedy, going to D's only extended our happy mood. Before leaving I went back to the beer cave for more cider. Good stuff, good stuff!	1
Was at D's this afternoon! I was so excited to find real vienna Hot Dogs in Pittsburgh since I am a born and raised Chicago guy. They were good dogs, had mine Chicago Style of course! Not sure it was Pollmans Mustard. It the buns had poppy seeds! A great place with plenty of atmosphere!	1
Wonderful place for a great casual meal! Their Beer Cave and excellent make your own 6-pack/draft beer selection are well known. As someone who was not able to drink I was equally impressed by their delicious rootbeer also on draft. We had the Vegetarian Pub Fries to start, which was a large helping of french fries smothered in cheese and avocado with a side of ranch. I had the Chihuahua hot dog with a veggie hot dog and added grilled onions and my partner had a specialty Octoberfest hot dog. Both were large and delicious. We did not have to wait long for a Friday night and the service was excellent. The space tends to be crowded so this is not the place to go for a quiet fancy dinner, but the food and drinks were excellent and we will definitely be back.	1
My favorite place in regent square.  you haven't experienced pittsburgh until you've had a hot dog and a beer at d's.if you go on thursday nights the typically have a different brewery featured where they'll have 5 or 6 of their beers on tap	1
D's is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. It's nice to have an easy, fun, casual place to get some good eats and a nice beer. As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat, I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November, with corn, mashed potatoes, cranberry, and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November. \n\nTheir beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room. \n\nSince we like to bring our toddler to dine with us, I'm always so happy that they are so friendly and accommodating with kids. He loves their mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I think he likes their crayons more.\n\nFor a fun family dinner, a good beer, watching a game, getting together with friends, or just experimenting with a new Belgian brew, I strongly recommend D's.	1
Best fries around and a really good beer selection.  A little bit of a drive for us, but we always find a reason to go.  The staff is beyond friendly	1
I absolutely loved this place. First off, I love Regent Square. It's the cutest place, and this is the perfect place for a night out or even to get beer for a night in. My boyfriend is obsessed with the create your own six pack from the beer cave. We ate here on a friday and the place was packed but we got sat right away and our food came out fast. Amazing specialty hummus of the day ( i think it was chipotle ranch) and great sandwiches. The portions are huge and you won't leave hungry.	1
I agree with others that the beer cave is wonderful.  I could stay in there for hours!  The pizza ain't bad either!	1
I was pleased that Candalina Bide ordered my gown as a rush and it did arrive in time for the wedding.  The downside:  the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done.  The hem looked as if a high student just learning to sew had done it and I had to make some repairs and press the hem once I got it home.  The alterations to the bodicve were incomplete and i ended up with a poor fit and lots of excess materialright across the bust.  I would order from them again, but definitely take my dress to a professional seamstress.	0
Worst dry cleaners EVER.  \n\nNot only do they do an incredibly poor job on the clothes, but the staff are particularly nasty and rude.  The kids who work there are fine, but the older ladies are just plain miserable.  I would rather spend more money someplace else than go back to this hell hole.	0
I only got a tear in my sweater sewn together, but my experience was far from pleasant, even expecting nothing special when I walked into the place.  \n\nI went to the dry cleaner out of convenience as I live right in Regent Square.  I took my sweater to the dry cleaner on 2/19/2013 for a tear in the seem, and they told me it would not be available for pickup on 2/25/2013 after 5:00PM.... almost a week later.  What? \n\nAlso, the staff was fairly rude and all had chips on their shoulders.  I'm not entirely sure how their cleaning/sewing process works, but it's slow as molasses and I don't have time for that.  Their lack of urgency coupled with their lack of customer service or even cracking a smile means I will never go back to this dry cleaner.	0
I just moved to the neighborhood and needed to find a dry cleaner close by. Regency Cleaners is fine for dry cleaning but do not entrust any tailoring or hemming to this place! I had the sleeves of my coat hemmed and the tailor (or whoever) did a shitty job (THANKS).\n\nThe owner (larger woman) is rude and dismissive of my questions.\n\nI won't be coming here again.	0
There's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place. Maybe it's that spending thirty minutes in the main bar area will make you spontaneously asphyxiate.  They seriously need to invest in an air purifier.  The bar itself is a huge space, though very few will ever make it into the back room.  It's essentially a dead zone.  There's a fancy back bar that remains closed so that two bartenders can roost on top of each other like Master/Blaster in Beyond Thunderdome and watch TV.  This kind of forces patrons to hover near the front.  So, uh, invest in a second TV, a nice coat of paint, maybe some dimmer light bulbs.  You know, gussy yourself up a bit Murphy's.  It will make you feel more confident.  Who doesn't want a new coat of paint? Huh? HUH? The reason that this place is a two, is that it has an unbelievable amount of potential that's just squandered.	0
I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder.  My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc.  She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area.  They refuse to put in the ramp.  I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship.  Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!  SHAME ON YOU CATHY!	0
I was referred to Edgewood Dental Associates by a friend (who happens to be a doctor). My experience was so positive I feel compelled to pass on this great find. The staff is professional and friendly - they looked up what my insurance covered before I sat down.  They keep digital records (vs. old skewl film x-rays) and you can book your appointment online and do your paperwork in advance.  The office is clean and up-to-date. Plus, the reception area has nice amenities - espresso, current magazines etc.\nhttp://www.edgewooddentalassociates.com/	1
"Best dentist ever!!\n\nI had a stretch of maybe five years where I didn't go to the dentist at all. I was pretty anxious about going since it had been quite some time. My first time going to Edgewood Dental, everyone was really nice, respectful, and professional. No one criticized me or made me feel bad that I hadn't gone for awhile. The staff is also very knowledgeable and very open to any questions you have or anything you'd like to discuss with them.\n\nI now have been going twice a year, and it's pleasant experience (never thought I'd say that about the dentist!).  The office is very nice, clean, and modern. There are many nice \""extras\"" such as free beverages (water, etc) in the lobby and I was even offered an iPod to listen to music when I had a filling done. They also have very flexible hours - open pretty early as well as late some evenings.\n\nI will most definitely keep going to Edgewood  Dental as long as I live in this area."	1
This is a charming little place overshadowed by D'z Dogs (which is amazing as well) but we're not always in the mood for hot dogs and french fries. Dunnigan's provides an adequate bar with daily specials. The menu is an upgrade from your typical bar/grill. Of course the star item on the menu would have to be the French Onion soup which boasts rich broth soaked up by a thick slice of chewy bread that holds up well and plentiful caramelized onions all smothered by gooey cheese broiled until bubbling to golden perfection. Mmmm.....\n\nThe restaurant is roomy and comfortable. Perfect for a nice night out with your sweetheart.	1
Average food, slightly above average prices for the quality/taste, average price for the location, lack-luster service.\n\nThis place (the location, the actual building itself, etc.) could be so much more.  I wish they would either step it up, or sell the business to someone that would let it achieve its true potential.\n\nUntil then, there are other dining options in Regent Square and they should be explored.	0
I love Dunning's.  When I want a good burger, this is the place I visit.  Even when they're busy, I can count on getting my burger the way I ordered it.  The portions are HUGE.  The downside is that this place can be noisy and the wine prices are too high for a 4 ounce pour.  Otherwise, the service is good, the food consistent, and the atmosphere pleasant for a neighborhood pub.	1
I really wanted to like this place, because it sounds like it used to be really popular. We heard the burgers were very good once upon a time, so we tried them, but they were just ok. Nice people though, and plenty of seating. Good place to watch the game probably (bar).	0
Friendly and prompt service.  The French onion soup is great. The prices are a bit more than what one should pay for standard fare. Otherwise great place.	1
I am updating my review of the Oakmont store after my last experience consigning there. The store employee happily accepted all of my items- until the next day when I received a call that the owner rejected half of the items. This was the third time I consigned with Ambiance in Oakmont, and I only offered items that I thought were in excellent condition from high end retailers; even though I have seen brands in the store from Charter Club for example (Ambiance says they do not accept them in the consigning agreement). The employee was very apologetic and she said that she stood by her assessment that the items were of good quality, but the owner (who she seemed upset with) disagreed. So, get your stuff together Ambiance owner and either train your employees better, or only accept items yourself so that you do not inconvenience potential customers like me. Surprisingly, I did not receive the same return on this set of consigned items; not sure if that is coincidence or not.	0
The drive through service here leaves something to be desired.  Not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy.	0
This place continues to be a joke.  The service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse.  \n\nMy order is never right and yet I still go...never again.  \n\nI officially deem this place the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh.	0
Worst service.  Dirty.  Slow.  Ignorant by the strictest definition.  Do not go here.  Bad!  Real bad.	0
"While the shop is in a pretty great location, with cute decor, they only accept cash (which is annoying), and the friendliness of the staff varies significantly, from awesome to terrible. I could deal with either--and have, given my love of coffee shops--but I guess I need consistency. I want to know what to expect, you know?\n\nTheir coffee is pretty good--not awesome, but certainly drinkable. Their pastries vary a bit, as well; that they offer carrot cake cupcakes is pretty cool, but I think something's wrong with their fridge, making things stale half the time.\n\nKind of meh.\n\n(Note on \""outdoor seating:\"" It's really no good unless you smoke, because there's one employee who spends half the day out there, smoking.)"	0
The place smells awful.   Its non-smoking, but reeks of stale smoke, and when I spend 1/2 an hour there, I leave smelling like smoke.  This isn't an isolated incident, but it really smells every time I've been in there (at least once a month for the past couple years).\n\non the up side: decent coffee, decent assorted snacks (pastries, sandwiches, etc.), great location.	0
I really want to see small coffee shops succeed, I do. Regent Square is full of small businesses and the community is really supportive. I believe this and the lack of coffee chains is the only reason they are still open. They are cash only, but so is half of all the other businesses on that street, so I don't hold it against them. \n\nIt's dingy. They don't use their space well. Coffee is brewed in poured into an regular old coffee pump pot. The desserts looked good, but there was one lonely cookie and two cupcakes (granted it was Saturday night). It just looked really sparse.	0
This is a depressing coffee shop. I went in on a wednesday afternoon to find the place dim, muggy, eerily silent (as in no music or talk, just shuffling noises), and filled with a sense of sadness.  I tried to sit down and enjoy some coffee, which was drinkable, but I couldn't get over the odd atmosphere, that is until the music started, so quiet I couldn't even tell you what it was, just that it was on. I'm giving it two stars for the awesome alternative energy posters hanging on the far wall.	0
Regent Square is a nice little area, and it certainly deserves a better coffee shop than Katerbean.\n\nWe just moved to Pittsburgh in July, and before we got the interwebs in our home, we would frequent Katerbean fairly regularly, at least 2 to 3 times per week in order to use their free wi-fi and have a drink.  Every time... EVERY TIME we went there, we left reeking of smoke.  There's no smoking inside, of course, but it always happened.  Maybe it's due to poor ventilation, or the fact that the employees were regularly outside smoking, but we always left smelling like we were in a bar.\n\nThen, the tables were usually dirty.  When we would order our drink, we would usually have to get ourselves a napkin, wet it, and wipe our table ourselves. Not surprising, as most of the employees I've encountered there (with the exception of the very nice older woman) seemed pretty put out when I asked for anything.\n\nIn any case, we have internet access at home now, and haven't been back to Katerbean since. I guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it.	0
Ughhhh, Katerbean is the abusive boyfriend that I keep coming back to and hate myself for it. There is nothing else around and convenience wins today due to the snow, and my extreme exhaustion and need for caffiene.\n\nWhy, do you ask? I just asked the gal behind the counter, kindly, if I could borrow a pen for a moment. I got an annoyed sigh, an eye roll  and zero eyecontact. Really? I asked for a pen, not a kidney. \n\nMy pleading for a coffee shop intervention from someone, anyone, is now a red alert! Help us RS residents, please!	0
Yeah, I'm not coming here anymore.\n\n1) They charge extra for whipped cream.\n2) They use canned whipped cream. If you're gonna charge me for whipped cream you damn well better make your own fresh whipped cream. Jeez.\n3) My hot chocolate was just gross. Like they use Hershey's chocolate syrup or something. Yuck.\n4) I saw how they keep their filters prefilled with ground coffee just sitting out on the counter to get stale! WTF?\n\nSigh. I hope the people at Biddle's Revenge open that place up soon and know WTF they are doing...	0
"Is it possible to give zero stars?  If so, Katerbean would rate a zero.\n\nBad atmosphere, unfriendly employees, slow and reluctant service, pump your own coffee, dingy interior, dirty tables.  If they only had telescreens which couldn't be switched off, then this place would be a perfect setting to film Orwell's \""1984\""."	0
Cigarette smoke and ashtray smells combined with mediocre coffee and subpar customer service are not my cup of tea, and I never even rank the tea here. Thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that Biddle's Escape opened and now I have absolutely no reason to go to Katerbean.	0
This place is now closed :-). Best thing that could've been done with it.  Going to opn in a couple of months under new management as the 61B caf\u00e9. I look forward to seeing what some new life does to this place!	0
Long story short - I lost the heel of my favorite pair of well-worn boots - a decade-old pair of Coach leather riding boots that were in otherwise excellent condition. I brought them in tears to Edgewood Shoe Repair thinking they could never be fixed and it would be like losing an old friend. Two days and seven bucks (SEVEN BUCKS !!!) I had them back in absolutely perfect condition, and with a free shine thrown in ! They looked as good as the day I bought them. I honestly can't tell that it had any work done on it at all - the friendly, welcoming shoemaker's skill is THAT good ! I'm now going through my closet looking for other shoes that I thought were goners as I just know this magical man can bring them back to life as well. Can I give more than five stars ? Truly a hidden gem in Edgewood...	1
"Recently realized that I have been a customer of Rudy's for 40 years. When I was a kid we got Sicilian-style pizza from his previous location on Washington St. in Swissvale. Then when they moved and became a sub shop I got hooked on those wonderful cheesesteaks. Now I live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fix.\n\nNow to be clear, this is probably not a place your typical Yelper would like. There is no ambiance. No \""decor\"". No table service. No boutique brands of soda. Nothing on the menu is \""infused\"". You'll probably want to get your sandwich to go.\n\nBut if you want a delicious cheesesteak, I don't know why you would want to go anywhere else. \n\nThe two best hoagie places in the area are less than a half-mile apart on the same street  - Rudy's and the Triangle bar."	1
I think triangle hoagies are great for parties and tailgates.  I normally order one or two battleships and all the fixings.  They are huge, they are reasonably prices, they are prepared quickly, and they are delicious!  I definitely will be back for more soon!	1
I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years.  They have the BEST subs ever. \n\nBUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town.  They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction.  The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them.  That $2.50 came out of their tip, they can hit up their boss for the rest.  Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards.  Shame on them.	0
I'll make this short and sweet.  I grew up in the Pittsburgh area and now have retired at the central California Coast. I have tried hoagies throughout the United States and the hoagies made at the Triangle Bar in Swissvale are BY FAR the absolute best hoagies in the United States of America!!!!  When I go back and visit Pittsburgh, the Triangle Bar is a MUST stop and I usually buy a couple of extra hoagies so that I can bring them home on the plane to California and enjoy them here!!!\n\nThe Best of the Best!!!!!!!!!!!	1
I love hoagies, and this place has some of the best I've ever had!\n\nSaw them on a Rick Sebak doc and of course had to check it out. Totally lives up to the hype. A true gem in Swissvale.	1
Growing up in Swissvale, we got a battleship for every football game, birthday party, and so on.. now in my late 20's my mom and I still have a ritual of going out to shop and then to each grab a battleship for dinner at our separate homes at least once a month. In over 20 years I can not think of a single bad experience with the place, other than the long wait which I will forgive because it's totally worth it.	1
Great place for lunch. Excellent subs on amazing bread. Fresh, fast and healthy! \n\nBetter than any chain sub shop. \n\nHad the 6 inch torpedo. The battleship is huge!!!!!!! \n\nThey have an ATM inside and only take cash.	1
Amazing! I prefer it over Vincent's, as long as it's veltre's in swissvale! and it's amazing!	1
Pizza was fine but nothing special. The salad I ordered was wrong, though. And beware of the prices: What's on the website is wrong. And the manager and owner will say there's nothing they can do about that (except charge you the higher price that isn't on the website).	0
This is the closest grocery store to me, and I go out of my way to avoid it.  Finding a parking spot is horrible with stop signs everywhere right in front of the main entrance to the store.\n\nEverything is all out of place and it's hard to make a connection as to where a product might be located in the store.  Mind you there are in the middle of a remodel, so I may come back and make and addendum to my review at a later date after the dust settles.  \n\nAs prices go, they are the norm for the Pittsburgh area.  Variety, yeah, they got that covered.  Tidiness, they are working on that.	0
This store is so gross that I was almost sick! Onions peeled and half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I will NEVER step foot in this place again.	0
With the recent update at this location it is much easier to navigate the store.  It's nicer, bigger and has a better selection of ready made foods.  It's amazing how a remodel can make an establishment a much better place to shop.\n\nStill putting on a few finishing touches here and there, but I might actually stop in more frequently to pick up something quick to eat at the ready made counters.  It'll make it easier when I'm running late after the gym to just pick it up and go from here.\n\nParking lot is still a mess, but will hardly ever change.\n\nOh, watch out too, they have applied for a liqueur license to be able to sell six packs with their addiction of a cafe...smart move Giant Eagle.  Not very many places in the Swissvale/Edgwood area to go pick up a quick brew.	1
I really don't get Giant Eagle. They are nice enough, but pricing just makes no sense at all to me. It is close to my house so I'll drop in to buy a thing or two, but would rather go just about anywhere else for my weekly shopping trip.	0
I love that most of their employees make it known that they would rather be anywhere else but here. \nThe prices are higher than most other competitors but it's the closest store to us so it's easy to get to.	0
One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food.	0
Please clean your floor properly.  It feels like Crisco under your feet.  Very dangerous.	0
Nothing special, it is Kmart after all.  \n\nDeals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  I can relate, I did my time in retail.  Although I left it when my time was due.  \n\nGood for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area.	0
Wow. I hope that the one experience I had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers. All I wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks (which they didn't even have any for men!  ???). I just ended up grabbing the next best thing (Oddly, they did have thermal socks for women which I almost purchased). I go stand in the check out line, and I don't think I've ever dealt with slower people than those who work here (and that's saying something). Not one, but two of the registers I stood in line at froze, and the women had to wait for the manager to fix.  They didn't seem to mind at all, which leads me to believe this happens all of the time. I waited for my beau who bought something after I did: another 15 minute wait.  Needless to say, I will not go here again.	0
First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.\n\nIts always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care. \n\nWe actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. \n\nJust go anywhere else, it can't be worse!	0
Nothing special. Precooked meals that taste microwaved.	0
Normally one would think, one chain restaurant is just like the rest but I have had nothing but problems here. The staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something. I've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues. Here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; I ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though I've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained.	0
I told everyone that I wasn't feeling this. Should have listened to my gut on this one. We didn't make reservations for our party of 7, which I suppose we should have. They had to create space for us. Like really create it. Where we were all sitting in the walkway. Knew I was in the walkway when the waiter asked for us to move so that a little girl in a wheelchair could get around. But I didn't have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building. And while you're eating too...it's so disgusting. The place is so freakin crowded as well...maybe just because I hate being in crowded and tight spots. \nAs far as the menu, I wasn't impressed. It took me 20 mins to find something (partly because I'm picky). But I ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo, nothing to rave about. I wanted more broccoli than what was provided, but oh well. The lime/kiwi lemonade was pretty good though.	0
They took their vegetarian meal off the menu.  They'll make one for you especially but I always feel demanding and would prefer if they had just kept it on the menu.\n\nPlus, this one is always really quiet.  Like, I feel guilty, like I'm troubling the staff.  And you have to drive through an apartment's parking lot to get there.  Very awkward location and atmosphere.	0
I have been going to Benihana's back when it was Samuri... I visit the Cleveland and Pittsburgh one frequently. The cleveland one is better but they are both going down hill at a very fast past. I keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed. They have changed so many things in the past year and its for the worse. The shrimp the order they give you the food, the way the cut the veggies. Im becoming a Huge fan of Itchiban both the one in robinson and cranberry, Its cheaper and you get more food for your money . I hope Beni's changes. I even e mailed them and they didnt respond .	0
I like this place it provides a great atmosphere and can handle big groups. They also send you a coupon for a free dinner on your birthday and can use it anytime during your birthday month.  I would recommend making a reservation as they are normally busy and it takes awhile to eat. But this is a great place to go for a special occasion.	1
The atmosphere was fun. Our chef was very nice and entertaining. The filet was excellent.  Their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste.  Over all it was a great time. I will definitely go back.	1
I have to admit, I kind of thought Benihana was fictitious until we moved to Pittsburgh... and then low and behold, there was one right near where we live. The food is okay. There are better hibachi options in the area. The service can be okay or awful. One time, we were there with our kids and had an absolutely EVIL waitress. One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately. You either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. WTF?	0
The sushi during happy hour is great. The wife and I eat well for $20.  That's drinking pop though.  Don't judge.	1
Very disappointing. We love Japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in Pittsburgh. Nice atmosphere, service was fine, but our dinner was average to poor. The salad dressing was tasteless, the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy.  It tasted more steamed than hot grilled. The shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful.\nOur chef ( new and slow) compulsively wiped his knives and the grill (which was dirty when we sat down) with a dirty rag? \nI guess a lot depends on the chef you get but ours cooked a tasteless meal. The sushi people ordered at the table looked good. \n\nWe are not big on the circus atmosphere of Saga, but the Wexford location does have the best hibachi food in Pittsburgh to our taste.	0
Love this place! Great sushi and have great sushi specials at lunch and HH. Bartenders are the best also. Marty is the man!	1
This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at.	0
This place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server 30 min to serv us drinks then took them 20 min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago . I recamen go sime where els n eat	0
I read a few of the reviews of Mad Mex and quite a few reviewers called their food Tex Mex and I don't see it that way. I see Mad Mex as more Cali Mex with the accent being on fresh ingredients, healthy cooking, and excellent service. The black bean soup is almost fat free and the best I've ever had. (try it Joe D style with a dollop of guac on it instead of sour cream) The lime cilantro salad dressing Is amazing, I've had it on the grilled portobello mushroom salad for a meat free meal. The grilled fish tacos are every bit as good as the famous fish tacos in San Diego. The fish is grilled perfectly, plenty of home made guac, pico, and sour cream accompany this dish. The beer list is a who's who of some of the finest micro brews across the states, including many IPAs which are rotated monthly. You can watch the bartenders squeezing fresh fruits and melons for their huge line ups of margaritas flavors. This little Pittsburgh gem of a restaurant is now opening locations in other cities like Columbus and Philly. There are many locations in the Burgh.	1
Love their spicy black bean dip and their black bean and pineapple quesadilla... mmmm can't get enough of their black bean.	1
"Not a pleasant experience.  While looking at the menu, we ordered a margarita and a draft beer.  The beer came in a bottle instead of a draft and the margarita had a terrible funky taste - almost a \""plastic chemical\"" taste.  Next we chose to have chips and dips/salsa.  We were able to choose three dips/salsas and the server brought one that was incorrect.  To his credit, he promptly corrected the error and brought the right one.\n\nNeedless to say we elected not to have dinner and departed after drinks and chips.  There is much better Mexican food and drink in the 'burgh."	0
"\""Meh.  I've experience better.\"" \n\nI find this fairly overpriced for the quality of food.  I think that the decor of the place and the witty menu drive up the \""like\"" of this place b/c it's modern and fun... but it all comes down to the food, and it's not something I'd think about again when I leave, but I wouldn't object too heavily if someone asked me to meet them there again.  They staff is nice, when it's busy they're a little slow.  The food is spicy, like the guacamole and house salsa - I like spicy, but it didn't really add flavor, just made my mouth burn enough to get a second margarita (which was strong - good, but strong w/ low-end tequila, yuck.. paid the extra $$ for better liquor).  The pico de gallo, my alternative to the spicy salsa, was as bland as they come so I settled on \""virgin\"" chips.  Everything is just mediocre and pricey... meh."	0
You have no idea how badly I WANT to like this place. They are incredibly vegetarian/vegan-friendly. I just haven't been impressed by anything I've ordered there. Even the chips and salsa aren't terribly good. I do like the bar-- they have great sangria-- but that's about it.	0
The food here is pretty good but the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. Our wait just to place drink orders was almost 15 minutes, had I not been exhausted from my drive in from Columbus I probably would have left then. However we stayed the waitress was slow, forgetful we had to yell for her or wave our arms if we needed anything. At one point the poor people next to us who had also received terrible Service were asked by the waitress a full 15 minutes after she placed their order if she had gotten their orders. I probably won't visit this location again on my next Pittsburgh trip.	0
"We went to the Mad Mex in Cranberry Twp and won't make the mistake of going back. \n\nThe food was horribly hot, like they just toss in heat for heat's sake, rather than for taste. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and that was NOT any kind of mole I've ever had. The sauce was more like a weak, thin ranchero sauce and both the sauce and the chicken was too hot. Even the guacamole was too hot. \n\nI recognize this restaurant chain is trying to be a trendy \""fusion\"" of Tex-Mex and CA, but they failed. Luckily, they are in the same parking lot as a pharmacy so I was able to walk straight over for some Tums.\n\nIf you want GOOD Tex-Mex, go to El Campo in Monaca or El Paso Mexican Grill in Chippewa. Both restaurants are excellent examples of good Tex-Mex, similar to the styles typically served in Central California."	0
I have always had a hit and miss experience with Mad Mex.  I love the fact that they have a great beer selection, but the food sometimes seemed expensive for the quality.  Last Saturday night the wife and I went to the Greentree location, and the food was very good.  My wife had a spicy chicken burrito, and my grilled fish tacos were fresh and full of flavor.  Of course, wouldn't you know we had a waitress that simply forgot about us.  No tea or water refill, no interest is selling me a second beer.  Oh well.	1
Always great service at the bar from Tanya and Nikki. Great food and wide selection of draft beers. One of my favorite spots.	1
Southwest chicken wings -cilantro- too good !	1
This afternoon I took my 4 year old to this mad mex for lunch after a great morning swimming and doing a yoga class.  We had to send back our food because the chicken was stone cold (even though surrounded by sizzling veggies on a skillet).  It seemed like it was yeterday's chicken.  They brought out fresh food and I'm kicking myself for having eaten it.  The rest of our day has been spent cleaning up food poisoning accidents and in the bathroom.	0
The food isn't terrible, but not impressive.  I lived in LA for 4 years, so I'm super spoiled when it comes to having good Meixcan food.  We got a burrito, which was just stuffed with fillers such as rice and beans..no thanks.  There was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever.  Who seriously wants a huge burrito like that?  I'd rather have a normal sized one that actually tastes good and isn't filled with crap.  We got the steak fajitas, which were actually pretty decent.  The steak was cooked perfectly as ordered, which I appreciate.  We also got the chips with salsa and guac, which were good, but, come on, it's really not hard to mess those up!  Overall, I'm just not impressed, but I guess you can't really find that great of Mexican food options in Pittsburgh.	0
While I LOVE Mad Mex, this one is to be avoided.  For whatever reason, they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions, I've just not felt well after eating there.  Because it's a BB, I just keep thinking I had to be wrong about that.  But after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues, I've had to write this location off.  Go to Robinson instead... (Or BB, please, please get a new KM for this location!)	0
Gobble-rito!\n\nI love Mad Mex and all the offerings.   My favorites are the Wing-o-rito and Gobble-rito(when offered).\n\nThe Wing-o-rito has your beloved wing sauce mixed in their hefty burrito.\n\nThe Gobble-rito is their seasonal Thanksgiving burrito with a side of cranberry.\n\nBoth are awesome!   Schedule your training appointments or your purge because these are high-calorie affairs but worth it.   Top it off with one of their signature drinks and you cannot go wrong :)\n\nEnjoy!	1
I think its time to sacrifice time and convenience. When we visit the area....this place always lacks the experience that we receive from ShadySide, Robinson, and Ross Park. Even though it closer to my Dad's House when visiting...its time for us to part ways. The food and service is never as good at this location. I love, love, love their tofu tacos...but this was just eh this time...it was as though the thick pieces fell apart and they were small and too crunchy and maybe just old...bleh. I couldn't even finish them, even though I cannot wait to eat them the 3 times a year I get to have them. Total Bummer.	0
"I'm in from out of town, and I'm so surprised and disappointed about the level of we received here during a quiet Sunday lunch hour. Our waitress gave us indignant responses to every request, with visible eyerolls to things like sharing fajitas. \n\nWhen an order came out completely wrong, she said \""Sorry for the mixup, but I don't control the kitchen\"" and made no effort to correct the order. Had she showed any effort or contrition, the error really wouldn't have bothered me, but she actually seemed to act like it was our fault. \n\nIt really disappointed me to have my dad treated like this on our family meal together on my final day in town. Please train your staff better and treat customers with any level of appreciation or helpfulness."	0
I love kitchen stores, and Crate is one of the best in pittsburgh. Recently I read a few articles about the dangers of non stick cookware. None of them are really any good for any of us. I won't get into what the dangers of them are, but they are real and most non stick cookware will be off the market by 2015.\n\nI started looking into enamel coated cookware, Crate has a number of different varieties and bought myself a 3 piece starter set with an 8, 10, and 12 inch pans. Like non stick, no oils are needed and clean up is pretty quick.\n\nCrate in itself is a cooking gadget Mecca. If you love stainless steel cookware, they have anything you want from All Clad, made right in Canonsburg Pa. There's Fiesta ware from Wheeling, and If you want Emeral's professional cookware , Crate has it.\n\nYou can take cooking classes here as well, they have a full service kitchen in back. Classes are limited to certain amounts due to space, but everyone sits after and enjoys the food they've prepped. \n\nIt's top of the line cookware so it has top of the line prices. But well worth it!	1
I attended the sushi class on Monday night.  The instructors were great:  friendly, funny, helpful.  The class structure was good, but certainly geared toward those who have never attempted making their own sushi before.  Everyone had their own station and was able to make three different rolls.  \n\nHowever, I seriously question the value.  The course was to be two and one half hours in duration.  After approximately seventy-five minutes, we began cleaning up to go home.  It should be noted that the 75 minute class time included a 10-15 minute sales pitch of Crate's products. For $60 per person, I was beyond disappointed.  It seems unethical and deliberately misleading to advertise the length of the class and barely run 50% of the scheduled time.\n\nThe bottom line:  good instruction, but you'll feel extremely cheated at the end.	0
Small store but the customer service is fantastic . I deal with the manager and the ladies in customer service area on a weekly basis and all have gone out of there way to help me out .	1
A very oddly laid out supermarket. the Deli isle is not very wide, the the walls are closing in on you, and they put the DIY olive cart in front to make it more cluttered. Just a poorly laid out store which is showing it's age.	0
Dirty and small.  Not laid out well.  Expired items on the shelves.  Rude cashiers.  Self check out usually broken.  Horrible experience more than once.  I don't shop here unless I have to.	0
Obviously, you aren't coming here because it is in any way cool, or because of the 80's decor. You got kids with you or others whose palette doesn't extend past burgers and fries. These limitations can be overlooked. What can't be forgiven, however, is the shabbiness of this place. It looks like it gets vacuumed once a week, and the bathrooms are disgusting.	0
GREAT Burger ! Loaded with Flavor, and ice cold beer. I normally do not visit chain eateries , but this place was close and very good for the money.\nGood job guys !\nOHHHHHHH , Did I mention FREE COOKIES ???? \nNice Touch !	1
Had a beer and an appetizer, so-so.  Service was nice and quick, which is about all I need with the kids.  Kids seemed to like their kids meals, the usual Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, chicken fingers.  Huge line at Mad Mex on Friday night, none here.  I doubt we will go back, too many other choices.	0
This is one of our go-to spots for a night out with the kids. The food and service are always dependable. This is the best Max and Erma's I've been to in PIttsburgh. Good quality American food, and free cookies on wednesday nights. Oh, and it's almost never too busy on the weekend. Great place for kids.	1
Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess, seated and ignored.   After 25 minutes without a server, I left.  Will not recommend to anyone else passing through.  I don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude.  Extremely dissatisfied.	0
Went there on my first day in Pittsburg. Wasn't the best experience. My waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldn't even give us any sauces. The food was ok but nothing to great. When I go back to Pittsburg I will not be going there again!!!!	0
Not up to it's previous brunch standards. Buffet has scaled back in variety and quality.   Still good but no longer excellent.	0
There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait, Ruby Tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. Anyways, the only reason I keep coming back is because my husband's family LOVES to use their back room for every occasion. Ugh. Can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? \n\nSo since we are forced to show up for family functions I've had cause to try much of the menu, and most of it is average or below. The only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. If you're not getting that, don't bother. I've heard about free cookie Wednesday, but come on, is that really going to drum up that much business? At Eat N' Park, free cookies are a staple. Get it together Max & Erma...	0
Absolutely horrible service, when we entered the hostess gave an audible sigh like we were inconveniencing her with our presence.  We were seated for over 10 minutes and never had a server come to even take drink orders.  Needless to say we left, and we will not be going back.	0
I love this Bruegger's! It's like the others in the chain so you probably either like their food or you don't. (But who doesn't like bagels?) But I find this particular Bruegger's to be exceptional. The staff is always kind and attentive, and I'm in love with their tomato caprese bagel sandwich. \n\nThey're convenient and delicious - what more can I say or ask for?	1
Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich,  Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea.  Usually you have to ask for decaf. \nHowever, lots of seats since the place was empty.  We left Einstein's because it was  crowded.\nThey Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer.  Guess it's back to Einstein's.	0
Frequently get take out from this place. Food usually fairly decent. Except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container. Called to complain and they offered 20% off our next bill and did not sound surprised by our find. Considering the money we have spent there over the years I was highly upset. But they seemed to care less. Guess I have to drive to sesame next time.	0
Consumer alert... rats!	0
"This Starbucks is in a strip mall at the bottom of Greentree hill and unfortunately has the unlucky fortune of being a hangout for the most obnoxious group of men who come into the store early in the morning, nurse a cup of coffee all day, take up all the chairs, and gobble up all the free samples of pastry that the baristas offer. It's really a shame too because this Starbucks has a fireplace with a nice fire working during the cold months. In the evening when the old man unemployment club leaves is a great time to visit. If not for the \""I can top that\"" club that come in everyday and tell the same old stories over and over IN SUCH LOUD VOICES, this would be one of my favorite Starbucks in the Burgh."	0
This Starbucks is right down the street from my parents house. It's gotta be my favourite location in the Pittsburgh area. I read Joe D's review and laughed a bit. He's right...there are some guys who sit in there, but have you ever said hello? Have you ever asked them if you could sit down? They're totally nice guys! The baristas here are really efficient (most of the time) and super friendly. They're on top of their game and even remember regular's drink orders.	1
So, now that the old timer glee club has abandoned this location, I can truly say that the relocation of this 'Bucks has become my favorite. Totally comfortable location, somewhat friendly associates, no fireplace anymore but I can overlook that. Lots of comfy leather chairs, you feel totally at home here. \n\nNormal coffee and tea menu, pastry case is always tempting and filled. Parking can be a hassle, but isn't that the case with any outdated strip malls in the Burgh?	1
I used to love Panera but as the years have gone by their standards of both food and service has declined greatly. It's a gamble if you are going to get good food and service or if the D team is working that day and they serve cold soup and sandwiches that look like Stevie Wonder  made them. I have to be deserate now to go there, like travelling on the Ohio turnpike and my other rest stop options are burger king and popeyes. Coprorate needs to improve and manage  their quality control,training, and processes. It's like they came out with a bang and now are just coasting.	0
Oh, I had fun here. They just need more portapottys. It's something to do and somewhere to people watch. And the fireworks were pretty.	1
The food and service were very good . The food is made from scratch on premises . The restaurant is owned and run by two brothers from the Green Tree area . I admire this and always try to give my business to local family run places like this . My only gripes are the limited selection at the bar and I feel the prices for food are very expensive for the portions you receive.	1
The place looks like something from the Godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling. Complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables. The food was cooked well, but lackluster. I got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth. On the plus, the staff was very nice and very attentive. \n\nManagement - you really need to update the place.	0
When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place	1
Came in here just reading some reviews, figured, I'll give it a shot, they were good.\nI walked in to an empty restaurant and was worried, but the owner Frank was there to greet me and how pleasant he was. He saw the concern on my face and brought me over to family pictures showing how long the restaurant has been in business and has been a success.\nSo, not knowing what to order, because so many things looked yummy, he suggested the Pork Chop Florentine, OMG!!! DELICIOUS!!!\nAND he prepared it himself!\nI definitely, highly, recommend dining here when in the Pittsburgh/Greentree area.\nThe reason for 4 starts not 5, the wine choices are lacking but the Red Rock Malbec was nice with the meal. \nAnd Stephanie the bartender, super sweet and makes you feel like you're a regular.\nGreat place!!!	1
Super fast service NY style crust pizza was great and crispy.	1
Service wasn't very good, and their (advertised) delivery was not available (because the delivery drivers car broke down). Maybe as a sit in it would be ok but I was not impressed	0
"Have mixed Vincent's.  My meal was good (spicy pasta) but service was spotty.  Another in the party had the homemade gnocchi and it was not good at all, \""tastes like dishwater\"", was the quote.  Naw, that couldn't happen to homemade gnocchi, after a taste, I agreed!  Just goes to show, it depends on what you order.\n\nOh yea, the parking lot, very big but some customers parked in the entrance on both sides to make it one lane and of course when we were leaving we noticed that one guy was taping his car where it had be hit."	0
Who knew french fries came on salads? Pittsburgh did.\n\nSalads are good. Pizza looked tasty. Service is helpful (when you can find it).\n\nThe pepper steak salad is pretty good - get it with ranch. Or instead, just get a plate of those garlic knots. They're the best thing there.\n\nAnd the comment about helpful service - when I went to pay the bill it was too windy for me to leave it out on the table. Instead I went inside and it was a no-man's land. No person working could be found for a good three minutes while I stood there with my bill in hand. I mean, what kind of place is dead empty of all wait staff, bartenders, or any person who worked there for that long during the lunch rush? Seems odd.	1
Overpriced, very slow service, food was decent.	0
Food is mediocre service is lousy. I'm sitting here right now and have been out of water and done eating for 20 min...	0
Love this place. Pizza is great and the stuffed peppers were perfect!	1
I went for dinner July 10.  Tight quarters inside but nice outside covered porch..Small inviting bar. Parking lot is full of potholes. It wont take much to fill with small stones but nothing has been done for years. It would be nice for customers to the fill potholes. \nFriendly staff . I ordered a Italian Hoagie and my wife had Spinach Ravoli. Waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks. My hoagie was dry with min meat. Bun was OK. My wife liked her salad. Both was very avg food in tight spaces and service could have been more attentive. Probably wont go back.	0
I had the buffalo chicken pizza and really enjoyed it! Good quality cheese and chicken.. Hearty proportions.. No complaints !	1
"This is a guest review from my wife Jodi, who grew up within walking distance of the Little Pink Doughnut Shop and came here often on her way to school and on weekends.\n\n\""Best doughnuts created by man.  I'm totally thinking about flapping my wings up to Pittsburgh right now at 2am to get some donuts.  Super-delicious.\n\nThey usually only have doughnuts until about 8 in the morning and they are SO DELICIOUS!  I used to get my lazy ass up at 6am to walk here and get some doughnuts, which is saying something because I like to sleep until 1pm.  I'd be like, 'Oh, it's a day ending in Y, I need to get my ass to the little pink doughnut shop.'\n\nThe doughnuts are so good I got the school bus driver to stop.  I offered to buy him one if he'd just stop long enough for me to go in, and he totally did.\n\nGo get some! Why are you still reading?\"""	1
Great old-school donut shop with delicious donuts.  The even still tie up the boxes.	1
A while back my Mom bought some donuts from here and they were really stale by the next day.  She called and mentioned something about it to them and they didn't even seem to care.  I like to try and support local business but with an attitude like they showed I have no use for them.  Doesn't seem to be any real set hours so you never know when they will be open.	0
Darren's recent review of Kmart got me thinking about this place. I was out this way recently and I stopped to look for a place to eat. Man, talk about a dead mall! Parkway Center Mall even has its own listing on www.deadmalls.com I'd only been here once or twice back in its heyday. Back then it had Chi-Chi's (where thankfully I never ate. A hepatitis scare did them in), David Weis, Pharmor, CompUsa, Syms, etc were all here. \n\nNow the mall is mainly deserted. Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle. Phantom of the Attic is alive and well and so is Pittsburgh Sports Deli. That's not an eatery either. It's a sports memorabilia store. \n\nThere wasn't much reason for me for me to linger here though.  I soon left and went over to Olive Garden for lunch.	0
What a depressing shell of a mall... \n\nI remember when it was *the* mall to go to... CompUSA, Pharmor, Kmart, Playless, Joann Fabrics, ChiChis, Giant Eagle... \n\nHell, CompUSA, ChiChis and Pharmor don't even exist anymore... I'm not sure if Kmarts are still in business. \n\nDead malls are sad, for some reason. Walking through this mall just creepy though.	0
"Truly the worst mall in America.  Going here is like being in a time machine though.  There is a store called \""90's Nails\"" for goodness sakes.\n\nHow is this place even still standing?  For one, I'm pretty sure it's built on an old mine or dig or something.  My mom has told me you can feel the ground move when you are here.  Yikes!\n\nThe Sports Deli is actually a gem of a store though.  Man, the rent has to be so cheap!\n\nI got to give a shout out to Petland (I think that's what it is/was called) the pet store in this mall where we got our Maltese pup Sno-Flake 17 years ago!  What a great dog!  :)"	0
Honestly I don't consider this place a mall. I consider it to be the entryway I have to use to get into K-Mart. Sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey, I'm sure the rent is reasonable considering the land is falling apart. Calling it a mall is like calling me an athlete it simply isn't true. When you can lists off the name of the stores on your fingers and still have a few left over then you need to go somewhere else.	0
Oy vey! Stay away, there's nothing here to see. Kmart, Phantom of the attic and a lottery place. This mall is dead! Deader than dead, dead dead!	0
I certainly have stayed in worse places, but they generally didn't cost $100 per night. \n\nTo be fair--the place is clean. The temperature was good. It's just small and old. The carpets are threadbare, in places. There is no restaurant, and no obvious nearby place to eat--I ended up driving around for a while before I found something. \n\nThe people who work here are very friendly, and as the previous reviewer wrote, it's got a manager's happy hour (which I arrived right before the end of), and a fitness center & pool. You have to reach the fitness center and pool by going outside, though, and in the middle of February, that's not so attractive. \n\nThe mall that is nearby is not really a mall. It's got a Giant Eagle and a KMart, but all the other businesses seem to have closed. Even the ATM was boarded up, which is really not a good sign.	0
I'm saying this is as good as it gets. \n\nIf you're a visitor coming for a Steelers game, that doesn't need 5 star accommodations, then I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out. Two words: FREE SHUTTLE. Hell yes, free shuttle to and from the Pittsburgh Steelers game(downtown Pittsburgh Hilton, about 1 mile away). Free shuttle to and from the airport. Complimentary managers happy hour (two free drinks per person). Complementary Internet and parking. Breakfast buffet in the morning. Seriously, as a tourist on my first trip to Pittsburgh for a Steelers game this hotel made everything way to damn easy. \n\nIt isn't 5 stars for it's glitz and glamour, however the rooms are clean and I cannot stress how tremendously friendly the staff is. It isn't exactly close to the downtown area, but like I said- free shuttles will take you there and pick you up. I can't recommend this place enough for it's 'value to complimentary services' ratio. Made my trip to Pittsburgh a breeze.	1
Easy access, plenty of parking, friendly staff, clean. A little old fashioned though but I think that's nothing to be bothered about if you just need a bed for a night. Glad they had an happy hour.	1
The rooms are laid out weird, and for the cost the rooms are not worth it.  There are also not many place to eat around the hotel.	0
"I hate Olive Garden. It makes me laugh when they ask \""how is everything?\""  I wonder what goes through their minds when I say \""The microwave did an awesome job\"". I'm in town for a few days, I'm hung over and don't know where else to eat. Olive Garden is just gourmet ChefBoyArDee. You won't find me at an Olive Garden back in New Jersey!"	0
I ordered food that I believed was gluten free.  Within twenty minutes I started to have symptoms and was sick for two days.  I believe that my food may have been gluten free but that cross contamination caused my problem.  I had the same experience at another Pittsburgh Olive Garden restaurant and so am concluding that they may not be careful with cross contamination.	0
"Yep, it's a chain. Yep it's the but of a lot of jokes by the \""In the know\"" set.  Yep, it is kind of inexplicable how long the wait can be on weekends. Yep, I know it's more politically correct to eat at a  locally-owned family restaurant.  \n\n But you know what? \n\n I've never once had a bad meal there.  I've never once had less than top-shelf service there.  I find Olive Garden restaurants have consistently higher quality not only compared to the other franchise stores in it's price range, but also notably better than some family owned Italian restaurants I could name."	1
Avoid at all costs!  They diluted my wine with water, the food was mushy, they charged me $3.25 for marinara sauce from A CAN (without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place)!  Typical big corporation: cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the CEO can fly in his private jet (after landing, eat at a REAL Italian restaurant) and purchase a new Bentley each year.  \n\nVisit DeBlasio's Restaurant for twice the portions; it is MUCH CHEAPER, as well.\n\nWorst experience at a restaurant... EVER!	0
Ten minute wait and easily most tables are open!!! Surprise it's lunch time!!!! I just passed six tables empty and clean. Beyond me...	0
"This is a review for Holiday Inn Express- Greentree (April 7th).\n\nIt's the remodeled Best Western Inn. The new Holiday Inn Greentree is beautifully remodeled and closely located to all the fun in downtown.\n\nThe rooms come equipped with a microwave & fridge! BALLING! Tired of take out? There's a Giant Eagle (grocery store) in walking distance! Can you say CONVIENT! Free breakfast buffet for the guest? SAY WHAT? Think P Diddy status when you walk though the door and everyone is your Fonzworth Bentley. \n\nWhen I return back to \""the Burgh\"" I will definitely return back to this hotel!"	1
This review if for the Holiday Inn-Greentree. I was traveling in Pittsburgh for work and picked this Holiday Inn due to it's proximity to downtown. I was not disappointed. This has been one of the better hotels I have stayed in.\n\nThe facility is very clean and the staff is very helpful. You can tell they recently renovated. Their workout facility was great, which is a nice change of pace from the majority of the hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are very spacious and have a refrigerator and microwave. This is great if you don't feel like going out to eat. There is a Giant Eagle right down the street too.\n\nThe hotel offers free wifi which has great speed and makes working from your room easy. There is a shuttle service that runs from the hotel to down town ever hour. All you have to do is ask the front desk and they will help you coordinate. They offer a free breakfast in the morning which is always great as well.\n\nThe next time I am in the Pittsburgh area I will be returning.	1
Beautiful hotel exterior and lobby. clean, spacious rooms, lots of closet space, 24/7 fitness hours, extended pool hours 6am-11pm.   Great complimentary breakfast.  Close to tons of chain restaurants and fast food and a couple of family-owned italian restaurant (Vincent's was delicious). I loved the location, access to parking, convenience,  friendliness of the staff.  It was almost perfect! \n\n The only downside (that's why 4 instead of 5 star) is that the rooms are DARK.  I had every light on and it was still pretty dark during a cloudy day.  It probably doesn't bother most people who will just come back to their hotel to sleep.  It is not too unlike other hotel rooms but it seems TOO dark. Not enough light to read from unless you are in the bathroom.	1
Hotel itself is adequate.  The 2 stars are for the hotel's internet connection.  I've stayed here twice in one week and both times were frustrating in terms of the Wi Fi. The connection drops numerous times in one session and connecting can be a chore. In terms of smartphones, don't even bother. My iPhone just refuses to fully connect and I've tried everything.  I stay at hotels continuously throughout the year  and this hotel has the worst internet configuration out of them all.\n\nThe staff is great and helpful but as someone who travels for business, the Wi Fi connection is crucial to my experience.	0
oh. dear. lord. i feel so bad for the tour group from japan that was here .... this place is the dumps.  we had 2 rooms: they were supposed to be on the same floor.  nope. 2 different floors, took 6 rooms before we had 2 rooms that were NOT dirty.  One bed was unmade each day. Drunk frat rats.  AVOID.	0
Place is ok but a little uncomfortable. There's water damage in some corners of the the ceiling and it looks pretty creepy. There are stains on the walls and ironing board but, overall, it's ok. The bathroom was freshly stocked, toilet and shower was clean and functional, bed seemed to be bedbug-free and is comfortable enough to lay your head at night, TV worked just fine as well. The continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster. The place is pretty much centrally located & it does have great potential..overall, it was an ok stay and I may stay again after they've completed the renovations.	0
Umm lol so seriously I read some reviews about this place and was like NOOOO it can't be that bad. HA HA....DUDE! So this spot is like mad cheap but REALLY? \n\nFirst we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations. Checkin was seamless as it should be. We get to out room #122 and after reading the reviews I know to check the beds immediately. The first bed legit has hair under the sheets...strike 1. As I'm pulling the covers back on the second bed I find two quarters...that's right folks! Obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the SHEETS HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED...let alone checked. I mean really? You couldn't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs?\n\nWe go to the desk and make them aware of the issue. They apologetically get us another room. This room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned. The elevator by the desk is stuck on the 3rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs. Thank God for yelp....You've all been warned lol SERIOUSLY!	0
we checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like, moldy ceilings,  musty smells, unclean rooms, and such a huge renovation job it should be shut down or discounted by 99%! thank god hotwire gave us a refund.	0
"Nightmare.  It's a ghost town. Needles in parking lot. \""Lobby\"" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around. Asked to see our rooms before checking in, given the key, room was filthy.  Saw a sticky note re: bedbugs.  Bolted, as fast as possible."	0
This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't just that there was MASSIVE construction going on, but they did nothing to accommodate for it. They put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings, spackle, and sheetrock everywhere. The lights were broken and the room was filthy. \n\nThe second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldn't reach the outlet, rendering it useless in the middle of the summer, had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor. \n\nThe CHILDREN working the front desk, which was located in a hotel room, gave the worst customer service, greeted me with an attitude, and couldn't manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner. \n\nThe worst. Do not stay here.	0
"Wish I could give this place negative stars. Where to begin? It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their \""temporary lobby\"" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad, but my gosh they have crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew they were under construction before we booked in June, and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand. Extremely disappointed."	0
Boston Markets are the same anywhere, but the people who work here are great. This is my favorite one!	1
Junk worse than McDonald. My wife is a fan of this shop in Fairfax VA. Westopped for a quick breakfast. The poppers were stale bagels hard and the worst thing was when they heated the egg omlette in the microwave. For someone who does not use this at home, was a shock.. threw the stuff into the trash can.. the whole thing cost 25$..you decide if it was worth it	0
What a crock!   The thin bagel (with asparagus/mushrooms, swiss)...you get mostly cheese...it doesn't look at all like the picture on your website depicting a load of asparagus smothered in mushrooms...so full of it; definitely not worth the price. \n(this was the one in Greentree)	0
I stopped here yesterday morning because I was attending an off-site training session.  Typical Starbucks.  On the way back, I bought some of that new Starbucks VIA instant coffee to try at the office.  VIA does not taste like brewed coffee, so Starbucks loses one star for that.	0
This is a decent location if you happen to be near Market Square and you're craving Starbucks. It gets crazy busy and parking can be tough since it's in a touristy location, but the lines move pretty quick as they always seem adequately staffed.\n\nUnfortunately, this location has a limited retail area. We were looking to pick up some Verismo pods and they didn't carry any the last time we were there. Odd.	1
Worst effin Starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks. Horrible customer service and they ALWAYS screw up our orders. I just don't understand why they're so lazy. I understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though. But, if you hate your job, don't take it out on the loyal customers! Your life sucks, we get it, but you have ONE job at Starbucks, so do it right. It's not hard.	0
"Came here for a \""quick\"" breakfast on our way from the hotel to Fallingwater, and regretted the decision immensely.\n\nExtremely long lines, and poorly trained staff. As a former employee, I know about staff roles and approximately how long it should take to receive your drink. This staff was not trained at all, and it was clear that they were overwhelmed with the crowd. It took me 32 minutes for me to receive my order (there were 7 customers in front of me), and my order was incorrect. I ordered a small coffee, medium latte, a croissant and a sausage breakfast sandwich. I know that the sausage sandwiches heat up for about 40 seconds in oven, so I can't comprehend why it took so long to get my order. Would never come here again. I also received a WARM cheese danish instead of my croissant. First, the warm, creamy colored goo in the middle is extremely unappetizing, and second, they looked so dejected when I pointed out that I ordered a croissant I almost just left.\n\nDo not recommend."	0
MARKET SQUARE.....The slowest, most inaccurate Starbucks that I've ever seen....how can you write an order on a cup and still get it wrong....I saw 3 wrong orders (including mine) in the 25 minutes that I spent waiting...I was 4th in a line of 10	0
regarding Shari's review: when i went they wouldnt even accept my debit card .  she was an older woman who i do not think knew how to use the machine so i ended up going across the street to pnc and using the atm.  it is not top quality work, they def over charge for the level of work they do...maybe that's bc their rent is high in downtown? it is about average price for nails though so doesnt hurt the pocket...but there are alot of places that do better for the same price.  its a convenient location so i would go back if i needed a last minute job, but def not my first, second, or third choice.	0
"I should've believed what was already written but It was close to my hotel. The WORST mani/pedi of my life. I'm 43. I'm a flight attendant. I've been to a LOT of nail salons. I swear she wasn't licensed. She had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for 40 years. She clearly needs to retire and the male owner was an a$$. He says \""not everyone does it the same.\"" Well..... They certainly should come close!! No cuticle push back. Didn't know how to remove gel polish. Didn't file straight or smooth. Didn't clean under my nails after lotion. I had to tell her to take alcohol to my nails to clean off lotion and remind her to use a base coat. Then she polished all over my cuticle. 17 hours later having done nothing but sleep workout and shower the polish is chipped off 6 nails."	0
I guess this will be my last good review for Princess nails. Unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened. I have one eyebrow! Its slowly growing back but the idea of having to pencil in my eyebrow everyday is starting to get to me. \n\nUnfortunately I don't know what happened? Michelle are you going blind? Are you okay? Obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which I had to have someone else fix because you botched mine. I cried, I weeped, i found myself in the fetal position. I'm no longer going back. \n\nI know some people have off days but this was BAD.	0
"By far the worst Shellac manicure I have ever had. I went down on my lunch break for a quick mani. First the woman rushed through my \""manicure.\"" I'm not sure they have any type of sanitizer for their instruments as she kept pulling things out of her drawer. The manicure was very quick and not at all thorough. Once she started to paint my nails she kept having to fix them because she was in a such a rush. She took off polish that was on the nail and then pushed my hand into the UV dryer. When she went to put the top coat on my Shellac she put the Foundation coat on 2 of my nails before she realized and wouldn't fix them saying they will be fine. During the entire process she did about 6 eyebrow waxes and then would forget where she was in my process. She also kept forgetting to turn on the UV dryer to the point where she walked away and I had to turn it on.\n\nDo not go here. If I could give it 0 stars I would."	0
"I got a good haircut here a few months ago, so this one-star review is not intended for the stylists.  It is a response to a strict no-returns policy on salon products, which makes me pretty mad: I couldn't have known they recommended the wrong product without trying it, and now that I tried it, they won't refund my purchase.  Catch-22.  I came in to buy a replacement for my normal bumble and bumble curl creme for thick hair, and was told by the receptionist that bumble and bumble's \""defining creme for fine curls\"" is the new packaging of that product (which seemed weird to begin with...thick hair..fine curls...) Nope, it's totally different and it doesn't work for me.  I used it twice, figured that out, and now I'm stuck with an expensive product I can't use. I called bumble and bumble and they told me that the product I use has been discontinued.  All my previous salons in other cities would have honored a return in this situation.  I won't be back to MCN."	0
The salon is nice, and the people were great, but I was not impressed. The haircut was mediocre, but the highlights were much worse. They didn't even cover up all of my roots! I don't know much about hair, but the place I went before I moved always made great suggestions and chose highlights that were perfectly suited for my skin color and for the season. MCN failed to do this in a big way.	0
Excellent Salon.  I went to Kara for curly hair as Nicolette was not available (this was my first visit:  I recently moved to PGH and used these Yelp reviews to help me pick).  She was perfect:  friendly, professional, and gave me the exact cut and color that I asked for.  It was just as I'd imagined it, only better because it was on my head!  And she KNOWS curly hair -- how to cut it, manage it, style it.  It is rare for me to feel so confident in a stylist. Absolutely worth it.  No complaints at all. Thank you Yelp!	1
Brent is good.  Like reviewers prior, it isn't cheap.  And you will get upsold.  But that's part of the deal, I think, when you go to a salon like this.  Best thing about salon is the location on the third floor.  Color was done well, cut was ok.  Probably won't go back because I have found cheaper salons that do a better job since going to MCN.	1
My stylist (Abbey) definitely knows how to do my hair exactly in the manner that I want. Everyone at MCN are really nice and friendly. It may be a bit pricey, but for a good haircut wouldn't you pay a good price too?	1
Today, I definitely didn't have a great experience at MCN. I got my haircut couple months ago from there and I liked it, so I decided to go again for coloring today.\nI wasn't happy about it at all -cuz I can still see the line btw my root and the bottom. PLUS, they charged me 25 bucks more for the blow-dry without telling me. I wish I didnt go there for the color..	0
Just tried MCN salon for the first time this week and had an amazing experience there. the stylist (Jesse) sat me down and assessed my hair, and told me her honest opinion about what she thought it needed and the best kind of cut for me. It was perfect! I'm so happy someone finally took the time to actually give my hair a good look and tell me what it needed. I will definitely be going back!	1
This is actually my second time at MCN, but I had stellar experiences both times. My first cut was with Sara and my second with Heather. \n\nI'm pretty particular about the way my hair is cut because I've had the same style for years now and know how I want it cut so that it grows out well. What's great about MCN is that the stylists make sure to talk to you in depth about your cut before picking up the scissors, and are great about pausing at certain points in the cut to make sure that you're happy with the way it's going. I really appreciate that, and have had great experiences with both stylists. At this point, I'm really confident in going to MCN and getting a great cut, and will definitely go back.	1
"I'm in search for the best stylist when it comes to curly hair. \n\nHere's is where I met the charming Kara last week, with whom I had a great consultation. I explained that I needed a haircut that was intended for curly hair, with layers and not so symmetrical. I wanted a cut while the hair was dry but I let her do what was best for her, knowing that most stylist don't work this way. So she cut my hair wet, dried it and finished while it was dry. I got a cut that's a bit too short (that's the problem with cutting curly hair while wet - it \""shrinks\"" once it dries) but I really like it!\n\nThe hair salon is very trendy. It was busy at the time I showed, one weekday afternoon. Two bulldogs came in after being walked and hang out at the back of the salon. I'm assuming they're the owner's dogs. \nHairdryers hung on of the mirrored walls. Very nice staff, specially at the reception area where they had beverages and pastries."	1
I really enjoyed the amazing environment at MCN.  Cookies and water with fruit infusion at the entrance - and a kind, sweet receptionist to introduce me to the place set the perfect tone.  The receptionist is new so it sounds like the owners are actually listening to the complaints regarding the previous staff in this area.\n\nMy appt with Lacey was great.  I talked with her about color options and products to make my curly hair tame and straight.  She gave great suggestions and my blow out was definitely runway pretty.  \n\nA few things though - price is definitely even more steep than Capristo.  Unfortunately, though my hair looked amazing, it definitely took her a lot longer to blow me out and I have grown accustomed to Kim's speedy blowouts at Capristo.\n\nIn conclusion, the ambiance is WAY better at mcn and I am def considering returning if I still can't achieve the ombre color I want with Kim.  The place is so darn cute that I will probably still pop in every now and then for a blow out.	1
I have finally found my forever salon!! I love this place! Great service, educated stylists regardless of what level they are.  The owner is so nice and is truly concerned with each client in the salon.  I would recommend this place over any other salon in the area!  Margeaux my stylist was great, she took the time to get to know me, found out what I like and provided great insight.  I love the color and cut!! It maybe a bit pricey, but very worth it, if you are a fan of amazing service and work!	1
I have been sitting here looking at the poor quality of my shellac manicure and I just had to write. I walked in to Kenny's nail salon this afternoon and was pleased that there wasn't a wait. They also provided very friendly customer service.\n\nHowever, my manicure looks terrible! It looks like I painted my nails myself, only even I could do better. The paint and clear gel is all over the underside of my nails and baked on, no less. I'm even finding paint on my fingers now. The nail technician, a female, didn't even touch my cuticles, but she did use an electric file to shave down the nail bed. I guess that's supposed to count for the cuticles? No frills, no hand massage, not even any moisturizer or cuticle oil or anything.\n\nI am horrified I was charged $25 and then I even tipped 20%. Now I'm wishing I would have asked them to start over, perhaps with a different nail technician. I won't be going back, however. At least I was in and out in 25 minutes. But what a terrible job.	0
They suck!! First of all not even 24 hours after I got acrylics one broke, then they painted on the french white tips which is fine, however they did such a poor job. When I came back to ask for a refund they were very rude about it and refused to help. I have gotten my nails done almost for a year and I have never seen such a poor job. DO NOT GO HERE.	0
The worst experience ever. I have never complained about my nails bc im pretty laid back but this was insane. The man that was doing my nails had an incredibly shaky hands, cut me more times than I can count, and have the nails literally one and a half times the size of my nail beds. I got pink and white and the white was not uniform among any of the nails and usually wasn't even uniform from one side of the nail to the other . . On 1 of my nails the white was 3 eights of an inch on 1 side and 1 eighth on the other. The equipment to scrub the nails was unsanitary and in a dirty cup. I have never had such a negative experience anywhere and I kept trying to explain what was wrong to the man and he just wouldn't listen. He did not smooth down any of the nails until the third time I complained about it. I spent $85 at the salon and have to go and get them redone by a different technician tomorrow because I don't even trust them to redo their mistakes	0
SoHo clearly relies on the Pirates crowd across the street, and Steelers and Pitt games. When there's a game, the place is packed. Other times, it doesn't seem so busy. The food has been OK. It's generally bar food, with an effort to be more. Execution is varied. \n\nTry the seasoned tuna sandwich with a side of parmesan risotto; just tell them how you want the tuna cooked because they don't seem to know and will overcook it.	0
My family and I stopped by here for a quick dinner before the Pirates game. Since it was a game day, they were offering a limited menu that boiled down to typical bar food. Sandwiches, wings, etc. But, WOW...what bar food it was!\n\nThe burgers were amazing. My dad got a steak salad that was delicious. I think my mother was able to get some sort of pasta dish that she really enjoyed as well.\n\nGood food, at a fair price. I will be back the next time I am in the 'burgh for a game. :)	1
Stopped in for lunch before a Bucs game. Great service and food.  Hamburger was thick and juicy cooked perfectly.  Service is excellent.  I can highly recommend SoHo as your pre Bucco stop.	1
A nice selection of drinks (reasonably priced for Downtown Pittsburgh + next to a stadium) and the menu was easy to follow with plenty of variety. \n\nFood was well cooked and fresh ingredients - it was worth sitting outside!	1
My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey.	0
Spicy BLT was excellent! Jalape\u00f1o Bacon and Basil Mayo...don't get me wrong, this isn't a high end establishment but that was a damn good sandwich. Friend with me was not impressed with the Filet Medallions on Bruschetta but the desserts were good and my BLT was GREAT!	1
We we're not impressed. The prices are high for what is bar food with no real uptake.\n\nService was neutral both visits (stayed in attached hotel).\n\nWould be willing to grab a cocktail but definitely better options around.	0
I'm staying at the hotel at which the soho is located and I thought it would be a convenient place to eat dinner. Well, it was overpriced and the food was terrible. I ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room. The pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy, the chicken was overdone (dry), and the tiny (super tiny) roll was dry and stale. Very bad food and overpriced. Not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful. She then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didn't say a word, though I met eye contact with her as soon as it happened. She was more interested in talking with the other waitresses.......you know she got a great tip :)\n\nTry another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel, there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotel....Atrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff. \n\nhttp://www.atrias.com/	0
I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch.	0
Nice looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years.   After waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.  Hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   It is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were.	0
Soho was disappointing. Lunch was very crowded, so we sat at the bar, even though there was an open table for 3 by the window. We were just 4, but they wouldn't let us put an extra seat at the open table. It was also very loud for a weekday, the noise from other tables carrying easily.\n\nI ordered the french dip sandwich, with risotto on the side. To their credit, the risotto was delicious, but such a tiny portion, I inhaled it in no time. Especially considering the french dip was so boring. The meat and cheese was bland and the sauce had far too many herbs in it. Not to mention, the food is definitely over-priced. I don't think I'd go back, but if I did, I'd order the risotto and nothing else.	0
Bar next to stadium\nTypical\nbar next to stadium place\nWaitresses def looking for other jobs \nNot happy at all\nThis isn't even a game night	0
I love it here.  Great game day event location.  Great meeting.  Huge bar.  Huge selection.  Not just bar food.  So you will enjoy a dinner.   If you have the munchies it will hit the spot.   Ok do let's do it.  Have some fun.	1
No redeeming qualities here. Schwill on tap. Food was terrible - had the pizza, mac & cheese bites, and spinach & artichoke dip.  It was hardly edible. Stay away.	0
Meh. \n\nI always hope for the best. I did not, however get the best. Although I would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer wasn't bad. But I really don't think there's much you can mess up. The buffalo pierogies however, was a total miss. \n\nI do not want to make any accusations, but they did not seem to be freshly made, maybe frozen pre-made ones. And they were covered in hot sauce. It didn't look appetizing, nor did it actually taste appetizing. \n\nThey have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. But all the special drinks were mixed, and I knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me. \n\nI went with a glass of Malbec, which was a good choice. Actually, it was the best choice there. Maybe stick to beer or wine and you'll be good to go here.	0
Had the chicken sandwich,  my sister had the guiltless chicken. 30 minutes after ordering, our waitress came over to ask again what we had ordered because she had forgot to put the order in. Food was flavorless, plain. Was there a few nights ago for drinks after the game, waiter wouldnt allow 3 of us to sit at a 4 top table (but had a party of 1 sitting at a 4 top right next to the table we were going to sit at). Do they even have tables for 3?? 15 minutes later... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there. Overall, its a close spot to PNC but given both experiences, wouldnt return.	0
Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife, no mashed potatoes, no asparagus as ordered. So, Check your order. I mean for a 2 person $50 meal with tip I would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered & asked before we left. \n\nBut skip the 20%, $10 room service fee & http://www.sohopittsburgh.com. walk downstairs.	0
This place was a nice venue. The wait ayah was friendly and inciting and my food was tremendously delicious. I'd recommend it to anyone. Only complaint was the amount of time to be seated	1
From March 2013 visit: the food was much better, good enough that I want to return. I had salmon, quinoa, spinach, pesto, bread (that's all I remember). I'm upgrading to 4 stars.\n\nFrom Aug. 2009: The most disappointing thing about this place is the temperature: uncomfortably cold.  Probably 60 degrees (on a warm day in August!).  The whole dining area was cold; it wasn't just our table.  When we brought it to the attention of the waiter he said there's nothing they can do about it; it's the hotel's cooling system.  That's insane!  Don't they care about the comfort of their customers?\n\nThe food was good, but the waiter did a poor job: he got one order correct, but they botched Jo's fish dish (she asked for the rice pilaf without tomato, and they brought her the standard rice pilaf with tomato), and they botched my order (I didn't order the prix fixe dinner, but they charged me for it (at a cost of $7 more), even though I communicated my order clearly.	1
I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.\n\nI tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque, the halibut, and the pork-chop with coleslaw.  The lobster bisque was bland and cold.  The halibut was decent.  The pork chop was so bitter and dry.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of the place seemed standoff-ish and was not friendly.  Furthermore, it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way, she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here.	0
For a place that has a $75 entree I was pretty shocked to see a $2 charge for blue cheese olives on my bill... pretty tacky.   That was definitely a first.  I was disappointed the waitress didn't say anything either. Aside from that the service was pretty good... and the sashimi was a great value.  But everything else about this place is shwag.  The seared tuna - garbage, rainbow roll and Caesar salad - weak,  and the sides incredibly small.  The place has the feel of a riverboat buffet.  If this was stand alone they would only get away with charging 40% of what they are now... in the Westin.\nI would skip it, or if you have to, get sashimi at the bar and make sure you review your bill.	0
Having read positive things about OFM lately, I thought we'd give it another try as it's been years since we've eaten there.  Unfortunately, our experience was dreadful.\n\nI knew going in that the food was overpriced.  Always has been.  But not only can you get less expensive fish/seafood elsewhere, but you also can get FRESHER food at other places.  Our food tasted frozen and overcooked.  \n\nWhat has NOT changed is the extremely poor service.  If you don't look wealthy or if you're not buying multiples rounds of alcohol, the wait staff avoids you.  And that was our experience the other night.  \n\nHow can restaurants get away with poor service and bland food at such high prices?  I guess OFM lives off the travelers and not the locals.	0
"Serviceable \""upscale\"" chain seafood spot, with both traditional dishes and sushi.  Yes, it's expensive, but it's one of the few spots open late downtown.   The sashimi was pleasant, and it's hard to screw up oysters and seafood pasta.   Our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations.\n\nThe service is on par with your local crap-on-the-wall chain restaurant, so don't expect too much."	0
"One in our party summed it all up:  \""When you're paying these prices, you should expect better service.\""\n\nThe food was good.  I had a sashimi platter with some additional pieces, which was perfectly average.  You can get the same thing around the corner at Sushi Kim...and I think the quality is a bit better and the price lower.\n\nAnother in our party had the rib eye.  It was cooked well and he liked it.  For dessert the cheesecake was good, although the blueberries were clearly from frozen (unacceptable in July when they're in season).\n\nI had to sit and wait 5 minutes after my food was brought out before I could flag down a server to ask for some chopsticks and soy sauce.\n\nIt's not that the servers aren't working...it's that they're spread too thin.  Understaffed.  All working hard, but covering too many tables.\n\nLong story short, I won't go back.  Walk over one block and go to Eleven!  Same price, better food and service."	0
- The bread was good and so was the spicy shrimp butter that came with it.\n- The lobster bisque had a very slight gummy texture to it, as if too much flour had been used.  \n- I had the lobster pasta and I was a little disappointed with the lack of sauce that accompanied it.  It was really more of a broth than anything, which made the pasta seem too soggy and also drippy and messy to eat.  My wife had the fillet mignon, which she said was one of the best she's ever had.  She thought the potato side was just so-so.\n- Each of us had a drink with our meal, which put our total at $115, including the tip.  I expect to be a little bit more wowed with a meal for that price.	0
I have eaten there several times.  This is an overpriced overhyped seafood restaurant.  The portions are not worth the price.  The Sushi is average at best.  The service has been poor almost every time I went.  We complained once to the manager and in the middle of talking to her she picked up the phone and totally forgot she was talking to us.  \n\nThe salads are small and nothing to write about.  The decor needs to be updated. If you ask me why I keep going back; it's not by my choice.  Usually we have several people staying at the Westin.	0
Came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service. Finally went searching for someone, who only came back with our order after we had nearly given up. And refills on water, coffee or soda? Forget about it.	0
I have never had such awful, inedible food at such an appallingly ridiculous price. It's not only a failure in execution, the plates are very poorly put together, and the flavors of the sides and sauces with the protein do not marry well at all. I was severely disappointed by plating, and then just got mad when I started eating.\nYou would think for 44$ your steak would at least be properly cooked. What was supposed to be medium, came raw. The steak was tough and tasteless. \nAhi tuna, asked rare, was overcooked; also bland, even with the sauce. The oshinko side was laughable. Seriously. I laughed. \n\n pasta was overcooked, and by the time it got to us, the sauce was laminated with coagulating fat. \nThe sushi was an amatuer attempt at best.  There was too much rice, and presentation was sad. \nAmbience is tacky. Ugly 80s-reminiscent wallpaper covers half the room and framed sketches of fish plaster the other half.\nService was the only redeeming quality. \nTo put it in perspective, my neighborhood Houlihans seems gourmet next to this place.	0
"We were staying at the Westin and it was late and the Original Fish Market was right on site. Well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. We waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. A simple \""Sorry for the wait\"" would have been nice. We were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. Unfortunately we did not.  The food was all bland and tasteless. Oh! Except for the bold taste of Obay on the fries. I had blackened rainbow trout.  I expected a bold favors but yet nothing. It was not even blackened.  Looked like paprika for color, but that was it.  Mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box. We skipped dessert for obvious reasons. I am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal. I hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that I could have done better myself.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid the Original Fish Market.  I was generous to give one star."	0
Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked the fish stew though.  It had lots of beans, was thick and chili-like. The rest of the lunch was so unnoteworthy, I can't remember what I ordered, though almost all of it was still on the plate at the end of lunch.  I do remember the bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day.	0
"Literally the worst restaurant experience that I've ever had, including McDonald's and 24-hour scarf-and-barf diners.\n\nPittsburgh is undergoing a bit of a food renaissance, yet the Original Fish Market continues to put out an inferior product in a horrendous atmosphere at an obscene price.  \n\nOur fish was tasteless and rubbery, my white wine came out at room temperature, the restaurant was extremely dirty, and our server was clearly apathetic.  \n\nThe Original Fish Market opened in 1998, and quickly found a place in the market in a city where Red Lobster was still considered \""good seafood\"".  As top-notch restaurants entered the market, the local palates grew up in a big way.  The Original Fish Market seems content to remain frozen in time competing as a mediocre option in an under served market space.  Unfortunately for them, their market space is now flooded with options offering a far superior product  at a fraction of the price."	0
I went for lunch last week.  The food was awful.  Do not waste your money at this restaurant.	0
One of the only places open downtown after 10 pm mid-week. Terrible service, average and overpriced food, in a hotel lobby, doesn't make a good combo.	0
I've been meaning to go back to the Fish Market for so long. I remember the great crab legs I had years ago. I finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed.\n\nThe service was great. We sat at the bar and in no time both bartenders greeted us with smiles and menus. I guess my main concern was the food quality. I ordered the beet salad with warm goat cheese (was not warm at all) and shrimp and scallop linguine. Both were not unique in flavor or presentation. It was as if I made it in my own kitchen. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster bisque and his seafood jambalya that was perfectly spicy.\n\nI do applaud the venue for offering a diverse and affordable wine list. And, with all due respect to owners, I think the atmosphere needs a serious update in character and aesthetics. Especially since other key hotels are more pleasing to the eye. This should be vital to one of the BEST hotels in the city! \n\nI'd like to return someday to give it another go. We shall see.\n\nP.S. Invest in better wine glasses. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly.	0
I read the reviews here and still decided to try it out. It's SUPER close to work and I was craving some miso soup. I am really glad I didn't let the reviews stop me. I thought that they had pretty descent Sushi. The city of Pittsburgh isn't exactly a mecca of Japanese cuisine, but I think it's VERY comparable to other places throughout the area. I got the OFM roll and it was extremely fresh and really delicious. I totally recommend!	1
just went for drinks.  Seemed nice.  Good happy hour	1
"Have you ever eaten in a place where the whole seems far less than the sum of its parts?  Believe me, the Original Fish Market fits that description.  I met my mom and dad here for a pre-concert (Bonnie Raitt) dinner and honestly I wish we'd gone someplace else.  \n\nTo be fair there wasn't anything particularly wrong with the food or service.  I've enjoyed seafood restaurants before and while my dinner was okay, it was only just \""okay\"".  There wasn't anything particularly memorable about it.  Nothing that made me say, \""Wow\""!  My parents didn't hate their dinners either but they weren't impressed.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.  The Original Fish Market wants to be a swanky hotel restaurant.  It certainly sets its prices high enough ($25.00-$45.00 per entree).  But the quality just doesn't match the price."	0
Had awesome service and pretty excellent sushi. They have these lettuce wraps which are to die for! Highly suggest them.	1
I come here perhaps twice a week for the past few months. The lobster bisque and salmon are great. Apart from that, try their salmon and tuna sashimi. If you're at the sushi bar, you're in and out with a wholesome meal within half an hour which is great when you're travelling for work and need a quick meal	1
I've been to the Fish Market many, many times over the last 18 years or so. It doesn't change much. They get maximum money for average seafood (or anything else). \n\nThe sushi wasn't great this last trip (last week), and didn't taste terribly fresh. The Miso soup was barely average. I did like the Tataki roll, but it was the only saving grace of the meal. \n\nOverly expensive for what you get, and service can range between average and terrible. \n\nOh, and the bartender that's been there for as long as I've been going is seriously crappy, and I'm amazed he's lasted so long - is that a union gig?	0
"McCormick & Schmick's knockoff is the best way to describe this completely non-memorable place. \n\nI agree with the other person who said \""it's trying to be a swanky hotel bar/restaurant\"". That may sound dumb but as someone who frequents hotels & their restaurants it can easily go either way. I've found you can get a great read on a place by the vibe of a hotel lounge. \n\nI hope for Pittsburgh this is not the case. Did I expect more from a Westin? Yes. Am I surprised? No.\n\nSub-par sushi. Tasted like takeout from Wegmans (holler, Rochester!). My Sauv Blanc was room temp & obviously an old bottle because it tasted nothing like it should (Kim Crawford is my standby so this was extra disappointing). Walk across the street & check out the Tonic Bar, I wish I had."	0
Stopped in for lunch. No greeter so we weren't sure where to go. Super expensive for the portions. My salad had dressing only in the center. The rest was dry. My sweet potato fries that came with breaded shrimp tasted BBQ-ish  weird. But the worst was that my breaded shrimp actually had a curly hair cooked into the bread ing. It was disgusting. The waitress apologized and offered to replace but my appetitive was gone by then. She however did not offer to comp the meal. I would absolutely not return nor recommend it to anyone. Way too overpriced and the hair was a disgusting unwanted bonus :-(	0
"In the lobby of the Westin. Service was friendly and exact. Good was excellent, especially since I thought it would be a mediocre \""hotel lunch\"" at best. Scallops with potatoes and corn hash and some lovely mushrooms as well. Cajun shrimp butter was fantastic too!"	1
Not good. I suspect the servers are over worked or spread too thin b/c the service sucked. The food was ok, but nothing special. It's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent.	0
We checked this out for lunch, since we were staying at the Weston.\n\nThe sushi, I thought, was pretty good.  Nothing outstanding, and I probably wouldn't seek it out again, but it wasn't bad.  My friends ordered other things off the menu; the verdict was largely that the food looked good, but was bland; this was especially apparently true of the fish sandwich.\n\nThe attached bar is *small* with a very limited selection of beers and liquors.  Perplexingly, they also have loads of bar seating, but don't open that area for happy hour time.  It seems you could not get appetizers and hang out until some point later in the evening.\n\nSuper expensive too.  Go somewhere else for lunch, there are many better options in the area.	0
I try to go here for lunch at least once a week. I believe it is the best lunch spot in the strip if not Pittsburgh. It's so good that it actually makes me smile thinking about it. I get the smoked salmon salad or the spicy thai wrap. I keep telling myself to branch out but they're such perfect lunches. Their cookies are delicious too. And the lady at the cash register is really nice! Absolute A+	1
Went here on a Monday at around 7:00.  The bar was filled with the usual suspects; guys in Brioni suits drinking away the stress, unfortunate weather and reality they have to head home to the wives who just dropped 3-5k at pottery barn.\n\nThe drinks were solid, and very fair priced (based on NY and Chicago pricing)  The open(ish) floor plan would accommodate a happy hour very well.  The food on the other hand - absolutely horrible.\n\nWe had lamb, chili prawns, ahi, chicken (something) and Chorizo.  The 'fusion' southern Spain meets some Japanese influenced small plates works, but the execution was deplorable.  \n\nVerdict: Drink but avoid the food at all costs...	0
SO disappointed with this place! I've been wanting to try it for some time and finally did and boy...what a letdown. I had heard that it was one of downtown's happening Happy Hour places, but on the Tuesday night I went, it was 99% empty. The menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average. The drinks weren't anything special either.  No innovation here in the food, drinks, or decor.	0
"Never been before and went on a Thursday night at 6PM before a show. Upon arriving, all the good seating near the windows was blocked off for private use (and remained unused). The \""host\"" told us to go find our own seating wherever we wanted. The setup is interesting with a large open bar area and a small number of tables around the perimeter. We took a seat at a table. The bar seating was fairly full with some milling around in the area and standing, and probably a total of 30 people there. We saw at least 5-6 staff, a couple sitting around playing on their phones.\n\nWe sat at our table for 20 minutes and never had a single person come by, not to say we will be there shortly, not to take a drink order, nothing. We could tell this wasn't going to be good so left and no one even noticed.\n\nIt was a little more bar than restaurant, so we weren't sad to leave."	0
"Girls looking for a sugar daddy, guys looking for a cougar, or if you're just a pretentious douche: Bossa Nova is the place for you.\n\nThe atmosphere is downright tragic for how hard it tries.  The bar prices scream to the proletariat: \""Let them drink beer down the street! We only want the bourgeois in here.\""  Even the DJ they had during the Gallery Crawl a few weeks back was tragic.  I mean I know that the DJ has to appease the sugar daddies and cougars but is every place in Pittsburgh required to have 80s music?  I'm sure it is in the liquor license application.\n\nThat said, the barstaff is generally friendly and very quick - most likely so you don't realize you just paid eight dollars for a beer."	0
"Extremely disappointed.    My wife and I walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating.   Okay, that's fine..... as we walk to find our table I'm wondering 'why don't the just have a sign there because she wasn't  very friendly, nor timely with the direction.'    That said, we sat down at a table set up for dining that was nicely presented.   Unfortunately we sat at the table for approximately five minutes without recognition from any employee at the restaurant.   At this point, we decided to dine elsewhere.   As we walked out, there was still not one bit of attention given, again.   The hostess never lifted her head from whatever she was reading.   I think that a sign would have served a much better purpose.   On the back side it could have said \""thanks for your business\"" .....or lack, there of."	0
Go to salsa night on Thursdays super FUN	1
The menu was small and underwhelming. The flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box. They didn't have the sauces, so the gave us ketchup to go with over cooked shrimp/bacon and extremely greasy fries.	0
This is a gret place to go if you like Martini's!  The food is pretty good and the decor is awesome!  There are always some randoms bartending and you're never sure if you'll get a hipster or old mother Hubbard, but they always serve great drinks!	1
Olive or Twist, a narrow bar tucked away in the Cultural District, has friendly service, reasonable prices, and pretty decent bar food.  While it's not a sports bar per se, it's a great place to watch a game... like Game 7 of the Stanley Cup.  Go Pens!!\n\nIf they renovated their bathrooms, they would definitely deserve a five-star rating.	1
We came downtown on a Sunday afternon before a show looking for cocktails, seemingly this was the only place open on a Sunday. Olive of Twist is very dark, but it makes for a nice date spot. They found a way to make exposed brick walls and large indsutrial fans classy.\n\nTheir cocktails are absolutely great, at the top of the list is a proper gin martini with an olive or twist. They may also make the best sidecars in Pittsburgh, but for $8 - $10 a drink you should expect as much.\n\nThe calmari was excellent and we'll keep them in mind for their extensive dessert menu.	1
Don't bother. \n\nWe were kind of desperate to find a place that wasn't too pricy and close to our hotel on a Monday night. We saw this place, with the low lighting and witty name (although we weren't sure if they're cleaver enough to make the theater reference or if it was simply a mistake).\n\nThey boast a new menu and I got the pasta with goat cheese and almonds. I didn't have high expectations but this was like family meal before your serving shift. It was boring and flavor free. My boyfriend got a steak sandwich that looked punny. Oh, and the grocery store wine was way over priced.\n\nBoo!	0
Love the atmosphere and martini menu here. Nothing like a Frosted Grape martini and exposed brick to make you feel like a class act. I've also enjoyed any sandwich or salad I've ever gotten here. Highly recommeded!	1
Nice surprise.\n\nExpecting bar food when looking for a quick dinner while in town on business from Florida, we were presently surprised by the variety and quality at a reasonable price. The Buffalo Chicken spread was a flavorful hummus fare served with pita bites that were wonderful while warm. I had the Ahi Tuna Taco Platter that was tasty as well. The house Merlot was short of the $9/glass price, but overall this was time and money well spent.	1
Sooo blacked out here that\nWe heckled the guitarist.\nNot sorry. He sucked.	1
I get it. It gets busy when you're a bartender/waitress sometimes. I've been there myself. But you can explain why things are late or why it takes nearly half an hour to pour a glass of wine without being incredibly rude and cold, and if you even say it with an apologetic smile, most customers will understand. Food was fine, won't go back for fear of the server.	0
Came here for drinks and appetizers while in Pittsburgh for the weekend. They have a lot of specialty martinis to choose from. I tried a few including the sparkling pomegranate and tiramisu - both really good. For appetizers, we shared the calamari and buffalo chicken dip. The calamari was served with some kind of teriyaki sauce which gave it lots of flavor - delicious. I liked how the buffalo chicken dip was served in a martini glass - it was good but nothing special. \n\nI thought the service was good.. we sat in the dining area and had someone waiting on us the entire time. We walked by the bar on our way out - it was crowded with several groups of people standing around the bar. I'm glad we were at a table.	1
"The genius of the \""Olive or Twist\"" name got us in the door here, but we didn't have the best experience with their mixers.\n\nWhile here, we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini.  The blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum. As a strong drink, it was good. However, the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink. For the cucumber basil martini, the basil is the primary flavor in the drink and kills any undertones of the cucumber. The sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing.\n\nIn addition to a cocktail menu, they also offer a reasonable selection of beers including microbrews."	0
Found you on Yelp and weren't disappointed. Very friendly waitstaff and good food (bar fare). Yummy desserts. The acoustics downstairs were terrible. Exposed brick everywhere and no noise dampening.  Not the best place for an intimate dinner or quiet conversation on the weekend. But a young, fun, party like atmosphere. Convenient to cultural district.	1
Love this place. Stiff martinis and cocktails, cheap drinks, good service, nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends. Classy crowd and much more mature, older, and professional crowd. There aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there, which is so great. Very nice place to wind down after a long day.	1
The cocktail menu options were mouth-watering. Great place to grab a drink with friends, especially on ladies' night out!	1
We were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel.  There were many other restaurants, but this place looked nice.  The atmosphere was nice, and if I was rating only for atmosphere I'd give it 4 stars.  However, I'm mainly rating their food and service.  We were greeted promptly, but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinks/food even though there weren't many people in the dining room.  \n\nI ordered the Traditional French Dip Sandwich and Fries.  I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst I've ever eaten. In fact, I couldn't finish it.  The meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap, glorified hot dog roll that was soggy.  It wasn't soggy from the Au Jus, but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason.  \n\nOverall, if I was going back to Pittsburgh in this area, I would stay far away from Olive or Twist.	0
I'm reviewing Olive Or Twist strictly as a weekday lunch person.  I haven't had drinks there, or been there during an evening or weekend rush.\n\nI absolutely love this place.  Its seating area is small - maybe seven or eight tables?  The lunch menu is delicious.  I get the grilled cheese and tomato soup every time, and it's perfect.  The friend I go with gets the French Dip and sings its praises all day long.\n\nThe prices are a bit on the high side - over $10 for lunch - but frankly, the food is so good I'm glad to pay the extra couple of dollars.  \n\nThe bartender is always the same guy when I go, and if he's the only one up front who has to seat me I get a distinctly unhappy vibe off him.  Killing him with kindness does not work.  Other than him, the staff seems great, and I'm happy to give them my business.	1
I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. \n\nI tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. \n\nFor reasons I truly can't explain, we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. We both threw down a brew nasty, paid and left. Unfortunately for Olive or Twist, the visit would probably be our last.\n\nOn a positive note, there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started. \n\n\nWhen it's all said and done, we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street. Probably a much safer bet for future endeavors.	0
Owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal.	0
This place is pretty good. The buffalo chicken spread and the jerked salmon are awesome. The service is always good especially at the bar. They have an upstairs lounge that is open for happy hour during the week. If you are looking to grab a few drinks after work with friends, the lounge upstairs is a good choice. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced with happy hour specials M-F. ($2 off all martinis and half price buffalo chicken spread)	1
My favorite bar in town love the live music and the martinis - fave is the strawberry shortcake!	1
This bar is cramped, overpriced, and the service is unbelievably slow. Happy Hour runs 4-6, so you'll show up at 5, have no place to sit or stand, and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours You'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5, even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times I've been there).\n\nSeriously, avoid this place. When one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour, direct them anywhere else.	0
Food was good, had scallops, ahi tuna salad and chicken wings which were all tasty and at a good price. Drinks were the highlight, try my favorites of the night, jalape\u00f1o Moscow mule and suit and tie.	1
I went here for a college alumni gathering on a Saturday, during the Three Rivers Art Fest. We were secluded in the upstairs area. I loved the atmosphere (very classy)  and the martinis (very unique and tasty). We dropped serious money on the drinks. We had a coupon from Foursquare for a free appetizer. I ordered the truffle fries, very delicious. I would recommend coming here for a cocktail or two, but if you're looking to put away some drinks, you could get more for your buck somewhere else. Then come here :)	1
So I decided to surprise my fianc\u00e9 one night by taking her here(because we've been talking about doing so for a while). We both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps. The martinis were just ok, and the food was very basic and nothing special. I will give the place another try and get some non appetizers next time and hope the bartender is a bit better at mixing the drinks.	0
This place is good for drink before and after shows. I always wanted to try their food, but haven't yet. They have lots of different martinis. I will be back.	1
This is my second time coming and I still love it and especially the Buffalo chicken spread! The atmosphere is a little dark for lunch time but over all it was a good experience.The service was also great.	1
At the request of a friend, we had a brief girls night out at Olive or Twist. My first impression was the outdated decor. The restaurant has carpet which I find off putting. The drink menu is extensive; but, with the exception of one person in my party, we each found our drinks far too sweet. I ordered the cucumber basil martini, which was so sweet I had to send it back. The food was mediocre. I ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done. And then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s. The music was so loud and so bad that my friends I left and headed down the street to Butcher and the Rye.	0
Fantastic martinis!!	1
"Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce, too.  I know it was only $4/$7 for a 6\""/12\"" sub, but it was pretty bad.  (I bought a 12\"", intending to take half home for later, but I wound up throwing the second half away, and I NEVER throw away food.)  \n\nAs a Italian grocery, it seems okay, but the attitudes are a little snippy, and it's a pretty grungy-looking place."	0
This place has the most heavenly smell!\n\nThe pepperoni bread is an absolute must.  I was disappointed that there was no jalapeno bread left, but what can I do?  The prices are fantastic.  $5 for a full loaf of pepperoni bread, in NYC that's easily $8 to $12.  I will stop here before going home every time.	1
$3.00 fresh baked Italian loaf, need I say more.  The Italian bread is so yummy and makes great bruschetta.  They bake their bread fresh daily and do not include any preservative so eat it quick!	1
Maybe it's nostalgia for the cigar but I thought he looked ridiculous. He bragged about a $4 pepperoni roll. There's a reason it cost that, because it wasn't very good. The sauce was disappointing. I wouldn't come here for anything.	0
The italian coldcut sub was a travesty! Lots of STALE bread with skimpy meat portions, and no hots or flavor. Bread better suited for pigeons than people. I can find better Italian sandwiches back home in Baltimore. We'll feed these to our dogs when we get home.  You get what you pay for. Avoid this tourist trap!	0
Pittsburgh Bound!  Part X\n\n(For Part IX, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/stamoolis-brothers-company-pittsburgh?hrid=8hA8rRHss2PRlroWujzT_Q)\n\nThe Sunseri name is famous in Pittsburgh, and although their small alcove of Italian meats and bread is one of the smaller storefronts in the Strip, their pepperoni bread is melt in your mouth, filled with great mozzarella cheese.  I grabbed a loaf and we picked at it while we walked around.  My mom and I inhaled half of it without blinking an eye.\n\nIf you are going to get a loaf of Sunseri's pepperoni bread, I would suggest not doing it on an empty stomach.\n\n(For Part XI, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/primanti-brothers-pittsburgh?hrid=k97SGRvnhBMrHzqofs1WNg)	1
Well, folks, it's a transit system.  It's job is to get you from point A to point B and PAT does reasonably well at it.  I ride the 61A or the 61B (whichever comes first) to work.  My husband and I also use it when going to the Pirates or Penguins games or to the theater.  It's cheaper than gas and parking.	1
"First time in Pittsburgh, from Chicago. \n\n1. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WORKS.\n2. What is with the silly system of paying on your way out sometimes? It seems like the dumbest idea ever.\n3. Where are the reloadable transit cards?\n4. Why are the conductors so incredibly angry?\n5. Why do I need to request a stop on the \""T\""?\n\nOf the public transportation systems I've used, this is definitely the most confusing so far. Even if the website had an easier to understand fare explanation.\n\nLearn from the CTA. I have a new appreciation for Chicago Transit Authority."	0
Fares keep going up. Another service cut this month. I think I'd rather walk to work in the middle of the night!	0
"I would give it a \""1-star\"" review but the caption under \""2-star\"" is more like it, \""Meh.  I've experience better.\""\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with PAT.  The buses are unreliable timing wise and a majority of the drivers are jerks.  From having to be 10 minutes early (I shouldn't have to play it safe!) to being prepared to wait for a couple buses since rush hour means over crowded buses ... PAT is like a powder keg.  You just never know when its going to blow up on your commute.\n\nI do ride the bus daily.  And yes, it would take me the exact amount of time to drive in/out to work.  So honestly ... I treat PAT like I treat Airplane travel.  I get there when I get there ... as lone as I get there safely the on-time part is something I have learned to stop prioritizing as long as I'm riding a PAT bus.  ((Seriously tho, there's something wrong about having to make that concession!!))"	0
Last night marked the second time in a week that I waited 30 minutes or more for a 71B in the freezing cold rain.   I was 5 minutes early for the bus I was trying to catch.  I can understand a delay during rush hour, but this was not.  The bus was running every 20 minutes both times, according to the PAT schedule. When I gave up last night and went into my apartment, it was an additional 10 minutes before the bus went by...So let's review: I waited a total of 45 minutes for a bus that was supposed to be coming past every 20 minutes.  For shame!\n\nFrom now on, I'll be hoofing it across the East End instead of buying a bus pass.  It will be cold, but at least I'll be moving.	0
Don't ever get too comfortable with PAT--- they end up swiping everything out from under your feet, and then charging you a crapload for it.  I can't believe they're slashing more routes, and charging more!  Why would I pay you for continual service downgrades?!!?  You're not even offering a bus to the airport anymore here soon--- Do you know how many people ride that bus to WORK at/around the airport.  I tell you what.... Whoever runs your company is A DUMBASS to the 10th degree.\n\nGet your shit together.  Seriously.  Id rather walk from my work downtown, to my home in Oakland (thats an hour walk, and MORE than a mile) while Im 8 months pregnant,  than pay you assholes to take me home. \n\n\nP.S. I didnt even want to give it ONE star.	0
Well, it does get one from point A to point B in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut it's expensive, at least compared to the Metro Transit in Minneapolis that I'm used to. On Port Authority, it's $2.25 for a ticket, and an extra $1 for a transfer (which only gets you on one more bus, not all the way to your destination if it requires a bunch of transfers.) Coming from a maximum of $3 for two and a half hours of bus rides (express bus during rush hour), Port Authority is steep. I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.\n\nThere's no day pass. Boo. If you're traveling a lot throughout the day, it adds up fast without some sort of pass.\n\nAlso, the 28X doesn't pick up passengers coming from downtown into Oakland (or drop them off in the reverse direction.) Very frustrating, especially with a Megabus terminal only three blocks away from one of the stops. (There's also Greyhound and Amtrak downtown, if I remember correctly.)	0
A BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT\n\n\nI am concerned with the future of Port Authority, will Pittsburgh continue to have bus service as we know it?\nPort Authority constantly causes me a great deal of anxiety.  I have been riding the bus for as long as I can remember. We never had a car in my family. Now I am starting to feel like I've taken the bus for granted.\n\nI have a license but I choose not to drive...because I work Downtown and the cost of renting a parking space Downtown is HIGH!!! \n\nAnyway Port Authority to sum it up, is a hot damn mess.  How could I have forgotten? \nI have been shut in bus doors by ignorant, rude, nasty bus drivers Twice!!! \n\nAnd when it happen the first time, the bus drive wouldn't even apologize to me, \nThe bus drivers are a miserable bunch, just down right rotten,	0
I don't understand why Pittsburghers routinely put up with the idiocy that is our public transportation system.  Port Authority of Allegheny County is public transportation with massive, severe, permanent brain damage.  Unreliable, buses routinely don't come at all during heavy commuting times (like when you're trying to get to work on time), many of the drivers are assholes, the fare doubled in a decade and the service was cut in half.  The county refuses to fund it.  Getting on and off is confusing.  When to pay is confusing.  The schedules are hard to read.  The service isn't frequent enough.  The subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown.  This is horrible and it's one of the main things keeping Pittsburgh from being as great a city as it can be.  Call center people are sometimes rude and mostly unresponsive.  What else?  The buses smell like urine.  Sucks, sucks, sucks.  I live 3 miles from downtown and I commute by walking every day, to and from, because Port Authority of Allegheny County buses suck that bad.	0
If you like filthy buses, super high fares and about 50% rude operators then you will love Port Authority service.  Now if you like clean buses, reasonable fares and friendly service you will need to go somewhere else.  And no place for children as the language on the buses would make a sailor blush.  And in 14 years of riding Port Authority I have never seen a uniformed Port Authority officer riding a bus.	0
Awful!!!\nNever EVER follows schedule! Lets you wait for literally over an hour on a bus that is supposed to be running every 15 min.	0
Port Authority of Allegheny County employs some very, very bad drivers.\n\nA driver deliberately cut me off a few minutes ago on Liberty Avenue downtown. Further, the driver did not express that he was sorry for cutting me off and forcing me to swerve into oncoming traffic. \n\nThe driver is a middle-aged man. He was driving the G2 bus. The bus number is 5525. \n\nI will call the Port Authority in a few minutes to lodge my complaint; however, I wanted to lodge it here too for two reasons. First, the complaint bears on the Port Authority's ability to keep its riders safe (because the driver almost caused an accident, which could have resulted in injuries to the riders of the bus). Second, if this driver causes an accident in the future, I hope this complaint will help injured parties make a case for negligent retention or negligent supervision against the Port Authority.	0
Officials estimated about 400,000 people would be in downtown for the 4th of July.  I wish someone had informed the Port Authority of this.  Maybe then they would have had more than one bus running every 20 minutes after the fireworks.  Every single bus stop in downtown had about 300 people waiting for the already overcrowded buses.  If a bus actually did stop (some were so full, they just drove by), fights would break out over who of the 300 people would get one of four standing room only spots on the bus.	0
How is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway, but can't update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at? I waited two hours today in the freeZing cold to get to work. Had to call off it was just to cold out!	0
Need to get to Mass on a holy day of obligation?  This church is the perfect place.  On Holy Days they offer a multitude of Mass times so you can get to Mass and still get to work for the day.  I really like that they have a Mass early enough to still get me to work by 7:30.  They also have noontime Masses and even early evening.\n\nThe parish is welcoming and Mass has always been liturgically correct with relevant homilies.\n\nThe interior is simple, but their is beauty in that simplicity.  Glad to have an easily accessible church downtown!	1
"Ah...Jo Jo's.  What can I say?  Forget Primanti's at 2 AM.  I'm no fan of starch on my sandwich and I fully expect (and invite) the crush of Pittsburgh haters that will say that I am blaspheming.  I just don't like a whole meal on my bread.  Lettuce, tomato, appropriate condiment and meat.  You say \""weirdo\"" and I say \""renaissance chick\"".  Anyhoo, this review is constructed from the few drunken moments I can remember from when I went, but I do recall the comfort of the wooden pews, the waitress patient with drunkards, great scenery from the other drunks, staggering in and out.  The food was large and in charge and sufficiently greasy to make sure you could function the next day.  I feel that grease and hooch battle it out in my tummy and grease always wins.  I got a booty call and subsequently had my order wrapped to go, which the waitress was really great about.  Turns out I probably should have stayed at Jo Jo's!  ;-)"	1
4.5 stars????   Really?????  Based on what?   The food is okay, but not great; standard breakfast diner fare.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are all right for what you get.  What I found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating.  The seats at the counter were torn and tilting off the base.  The booths were fast-food style: hard and tight.  It's as if they designed the seating to be uncomfortable so that you wouldn't linger.	0
Clearly based on other reviews, I should try this during daylight hours. \n\nWe went after a long night out, landing there around 2:30. I've been to plenty of late night places, after-hour bars, etc, but I've never been as scared as I was at Jo-jo's. \n\n2 fights broke out while we were there. First a group of guys, then their girlfriends. Then a guy at the next table threw up on the ground -some splashing on my leg. \n\nThen we heard police sirens and the fights were escalating - so we bolted. Maybe this is a rare experience? Anyway - I won't be heading back anytime soon!	0
Been going Labad's since childhood.  Very nice guys - they act like they can be your uncles!\n\nThe place hasn't changed since the late 80s.  Excellent food and well stocked groceries.\n\nIf you have never been to the Penn Avenue district of Pittsburgh, you are doing yourself a great disservice.	1
Trust a man with an epic mustache. \n\nMade a stop here to pick up ingredients for a Middle Eastern lentils and rice dish; Mustache Man taught me the name of the dish in Arabic and gave me detailed instructions on how to cook it. He recommended the best bulk rice (basmati) and the best bulk lentils (green) for the dish and now I just want to stop in casually to ask him how his weightlifting is going!\n\nThe sliced almonds I bought at Salem's in North Oakland had bugs in them; The ones I bought here did not. Another plus.	1
I like this place. So far I have tried the hummus and the falafel, it was good. I  lived in Israel, so I have eaten my fair share of middle eastern cuisine. The only feedback I have is that the store looks a bit dirty. I think that could be a turnoff to some.... I think they could do a few things to freshen the place up and make it known they serve food, I think they would get more business this way, and people would not miss out on the great middle eastern cuisine. The man at the front desk is very kind as well.	1
This was the worst service I have ever gotten, the employee at the airport avis center stole money from us. We were trying to rent a car in the airport and we thought the price was too expensive, so we asked her not to swipe the card while we confirmed that we wanted this price while we leave she swipes our card. And what happened we are 3500$ short. \n\nAlso the prices are really bad here, for one car the price with insurance was 3500$ while at enterprise is 1700$. \n\nWe still haven't gotten our money back and now we have no money in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania. Avis customer service says we have to wait 72 hours. Thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars. \n\nNever go here.	0
Very friendly service and a nice selection at this restaurant supply store. This is a small business, so they don't have every kitchen item that you might want, but they have a lot of things, and commercial-grade quality. I picked up a hefty polypropylene cutting board on my last visit. Vastly superior to the department store versions. Fair prices, too.	1
i find i can no longer be a customer at salon christine. christine's conduct/attitude toward me regarding my valid question about aveda products possibly reverting back to animal testing was rude, unprofessional, and insulting. not only did she not respond to my facebook question on her salon's page, but only after an email to her, did she reply with a curt answer, and to add insult to injury, she's banned me from further posting/commenting on the salon's facebook page. i didn't realize an inquiry regarding a product for which i'm paying wasn't permitted. instead of setting the record straight (which should've been done), she elected to ignore my question, delete it from facebook, and then ban me from the salon's page. wow. that said, i'll really miss katie, as she's a great hairstylist and colorist.	0
I purchased a gift certificate up front from them only to find out that they were never going to let me use it.    I kept calling to try to make appointments and each time I called, the staff was rude and said that they had no appointments.    My gift certificate expired because they never had any appointments available (or so they said) and when I explained my situation to them over the phone, they were extremely rude.    I said that I would tell my friends and family about my awful experience there and about how they took my money but never provided services to me.    The staff said something extremely rude to me over the phone and then hung up.\n\nI will never give this salon my money again.     It's a shame that I'm out 50 bucks and have nothing to show for it.     I was scammed.	0
We made a trip to Pittsburgh a month back and a friend of mine insisted that we get a sandwich from Primanti's.  It was everything I'd hoped for.  I had a roast beef.  It was topped with slaw and fries and I threw a little hot sauce in there.\n\nWash it down with an Iron City.	1
Hey a sandwich with the fries and slaw inside served on a wax paper sheet and tasty (maybe a little bland, may have not chosen the best type) but would go back in a second.	1
Here's how you can make your own Primanti Bros Sandwich at home:\n\nTake two slices of Italian Bread, between them, mash together bland cole slaw, fries, some assorted meat, tomatoes. And at your fingertips is Pitt's pride and joy.  I'm not from here, so maybe I don't share the love. We weren't really drunk when we were eating here, and it was in the middle of the day. \n\nThe service was pretty slow, but when our order was taken, the sandwich came out very fast.\n\nIt was a good sandwich in terms of having really hot meat, and cold tomatoes and cole slaw, but I didn't think its as tasty as it could have been.\n\nI think the bread should be buttered and toasted/grilled texas toast, and they should use seasoned fries. Use some sweet North Carolina style Cole slaw. \nI came, I saw, and I conquered, but I'm giving it back. I probably won't be back ever again.	0
"I must admit that not being from Pittsburgh, I walked into this place with very different expectations for what a \""cheesesteak\"" sandwich constituted. Having said that, while the inclusion of an enormous amount of fries and coleslaw on the sandwich was great, the tiny piece of beef \""patty\"" that can only be described as something they use as a weight watchers/jenny craig portion leaves much to be desired. I honestly felt like I was eating some sort of vegetarian sandwich with a tiny piece of shriveled up beef patty lost somewhere in between the enormous slices of Italian bread.\n\nOn the plus side, the Oakland location does have a pretty sweet deal for after 10pm, where a sandwich and drink was 3 or 4 bucks."	0
I was out of town in Pittsburgh, and I was told this was the place to go to get the PA experience.  The meal started off pretty well with $2 Yuenglings and amazing chili, cheese, sour cream and bacon fries.  However, things took a turn for the worse when the famous sandwiches came out.  Two of us had the turkey and one had the colossal fish.  I thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird.  The fries added almost no flavor to the sandwich, and the cole slaw was gross.  The bread was terrible, and overall, the sandwich made me nauseous.  Totally not worth it, unless you just go for the fries and drinks.	0
The sandwiches here are massive.  Whatever you order winds up between two pieces of bread which seems both wrong and logical.  Regardless it is a mighty fine sandwich.  I wish I could get one right now...	1
This place is lengendary so naturally as a tourist - I had to go. I can sum it up in one word YUM!! Staff was friendly as we sat at the bar and watched the cook in action. I have never had a sandwich quite like that with a coleslaw like substance and fries on it, but I'd gladly eat it again. Lively fun place with people to match. Great for a quick casual bite.	1
"Primanti's sandwiches pretty much sum up Pittsburgh in many ways:  big, over-the-top, tasteless, and unhealthy.  What more could you ask for? Unfortunately, this place is pretty dirty.  Make sure no flies land on your food.\n\nIt seems like Pittsburgh natives love this place, which is fine.  Its food certainly is unique.  However, if you're not from Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll walk away with a rather bland taste in your mouth.\n\nBy the way, do not pronounce the \""t\"" in Primanti.  It really irks native Pittsburghers.  It's pronounced \""Primanny.\""  Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way."	0
As a visitor to Pittsburgh, I certainly can't claim to understand the nuances of the local culture.  But Primanti Bros., aside from being at the top of everyone's recommendation list for places to eat, just oozes personality, and to boot, it's a fun place to just chill and get a damn good meal.\n\nThe whole french-fries-and-coleslaw-stuffed-into-a-sandwich thing would only be gimmicky if it weren't freakin' delicious.  It's impossible to look cute and shove one of these things into your mouth at the same time... although perhaps that's the idea.\n\nNow I just have to try all the locations and figure out which one is the best of the best.	1
The food was just OK. Soggy french fries on a greasy cheese steak pattie.  The service was awful, noise, and not helpful for a newcomer to Primantis and Pittsburgh.	0
Stopped in here while passing through Pittsburgh without knowing anything about the city or this establishment. Like gnats, we were attracted to Primati because their neon sign was... pretty.... soooooo pretty!\n\nAnyway, stopped in here and order the Pittsburgh cheesesteak which was quite tasty. We also got the Cajun chicken sandwich with cheese... because everything there comes with cheese. Everything. Need salt? Even that has cheese on it. It's kinda awesome.\n\nAnyway, both sandwiches were quite tasty and with the fries on top... yummy.  Would definitely come back here next time I'm coming through Pittsburgh, hopefully for longer than a few hours.	1
We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp, hoping to get a real taste of Pittsburgh. What I ordered was a sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat, cole slaw, and mediocre fries, on white bread. The sandwich was very small, but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway, and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.\n\nI was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King. Luckily we had a nice lunch at Salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths.	0
Worst sandwich on Earth.\nI'd rather eat a dead whore.\nPlease...never come here.	0
Primanti Bros is basically the heart of all yinzers in Pittsburgh. However, I have to take primanti bros in doses. Their big ass sandwiches make me feel like I dont need to eat the rest of the week. Sometimes I love it for that and sometimes I hate it. Either way its a nice place to sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice cold beer with my friends. \n\n My only complaint about this particular primanti bros in market square is the people that it generates. Anywhere from hookers to crackheads. I have been in there several times and atleast 4 or 5 times I watched someone get kicked out for doing something illegal. My advice is, if you can, go to this primantis during the day for lunch dont go at night. If you can go to the one in the strip district or southside on 17th street.	0
"While the Downtown location doesn't have the extensive menu that the suburban locations have, any Primanti Brothers location will fill u up with one of the most unique sandwiches in the nation. Highly recommend the new Black Angus sandwich over the traditional \""No 2 Best Seller\"" ... or go with Capicola and Egg. Both delicious!"	1
oh primanti's, you always disappoint! how can so much food bear so little taste? despite a brilliant premise (put all your edibles in the sandwich, leave your other hand free for the potables) the execution leaves much to be desired.\n\n1. these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly. they are always greasy on the outside, raw and mealy on the inside. don't think that just because they're INSIDE the sandwich doesn't mean you can get away with crappy fries.\n\n2. the bread. what the heck dudes? if you're going to put 3 lbs of ingredients in the sandwich, try to use a bread that doesn't immediately turn into insipid play-doh in your hands.\n\nI like disgusting junk food as much as anyone (see my rave review of the O), but I wish the primanti's goons would put a little bit more effort into their sandwiches. seriously guys -- take some pride in your work and make something good for once. and check the thermostat on your fryolator already!	0
well you gotta give this place a star for its originality. coleslow and fries in your sandwich.. sound good? its actually pretty intresting. the coleslaw isn't creamy its a big vinegry, so it doesn't soak ur sandwich. fries are good too, if eat them fast enough. i had the pastrami sandwich.......dude... YUM! its super good. the steak wasnt' so great though, i shouldn't have traded half my sandwich. its one of the better sandwiches i can remember eating. the place is packed though, and there was a steelers game going on, ive never seen so many steelers fans before. crazy. but this place is good, its cheap, and you get a crazy lot amount. eat here!	1
I'm gonna get slaughtered for giving this place a bad review, but whatever. \n\nI was told by several people that I absolutely HAD to check out Primanti Bros while I was in Pittsburgh. I was excited about visiting this institution during my stay... but it really didn't deliver for me. \n\nYes, this was a huge sandwich with fries and cole slaw in it, but the sheer quantity of food didn't make up for the fact that it was really bland. Maybe I just got the wrong thing (the Pittsburger Cheese Steak - which is somehow their #2 seller...?). My friend liked her sandwich, which was eggs and bacon, I believe. Maybe we just went to the wrong Primanti Bros location. \n\nI would give this place another shot if I'm ever in town again, but my first impression wasn't a great one.	0
GROSS!!! Many people told me to go here and I was totally disappointed! It was bland, the coleslaw was too tangy (and only contained cabbage) and the meat was scary! Good thing it's super cheap. Do NOT get the cheese-steak sandwich if you go even though it says #2 best seller, it's awful! \n\nOkay on to service... Everyone seemed like they hated their job. Someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onions.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day... Who knows.	0
i love coming to pittsburgh solely for these sandwiches.  get a different one each time but they are to die for.  my new favorite is the capicola and egg.  i mean anything with fries and coleslaw on it can't be beat.  easily the best cole slaw i've ever had as well.	1
"Alright, I heard about this chain on Man v. Food and we just had to try it out. And honestly, we were quite disappointed. The sandwich is tasteless unless you douse it with condiments or get a particularly flavorful filling. I got the cheese one and my boyfriend got the colossal fish (both vegetarians--its not so friendly for us...fail). Neither sandwich was impressive--in size or taste. I'm a 5\""4' and 120lb girl and I finished mine no problem. Just incredibly bland. The bread tasted like cheap white bread, the fries were just incredibly greasy, the cole slaw was hardly cole slaw and more like wet cabbage. The cheese on mine was basically tasteless and my boyfriends fish was definitely from a box of something frozen. Very disappointing."	0
Everyone that comes to Pittsburgh must try Primanti Bros at least once. I have been there multiple times but this is my first review of the place. The sandwich is something to see and eat especially after a night of drinking. The original location is definitely the best especially for the people watching aspect. \n\nI chose the sandwich with bacon and cheese and it was definitely consistent with the other times I have been there, but I will say this after you have gone once you will never need to go back unless its late and you need something to soak up the alcohol.	1
My family always wanted to try Primanti. What a huge disappointment at the Anchor drive one. The pizza was served with a mound of burnt ashes on the bottom. Not a little, but teaspoons of it, all over. The ovens are not cleaned. I ordered the fish sandwich which came out cold, a soppy mess from the oil on the bread and a chunk of coleslaw core inedible. My sons was no better. The waitress saw we had taken only one bite and asked if we wanted to take home. We both said 'no way.' She didn't flinch and didn't care. I don't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid. In Philly, they'd be out of business in a heartbeat. It is also a dirty, noisy unkempt premises.	0
"There were French fries on my sandwich!\nThis is my first time in PA, so I wasnt sure what to expect when we were sent to Market Square for \""the greatest sandwich in the world!\""\n\nThe prices were dead on - about 6$ for a sandwich and 1.5$ for a tea.  I split a ham and cheese with my friend and we both left full.  I had the cole slaw (which was more like sauerkraut) and it was yummy.\n\nI am docking them a star because the service was less than desirable, even after the lunch rush ended."	1
As good as advertised.  The sandwiches are big with quality cuts of meat.  I thought the slaw was delicious too adding a little vinegary tang to the fries.  Great atmosphere and friendly wait staff,	1
Oh so good and huge! Each sandwich is both tasty and large enough to feed two normal folks for lunch.\n\nAt the suggestion of the server, I ordered the Kolbassi Sandwich. It came fast and was oh so good! Also free soda refills.\n\nService was good mid afternoon on a weekday, and I enjoyed the whole experience watching the NFL Hall of Fame induction ceremony on the flatscreens while eating.	1
Okay, I'm a heretic. I'm prepared to be stoned by the fundamentalists.\n\nA native sent me here, an apparent Pittsburgh landmark. My wife and I are not cole slaw fans, so we ordered our hot sausage sandwich sans slaw.\n\nWhat I got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich. The fries were lifeless and the hot sausage was not not. The bread was devoid of texture and flavor.\n\nSo, yeah, I didn't order it The Way It's Supposed To Be. Maybe if you're into cole slaw, this is the place to go, but if you don't, keep walking. Service was indifferent, at best.	0
My first time at Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh, PA.  I was not impressed with my sandwich there.  I've only been once so maybe I ordered the wrong thing but it just wasn't blowing my skirt up.\n\nI ordered the corned beef sandwich with the fries and slaw and it tasted a little bland to me.  It needed some sauce.  I think with some mustard this might have been great.  It was dry.  I did enjoy the cole slaw.\n\nThe service was fast and the server we had was very friendly and attentive.	0
After sitting there and being ignored for 25 minutes we just left!	0
I'm with others here - not a lover of Primanti Bros.  Sandwiches are fine (I have ordered the turkey and cheese) but the service is horrible.  Rude, arrogant, and just nasty.  Plus when is the last time a broom has been taken to the floors?  (I'm reviewing the Monroeville one here).	0
"Decided to try the place since I heard about it and is listed in things to do in Pittsburgh. This place is really connected to Pittsburgh itself and Conan even mentioned it in one of his shows as a place to eat at.\n\nOrdered the \""2nd most popular\"" item which was the cheesesteak that was very, very plain. Nothing great about the patty. The thing was HUGE and stacked with fries and coleslaw which I found didn't work well (although there are others out there that do it with success!)\n\nYou can't deviate and ask for it without the coleslaw either and their menu stated it as \""All of our sandwiches come with...\""\n\nThe portions are huge, one order can feed 2 average appetites.  \n\nThe fries were the only upside of this place.\n\nThe service here is horrible.. there was 2 people running the place and our tables werent clean and it takes forever.. I don't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place.\n\nI don't think I will ever go back again."	0
When I told people I was going to Pittsburgh, everyone recommended Primanti Bros. I went and was underwhelmed. It was a big sandwich, but the flavour was not amazing. I also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me. As a Chicago native, I feel it's the equivalent of people recommending Giordano's or Portillo's. They're not exactly the greatest places in town, but they're well-known and popular for one reason or another. Do it just to say you did.\n\nI don't like coleslaw.	0
I am still trying to figure out how to transport a few sandwiches back on the plane.....There is just something about Pittsburgh and their traditional comfort food!  I have addicted my husband.	1
eh.\n\nGo here once to say you did. You'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it. It will be pretty huge. That is all.\n\nI might go back to check out the nightlife. I'll update my review then.	0
The original place in the Strip District is the best by far. Capicola & Cheese is my fav and though I'm not a fan of cole slaw, the fact that it's a dry slaw does it for me.  Bring your appetite and leave your attitude at the door.	1
Based on what I've read on yelp, I tried the Pastrami.  The cole slaw, fries, meat, and the italian bread all came together in a really HUGE sandwhich that was really good for a few reasons.  Flavor, texture, quantity, and presentation.  Ordered a couple of Yuenglings to wash it all down...not bad.	1
I understand Primanti is a historic institution here in Pittsburgh but other than the name I don't think it has much going on unless you're in the mood for quantity versus quality. I got reeled into my experience because everyone said to try it when I moved here. Really simple menu as you just choose the meat you'd like in your sandwich. I went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw, tomato, french fries and bread was just okay and made it soggy as I finished the second half. The sheer size of it all was just too much too. I wouldn't return again, though if you're visiting and into doing Pittsburgh touristy stuff I would say you would need to experience Primanti to judge for yourself.	0
Maybe the expectations were too high, but I had a pastrami sandwich and I thought it was quite bland. The only flavors were vinegar and pepper. It was better with hot sauce, but I expected better.	0
I heard from everyone that the Primanti sandwiches are the quintessential Pittsburgh food. \n\nWe scored a nice seat outside and indulged in some Iron Hill beer that was on special for $2 for a  20 oz beer. The sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive.\n\nBe warned that everything here comes with french fries, even the salads.	0
"Wildly overrated.  I compare it to Pat's and Geno's in Philly, good when your drunk, but only when your drunk.\n\nI went to Pitt for 4 years and I have to say I never understood the Primantis hype.  I dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck.  They are soggy and tasteless, maybe the worst I've ever had.  I will say the coleslaw is pretty good, and I'm not usually a coleslaw guy, but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings.  \n\nHalf the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The \""cheesesteak\"" might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.  \n\nPrimantis sucks...go to Fatheads on the Southside or Uncle Sam's in Oakland."	0
Really bad service. Make sure to get in the face of the wait staff or count on being ignored	0
I've been here a handful of times, and I don't think I could ever get bored of their sandwiches.  Everything was reasonably-priced, and the sandwiches were gigantic and delicious.\n\nI've never had a wait here, nor have I ever had bad service.  I remember they had a fair selection of beers as well.\n\nLook, you're not going to Primanti's for five-star filet mignon, posh decorations and furnishing and waiters in black ties and suits.\n\nYou're going to Primanti's for a big manly sandwich that gets right to the chase.  Easy in, easy out...your taste buds will be delighted...and you'll leave with a full belly.\n\nThat's what you're getting here.	1
I love this place. Their sammies are awesome. I am not a coleslaw fan but like it and choose to eat it here. The pictures below describe it nicely. It's a sandwhich with coleslaw and french fries on it. It may not sound right but it's excellent. The service isn't the best but it's usually because they are verrrry busy. It's not your healthiest place but hey, who cares.	1
Mmmmmm, so much deliciousness. Cole slaw and fries on top of food that will elicit a chorus \u00e0 la Handel's Messiah from any drunkard worth her salt. \n\nGlasses of beer that won't stop urging you to take a gander at their naked bottoms.  \n\nAll the goodness of tasty food that compels writers to make exclusive use of fragmented sentences.\n\nI wanted to have an orgy with all the Primanti Brothers as a token of my gratitude, but since I almost fainted due to claustrophobia in the narrow stairwell on my way to the pissah, I suppose a thank you will just need to suffice.	1
This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  \n\nThe restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me.	0
Primanti's is a Pittsburgh institution.  The original is in the strip district just outside of downtown proper.  They are famous for large sandwiches with the fries IN the sandwich, not on the side.  Idea was born out of truckers wanting a meal they could eat on the road.  Yes, if you are in PIT you should probably go once just to say you've been there.  That being said, I have been a number of times and tried a number of different sandwiches and to be honest they all were fairly bland.  Lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion.	0
Stopped at the Market Square Primanti's this weekend after a Pirates game.  Salami sandwich was out of this world, and the 24 oz. IC Light wasn't too shabby, either.  Great post-10pm food!	1
I really don't know what the hype is about.  I was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant.	0
ate at the one in North Versailles. floor filty, all young kids running the place, poor service, poorly made sandwich, very bad overall. The should have a manager on duty. I wont be back. thanks	0
I was very excited to go here because of all the buzz about this place.  To be honest this place was not that good at all.  The sandwiches, although unique, were not that good. It was all french fries and very little meat.  My husband and I were almost mad at how little meat was on the sandwiches.  We won't be going back but at least we experienced it.	0
So this is a Pittsburgh instiitution??  Am so underwhelmed.  After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches), they came out cold - and I'm not just talking about the meat, lettuce, tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.  What a disappointment.  Head to DiBellas - much better service, subs and sandwiches.	0
Underwhelming is one word that comes to mind. The meat tasted cheap, the fries were soggy and the sandwich as a whole was pretty tasteless.\nMaybe my expectations were just too high, I don't know. I went bc I had to, but I definitely will skip next time I'm in town.	0
Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster, tasteless food.\n\nAte at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9), but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory, bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.\n\nWe also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day, but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning, explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.\n\nThe legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here, but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch.	0
I am a foodie so when I travel, I must try foods that are famous in the city that I visit. So, Primati Bros is a must on my Pittsburgh trip. Well, I was not disappoint after eating their #2 almost famous pittsburger.  Next time, I will try the pastrami. My friend had the pastrami, and it looked tastier.	1
"There was basically no cheese on my \""cheese combo sandwich\"", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us."	0
"Boring sandwich. Period. I fell for the \""hype\"" and while it was filling for $7 bucks, it just did not satisfy a craving...I had the corned beef."	0
At first I didn't like this place. I tried a few sandwiches and liked the Pittsburgh classic idea more than the actual food. I was about to give up when I tried the roast beef. It's my sandwich every time I go now. I'll be back.	1
"People knock on this place - but I always find myself defending it. \n\nWhile it may be overrated for being featured on the food network, it is a pretty good sandwich place (no not just because the portions...while they are generous) \n\nThe fries are a bit bland but I'm a huge fan of the cole slaw they have there - while it may not be anything \""special\"" it's a classic (not creamy cole slaw mind you). The colossal fish sandwich is pretty good. The cheese steak is not a cheese steak! But that's because I'm from Philadelphia and any cheese steak that isn't made and prepared there is not a cheese steak to me. \n\nThe only thing is the sanitation there is...questionable.  Just don't think about the sticky surfaces and slimy-ish floors. \n\nFor a cheap, giant sandwich I'd take the germs any day."	1
Good beer and food was really good but the service was mediocre at best. But I love that I can here the game and not random music by Rihanna	1
Solid place for a Yuengling and a greasy sandwich. Try the Pittsburgher, a cheesesteak with a heaping helping of cole slaw and fries. A Pittsburgh institution, something that's worth checking out before leaving town.	1
Years ago I saw Primanti Bros. on the food network while I lived in Ohio. I promised myself that when given the opportunity to try them I would.  I came on a lovely Friday afternoon so all the out door tables were taken. We came inside and sat at the bar. I ordered the bacon sandwich (bacon, fries, cole slaw and a fried egg) while my friend had the colossal fish sandwich. There was some SERIOUS bacon on my sammich! I was taken aback since so many places are stingy with bacon. My sandwich was over indulgent and amazing. I only ate half but took the rest home.	1
You can't go to Pittsburgh and not get Primanti Bros.  For my fellow Detroiters it's like not going to Coney Island when friends are in town.    \n\nSandwiches are great - all of them come with coleslaw and frenchfries (ON the sandwich).  They have a full bar at this location.   It was in the high 80's with high humidity so a Blue Moon went perfect with our meals.	1
Disappointed, big time.\n\nLocal info lauds this place as an institution.\n\nI say: pass.  The sandwich was soggy, bland, and just all-around not good.\n\nI didn't get sick from it, so that's a bonus.  \n\nChoose wisely.  Go to Meat & Potatoes instead, and order a sandwich there.	0
"My sister-in-law, husband, and I visited this Primanti Bros from all the hype we'd been hearing about it. I have to say its overrated. I wasn't impressed with my sandwich at all. I ordered the chicken breast, my hubby got the fish, and my SIL got the steak. It had thick white bread, an overload of cole slaw, and fries. I don't think the \""meat\"" you order makes a difference in the bland taste, as it's overpowered by the slaw and fries. The bread was dry on the crust and yet soggy from the slaw/oil from fries. The wait staff wasn't friendly either. They seemed to have the \""I don't need try to so hard because we're busy no matter what\"" attitude. We had to go up to the bar to get refills on our drinks after waiting over 10 min. for the waitress to notice we were out. The place was constantly busy due to the full bar and nostalgic feel of the restaurant; it had it's own local charm. I'm glad to say I tried it, however I probably wouldn't go back on our next visit."	0
Nice menu and good service \nI recommend	1
This joint makes excellent sandwiches. \n\nI ordered the fish sandwich and it was delicious! First off, its huge, and cheap. They stuff the sandwiches with cole slaw and fries (yummy). \n\nYou really can't go wrong here. \n\nThe place is usually packed to the brim, so you need to get in early before it gets full, which it will. Once it gets busy, the service gets worse. \n\nIf you're in the area, its definitely worth a try.	1
Had lunch here while visiting friends in the area .... After seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows I was very excited to eat hear . WOW ,,, what a dissapointment , This place is so over hyped it isnt funny . To compare this place to the famous sandwich places is NYC is a joke . The sandwiches may be big , but only because they are over stuffed with fries and cole slaw . To steal a line from a old TV commercial .... WERE'S THE BEEF .....  A major major dissapointment .	0
If you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them, go for it.   But no good sandwich needs nonsense like that.  These are not very good sandwiches to begin with and adding soggy fries doesn't help.  Not to mention the bread is not fresh and is just a thick, bland wonder-bready thing.  \n\nI appreciate that they're not aiming at  customers like me.  Big sloppy sandwiches are fun for a lot of people so I hate to be a party pooper, but I don't think the quality is there.	0
I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland, nothing had seasoning, not even basic salt. Soggy fries, tasteless meat, average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for Italian bread. Save your time, money and calories and go to Wendy's instead.	0
First time ever in Pittsburg and had to have Primanti Bros. Sandwich was awesome! (Cheesesteak) and a tall Yuengling to go with. Perfection!	1
Returned to Pittsburgh, Ate at Primanti a 2nd time:\n\nI stand by my decision: Pass.	0
Primantis is the ideal Pittsburgh sandwich. Fries, coleslaw, provolone, whatever meat you'd like in between the famous mancinis bread. I love this location especially because of the hours. Living downtown it's hard to find places to eat late at night but the market Sqaure primantis is open till 12 o'clock 7 days a week. I've tried variations of the sandwich but my favorite so far is the pastrami. I went tonight and I'll be back again the near future.	1
Not sure that I could eat here more than once every 10 years, but I'll take my chances. I suppose it helps that my doctor's office is 2,500 miles away and the chances are slim that I'll run into him here.	1
Bread, slaw, tomato, fries, and a small piece of overcooked fish all piled together. Warm yiengling and mediocre service.   Aweful	0
Super friendly staff. Got there in the morning before the lunch rush. He sandwich is huge and delicious.	1
Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water, there's a lot of good things going on in the ingredients...In theory, this should've resulted in a bold flavor taste explosion, but I found myself severely let down by all of the bland ingredients piled high in front of me.  The pastrami was terrible, the coleslaw weak, and the fries were bland, dry, and flavorless.  Still bummed, my guess is that this place I more of a tourist draw now than a legit sandwich shop.	0
Worst service ever.  The waitress and I use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  Then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  When she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place.	0
"My partner wanted to try a Pittsburgh cheesesteak sandwich and we read this was the best place to go. I don't like fries and I don't eat cheese, but I still loved my sandwich! I ordered the chicken sans cheese and fries, of course. The cole slaw was very good; I loved that it didn't have mayo in it and the flavor was great. Our waitress recommended that we try their hot sauce on the sandwiches and so glad we did because it really spiced it up and made the sandwich even better. My partner ordered the real deal and said it was delicious as well! We also ordered a \""small\"" beer, which is a full 12 oz glass, pretty sweet deal. \n\nHighly recommend this place"	1
"Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively \""famous\"" for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless, a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy, dirty and probably not even up to code."	0
In Pittsburgh visiting Carnegie Mellon U and was told we had to come here. I ordered the local famous burger. Can't remember the name but it was really good. The bartender was cool and the atmosphere was dope too. Cool place. I'd spend my money there again.	1
I ordered a fave of diners, the Pittsburger. cheesesteak.  It's a burger with cheese coleslaw, French fries  all piled between 2 thick pieces of bread. Looked ok.  It, however, didn't work for me. \nThe coleslaw was great though!!\nIt's not much of a cheesesteak. It's a weird burger. That burger seemed like a fried frozen burger. Not much cheese either. \nMy crew had the kielbasa sandwich and the ham sandwich respectively. They looked great. \nI don't think fries on my sandwich works for me either. I can't hold it against them though. \nI chose poorly. I think they are probably good though. \nMy motto: eat food you recognize.	0
"Alright so being from Texas I'm used to lots of seasoning, lots of flavor, and lots of heat if things are supposed to be spicy.  This sandwich shop lacks all of those things.  This was my first shot at local food (I think it's local, that's what I was told), and definitely nothing to write home about.  They did have some decent draft beer options but no one in my group of 10 said they would come back.  Try another \""local\"" joint if you have an option."	0
Service sucked big time on Monday, June 9, at the Primanti's in Market Square. It took more than a half hour for my wife to get a cheese steak and the place wasn't even crowded. Missed the first inning of the Pirates game as a result. Boo!	0
Highly disappointing. While sandwich is unique it was totally over cooked and under seasoned. No flavor	0
So an honest review.  Bland.  Service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made.  I ordered the new black bean burger sandwich.  Bread not toasted, burger tasted a lot like my morning star black bean burger that I get frozen.  Cole sale was a lot better with the hot sauce I smothered on it.  The best part was by far the fries which weren't all that great.  I am glad that those were home made.  I picked all the bread off ate mostly the fries and was not very impressed.  The beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating.  I'm not a big foodie but I like my food taste better.  I still ate because I was hungry and it's not uneatable, just bland and kinda of boring.  It's still a must do in Pitts so go ahead and do it at least once, but skip the rest of your stay.	0
I always try to hit this location when I'm in town. Great staff menu is solid & a Pittsburgh tradition.	1
Great food overall at all locations! Go to another location to eat though. The Market Square location has the most horrible service I've ever experienced. Horrible!	0
i guess if you are in Pittsburgh and you want to do Pittsburgh things you have to grab a Primanti Bros sandwich but it isn't that good of a sandwich. Pittsburgh is loaded with great places to eat.  you can certainly do better.  having said that, i  totally get grabbing a Primanti Bros if you are in Pitt.	0
This is my go-to place after a Pirate game to wait out the traffic. When it isn't busy the service is great and you can get a quick, cheap bite to eat. Always great to sit outside as well.	1
"I was recommended here by a friend as a place to cross off the Pittsburgh \""bucket list\"". I ended up getting the Pittsburger - it met my expectations, which was above average to begin with. I'd definitely come back here again."	1
Service was bad. Server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return 5 minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong. We didn't see her for a good 20 minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills. She did take one of our cups to refill it, sat it on the bar and left it there for 10 minutes, when we finally saw her again had to ask her to grab it off the bar. Highly disappointing Philly cheesesteak!! The meat in it is that of a frozen Salisbury steak TV dinner!! French fries were good.	0
Good prices and a Pittsburgh Classic. Kolbassi sandwich with Fries? Yum. Spicy rub pickles? Yum. Good beer, too. Nice outside seating but beware the pigeons, sit-down and counter service,	1
First Yelp review ever. Not impressed at all! 45% bread, 25% cole slaw, 25% fries, and 5% meat. The bread is cold and not grilled or warmed on the grill. Avoid and eat else where. Don't even think about the wings (dry and no flavor).	0
"There are some places that are better when you grow up or at least have memories while eating at a restaurant. This was highly recommended to us while visiting Pittsburgh. First, we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a Sunday. We wanted bar type food with a couple of drinks. We were told to go there by several people. I got the capacola, great concept putting the coleslaw and fries in the sandwich but it just tasted bland to me. I asked for them to toast the bread but they said they couldn't do it because it sticks to the grill... \""Can't put a piece of bread on the grill?\"" Again, when there a memories of this place I am sure the sandwich taste better than they really are. But as an outsider judging the food alone, it was sub par."	0
I had the famous Pitts-Burger and it was disgusting! The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the bread. The bread is super soft and tasty but the meat was gross and the cole slaw was bitter. I don't see what the hype is all about!	0
Definitely didn't live up to the expectations.  Being from the east coast I've had my fair share of delicious sandwiches.  Stopped in for lunch and had the capicola sandwich.  Outside of the bread I can't say it was memorable in any way.\n\nThat said I could see this as a post night out stop and would probably enjoy it a lot more.	0
Well, now I know why people don't usually put french fries in their sandwiches. Sandwich comes out huge and kind of dry, and you can't taste the meat at all.	0
Was in town on a baseball stadium tour and heard about this place from the locals.I enjoyed my sandwiches and was hooked with the special slaw added to the sandwiches.I was also in luck once we caught the pirates game I noticed they had primantis in the park so I ordered another sandwich.	1
customer service is always nice but dont you all think that this place is little over-rated? Their 'Almost Famous Sandwitches' need some hard work to get famous. Basically, this place is like Dr. Pepper soda. People are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous.	0
Well I can say I came to Pittsburgh and finally tried the famous sandwich. Oh yes I was in carb coma, but it was so enjoyable. But I have no guilt for eating a whole sandwich by myself. I did wash it down with an ice cold beer. If you are in Pittsburgh like the Food Channel said you have to visit this establishment.  \n\nNow I have to be on a diet :-)	1
The sandwiches are giant, the atmosphere is good. I was there while the Steelers were on, so it was festive.\nI agree they are a little dry...so get hot sauce, or ask for some mayo or ranch, ect...\nAnd it was quite warm in there.	1
Service was excellent! There girls work together so well and is like a welcome committee to the city!! Parking was a bit tricky because of some construction in the square, cool area tho. Food - odd the way they put things together, you would think it would taste nasty but actually it's awesome... slaw, fries and all!!	1
"I've tried it twice now because if you ever mention you're going to Pittsburgh the first thing you hear is \""Oh Man, you HAVE to go to Primanti's\"".  Sorry, I guess it's just not my thing.  It's not horrible once I take off all the french fries they pile up, but it's definitely not my thing."	0
I don't care for Primanti brothers.  It is overrated.  There are much better sandwiches in the city.\n\nThe sandwiches aren't bad, they just aren't great.  I like the fries.  I like the vinegar based cole slaw.  Both are great.  The white bread is fine.  My issue is with the main ingredients.  The main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality.\n\nMy other issue is their restaurants are all filthy.  I've been to 4 different Primanti locations and each one just seems greasy.\n\nBetter Pittsburgh Sandwich Alternatives:\nFathead's has a sandwich with kielbasa and pierogies.\nWingharts has a burger with fries and cole slaw.	0
"Monte Cellos is located fairly close to my work, and so I've gone a few times.  Each time, I ask myself, \""Why am I going back?\""\n\nMediocre dish after Mediocre dish, somehow I think it will get better next time.\n\nLast time I had a Grilled Chicken Salad that they're known for --- at least that's what the cashier said.  It was grilled chicken, french fries, a little cheese on chopped lettuce. Can you say B-O-R-I-N-G?\n\nToday I had a steak hoagie.  Enough places in Pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  While the bread is fresh, and the hoagie buns are huge --- it's all downhill from here.  Enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. The bread is 90% of the meal. Unmemorable.\n\nI was happy with the pizza I had there, but for salads and hoagies? Not so much."	0
"I'm picky about the quality of meat, so I was disappointed when I specifically asked if the chicken parmesan sub had whole breast meat, the cashier said yes, then it turned out to be school cafeteria style chicken patty with bread crumb filler. Yuck, I should've trusted my gut and ordered the eggplant parm. K got the Italian sub. It was \""ok, not the greatest.\"" I recommend trying a different \""cheap eats\"" if you're downtown."	0
There are always atleast 2 group of annoying kids who just loiter and stare at everyone as they're walking in & out. The staff doesn't seem to care. Make sure to check your fries before you leave bc they are sometimes Luke warm. Even after you buy something it's a challenge for them to unlock the bathroom. You stand at the door 5min, walk to the counter and ask again then walk back and wait at the door forever again until finally you head back to the counter one last time and freak out.. all to pop a squat over the toilet. This has happened on two totally different occasions. \n\nThe workers themselves are ok and the managers are nice.	0
I don't know why but this McDonalds always managed to get my order wrong.  This is almost constant.   However there is a young assistant management who is extremely professional and friendly.  He make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly. I believe his name is Matt or something that begins with a M.  (Young guy, brown hair, and awesome tattoos).   \n \nThe major complaint that I have with this location is when the high schools let out.  The tons of students just hang out, cussing or making a lot of noise.  They sit on tables and often just sit at your table.  When Arby's and Wendy's use to be open next door, the management did not put up with this loitering.	0

Their tacos are alright but their groceries are kind of expensive. I've never seen a can of Goya brand beans priced at $1.50. I mean it seems like a little thing, but they couldn't have been more than $.89 a can in San Francisco, where everything else is totally unaffordable.	0
The only place where I can get my taco fix while I'm in Pittsburgh?  Legit.  I always get two lengua tacos.  Lengua is Spanish for delicious, so that's why I always get two lenguas because that's double the awesome (lengua is actually Spanish for tongue, but I find lengua makes for some of the best tacos; super savory and always tender).\n\nTake a fresh tortilla, warm it up on the grill, and top it with a pile on the lengua.  Yes, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of a lime wedge would be preferred, but I guess the Pittsburgh market prefers the lettuce tomato with sour cream deal.  The customer is always right.\n\nAt 2/$5, it's a bit pricier than what I'd expect a taco to cost elsewhere, but in Pittsburgh competing with other food vendors in the Strip, it's priced just right.\n\nThey also do chicken, pork and beef tacos as well as burritos ($5 as well), but if you're in the mood for awesome, do yourself a favor and get some LENGUAAAA.	1
I think this should be more like 1.5 stars. I got a 6-pack of tamales. They were more expensive than I would've guessed (I sort of had to, considering they weren't priced). First I open the package and low-and-behold this bag of six tamales, in fact, contains only five! The filling is fine, but the masa blows. It is dry and gritty. The preparation instructions seem questionable (microwave in a plastic bag? Really?). I'm saving the remaining ones for when I'm too drunk to care about anything. The tortillas are still worth it.	0
"I ate a taco here in the snow. IN THE SNOW! I've eaten a taco here sweating my bum off. I\""ve eaten a taco standing up because there's no tables. This taco stand is so amazing that I'll pretty much eat a taco here during a hurricane....if those happened in western PA! \n\nDoes this not show my true devotion to these tasty little taco's! Ok, I lied. I like them so much I just do it up big and get a burrito. It's just a magic mixture of rice, cheese, salsa and lots and lots of lime. I'm into the shrimp burrito because i love me some shrimp. But really, any type of meat or a veggie choice is going to be awesome. Plus they are cheap cheap cheap! \n\nDo me a favor and stop by this stand while you're out shopping in the strip, you will not regret it. Rain, snow or sunshine!"	1
Best tacos in Pittsburgh. I mean I'll gladly love to be one-upped but til that day comes, best tacos in Pittsburgh! Tacos lenguas is always my choice. They have a very plush selection of Mexican groceries too. Oh and I'm a sucker for flash, so of course I love that spinning barrel they have up front with the blow torch roasting peppers. It makes the whole block smell wonderful!	1
Good: Mexican groceries in Pittsburgh\nBetter: The chipotle tomatillo salsa, homemade by Edgar.\nBest. The taco stand.  Seriously, if you're here, get a damn taco.	1
Being from LA, I was disappointed with the tacos. The Carne Asada was bland and didn't think this is authentic Mexican food but another street faire.	0
I crave these tacos when the sun is shining!	1
The stand outside (edgars), chicken taco with everything on it, best ever.	1
Easily my wife's favorite tacos in Pittsburgh. Pick your meat and then it is filled to the brim with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese. I kind wish they let me fill my own tacos, but it isn't really practical since they generally have a line on the weekends. \n\nThe grocery has the best tortillas, tamales, and salsa in town. I bought the jumbo container of their taco seasoning so I can imitate at home.	1
This review is for the taco stand in front of Reyna's, which is run by the same owner as Reyna's and Casa Reyna. Note that this is *not* the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st Street, across the alley from Pamela's.\n\nI got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago. The meat was cold before I could start eating it, and I assumed it had just cooled off quickly. \n\nWithin a few hours everything I had eaten was leaving me in a hurry. I felt sick and weak for the rest of the day, and was better (and completely empty) the next morning.\n\nNever going back, of course. This doesn't directly reflect on Casa Reyna's inside restaurant, but since the same people run it, it makes me worry about their food handling standards.\n\nI'll probably keep getting Reyna's big bag of chips when I need them for a party, but I'm never eating any other prepared food from them again.	0
Awesome food! Im from LA, so id like to think I know a thing or two about mexican food and I can honestly say this place is a homerun! Great salsa, fresh tortilla chips, friendly owners and staff.	1
This is a top-notch mexican grocery, albeit a small one. They sell corn and flour tortillas made on location that will change your life. They also make a variety of fresh salsas and dips. It also has a good selection of hot sauces and pre-packaged salsas. There is a small selection of produce to and other groceries you need but might not find at regular grocery stores. Overall a must-visit if you're making some Mexican.	1
I have shopped here periodically over the last 8 years I have lived in Pittsburgh but after this last visit NEVER AGAIN! The woman working there was so rude I could hardly believe it. A gentleman came in speaking Spanish and she gave him attitude and even after he started speaking English she was still rude to him.  I accidentally dropped a small bottle of hot syrup ( my bad) I apologized profusely and felt so bad I bought a bunch of other stuff- even after the woman was really nasty about the whole situation. After I walked out I realized she charged me for the broken bottle without even telling me! I guess I should have just walked out without buying stuff. Its a shame because they are close to where I live but next time I'll take the trip to one of the Mexican groceries in Brookline.	0
My favorite bar in the Strip District.  Timeless classic that never goes out of style.  They had a remodeled a few years ago, which opened the front of the restaraunt and they they've created a patio of sorts that is perfect for outside dining when the sun decides to shine.  Excellent seafood options, and you'll never go wrong with the lobster rolls.  The hot lobster roll is served on buttery Mancini roll and melts in your mouth.	1
Went to Rolands for lunch of a Sunday.  Around 30 beers on draft, but mostly the usual beers; only a few micros.\n\nThe actual menus themselves need updating; they're something you'd see in a crappy diner....photocopies stuffed into clear plastic film.  \n\nWe both got salads; one tuna & one salmon.  Huge pieces of fish that were of decent quality.  The upstairs has a cool balcony to hang out on in the summer.  It's a cool place in strip; I'd recommend stopping by and checking it out.	1
OMG what a nightmare. I was there last saturday at 9pm with a group of 10 people in the second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there. ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you. the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses. The restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper . We left the bar and spent a HUGE anoun of money up the street.. I will never go back.	0
Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it.  And the place NEVER lets me down; it's just as bad as I remember.  The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing.	0
My scallops were luke-warm yet overcooked.  The carrots on my salad looked like they had been sitting in the bottom of a fridge for weeks. \n\nThe first time I dined here, I was unimpressed with their lobster roll (which is simply a hollowed-out white roll filled with lobster.  bread and seafood, that's IT).  Today, I was unimpressed with everything.\n\nExcept the woman two tables over who laughed like cigar-smoking circus clown and looked like Patrick Swayze in drag.  That was pretty awesome.	0
"Went to this place for lunch last Saturday, party of five. The service was extremely slow and every beer we tried to order, got the response \""We are out of that one\"". \n\nFinally when we got our sandwiches (after a long wait) but no coleslaw and fries were soggy and stale. When asked the waitress for coleslaw (which is supposed to be the side with every sandwich), the response was \""I think we are out, but let me check\"". And the waitress didn't return until after we were done eating. \nForget about getting a refill for your drink or water.."	0
I was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. The air conditioning was non existent, which is a hangover nightmare. While waiting for a table the bartender ignored us for ten minutes and couldn't even transfer our drinks to the table. He also casually instructed me that one must pay per beer - duh! I'm not a beer drinking novice. The acne-ridden server was friendly enough, but seemed forlorn and was overtly sweating. Bringing drinks to a table isn't neuroscience and I don't drink tap water. After sitting at our table for a few minutes it was very apparent that the entire serving staff is haggard. Appetizer - crab artichoke dip. Bland. Where's the crab? Also, did a toddler arrange the plate? Apparently. Meal - fish tacos. Came quickly and surprisingly flavorful. However, our server never once checked on our status and we had to beckon him to fulfill our needs. I shouldn't have to ask for napkins at the point of need. No tip, never coming back.	0
It was raining and we were in the Strip district craving some seafood.  We decided to stop by Roland's Seafood Grill.\n\nWe were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the US open was playing.  Our orders were taken right away then we waited for 30 minutes before our meals came out.  We were glad for the US Open entertainment.\n\nMy dad order the clam chowder soup, which was chunky and bare of any clams.  My mom and I shared a couple of appetizers, the calamari was great but the crab cake was just ok and a bit salty.\n\nService gets 2 stars and Food gets 3 stars.\n\nOverall, this place gets a 2.5 stars.  If you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area, stop by.  I would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area.	0
Extremely Slow Service!   We have eaten here many times and, while the fish sandwich is great, the staff and management have yet to figure out how to manage the tables. This establishment can become quite busy and, if you don't aggressively pursue service, you are likely to wait 20 minute or more just to get a menu.  This is particularly true if you are sitting in one of the outside areas.	0
We headed to the strip district to soak in the atmosphere like any good tourist should do.\n\nUnfortunately we love to sleep and showed up a little late and by the time we were ready to eat (around 4pm) our list of recommended places to try were already closed for the day. \n\nRoland's was open though. As an added bonus they were showing the Steeler's game and there is nothing that Pittsburgh loves more than supporting the Steeler's and Penguin's. The atmosphere was great with everyone dressed in black and yellow and really into the game.\n\nWe ordered wedding soup (pretty delicious) and Portobello Mushroom Pizza. Maybe our mistake was not ordering seafood, anyway the caramelized onions on it were actually cooked in sugar (eww) and the sauce itself was just as sweet. It felt like we were eating candy.\n\nAs for the staff, Pittsburgh in general has some of the friendliest people I've come across in a long time. The staff here may not have been quite as friendly as we had come to expect from the rest of this lovely city but they were just fine.	0
As others have said, nice location and sitting on the patio is nice in the warm sunny months, but the food is not anything special.  Fried seafood, decent lobster roll, other non-impressive dishes.  good for a few drinks and a quick bite if in the area.	0
I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful.\n\nI complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District.\n\nPlease, please, please go somewhere else.	0
Well I have had several meals over the years at Rolands, many of which were good.  Yesterday was not one of those days.\n\nAfter being seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take a drink order.  I was of course rewarded with the wrong beer.\n\nThen we order and when the food arrived, the fries were cold and the fish sandwich was rather greasy.\n\nI wake up today only to be 'sick' from the whole ordeal.  My mother, who had the same food as I did, is feeling the same as me.\n\nGet your act together Rolands, you are better than this.	0
"Just awful. \n\nMy companions each ordered an Alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that Roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.\n\nWe thought \""maybe it's a 'burgh thing.\""\n\nNope, we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed Alfredo sauce and that the chef \""just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his Alfredo.\"" This stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it (no exaggeration) and there was a bucket full of it on each plate.\n\nAnybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen. \n\nBy the way, my lobster roll was a buttery, greasy fail as well.\n\nWhat a complete disaster."	0
this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.\n\nIf you find yourself at Rolands, do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the Strip District.  Seriously.	0
If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again, or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me I'd pick dining at Rolands but only by the slimmest of margins.\n\nWhy on earth did I go back to this restaurant?  Clearly, I must not love myself or something.\n\nWant to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer?  Dine at Roland's.  The only reason to be at Rolands is to drink there.  they have a pretty decent beer selection.	0
we went three for st, patrick day. Two harps bottle beers and 12 oyster costs $40.	0
Poor service. Monday evening. restaurant not busy. Took 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Ordered a draft and a glass of wine and proceeded to order a lobster roll and steamed mussels. Took another 10 minutes to get the drinks. The lobster roll then showed up and we had finished and the plate was then cleared for the table. We had then been in the restaurant for an hour and we asked for the bill. The waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready. We canceled the order and the bill came with a quick huff and sign the top copy please request as she quickly turned away. Not worth wasting your time.	0
Went on a Wednesday night, not crowded at all. Had to get up and go find someone to wait on our table....overheard who was supposed to be our server telling the hostess she didn't wait on us because she didn't want another table. The food was good, lobster roll and fish sandwiches were great. Service was just awful.	0
"Lobster roll was awesome.  There was a Moosehead beer cap in our fries and the waitress' response was, \""That must be from the beer batter.  I will give them hell.\""   I wasn't looking for a free meal but an apology from someone would have been appropriate."	0
Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated , still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered, but was charged for it.  Was not busy but waitress was hard  to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone.	0
I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary.	0
Lunch on a Wednesday with 4 people. Lobster rolls= excellent!  Crab cake sandwich= excellent!  Yummy, warm fries! Very good service and warm food!  Was worried when we saw poor rating on Yelp. Very happy and will come back!	1
I've tried and tried to give this place a chance.  It's upsets me that an establishment like this can exist among so many great places in the Strip.  I end up at Roland's because my boyfriend's co-workers always want to go there for happy hour.  They have a special on oysters and shrimp cocktail, so I ordered those.  The oysters were absolutely disgusting.  They were not fresh, or cleaned very well.  My fingers ended up getting all dirty and they had a gross, gritty taste to them.  They threw the POORLY deveined shrimp on ice, and it ended up soggy.  I had to pick the veins out myself, and after about two I lost my appetite.  As always, the service was terrible.  Next time I'm dragged to a happy hour there, I'll order water.  Never again will I spend money in this place.  YUCK!	0
Service was great, however, the food was mediocre.  Hostess needs to be more educated about the menu, she was unable to give details on menu items.\nLets start the with fries that seem to be mandatory with each entree.  They had to be cooked prior to us ordering, or even getting there.  They were cold, limp (pause) and over salted.  The burger was just eh.  Grilled onions seemed to be just warmed on the grill, and the beef patty could have used a bit more flavor.  Fat has the flavor people!\n\nOh, the floor at our first table was filthy.  Then the table at the second table was filthy.  What's up with that?\n\nOverall, this joint was not that great.	0
We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really??!! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money.	0
"Overall, my experience was okay. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very friendly and helpful. We got the scallop appetizer and it was TO DIE FOR! I will 100% go back for that! That being said, it was downhill from there. We got the lobster roll and lobster ravioli...and both were \""ehhh.\"" The lobster roll had a ton of lobster on it (yeah!) but there wasn't any other seasoning or any type of dressing to tie it all together. The lobster  ravioli was the biggest disappointment because it had absolutely NO flavor....I had to grab the salt shaker and even then it barely had a taste. I can't even comment on the lobster inside of the ravioli because the whole thing just tasted like nothing.\n\nI'll go back for the scallops, but wouldn't recommend anything else."	0
Overall, the experience here was pretty good.  I had the lobster roll previously and wanted to go back for it a second time on a Friday during lent.  I expected it to be quite crowded during dinner time, however arriving at 6:30 there was no wait for 3.  The lobster roll was pretty good, although I do remember it being better. I wished that there was something extra on the sandwich, such as melted butter. And they raised the price a dollar.  Roland's has a huge draft beer selection. Each of us tried a different beer and they were reasonably priced, around $4.50 each.  I would definitely go back, but not any time soon.	1
This was my second time eating at Roland's  seafood Grill the first time I had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table. It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again!!! It wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight again.	0
"I really wanted to like this place. The beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley. Unfortunately the food was not. The \""famous\"" lobster roll had so much butter on it I think I am going to have a heart attack in my sleep tonight. Can't recommend the place."	0
Meh. \n\nClam chowder was big and OK.  Veggie sandwich had great,  greasy, grilled Mancini bread but came with soggy fries and was mediocre overall. \n\nOur waitress told us she was new at least 20 times so she wasn't much help in recommending any dishes. \n\nI probably won't go back again.  For $25 a person,  I can do better elsewhere \n.	0
Rough experience today - had one drink and left. Waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy. When I said something - everyone wanted to blame someone else - waitress couldn't describe beer and didnt iffer to find out or sample it - brought 12 year old son a pop in a little kids cup. Waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave.	0
Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken, when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then, our oyster order came out on a plate of water, not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next, the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check, took a long time again. Normally, I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry. This place is terrible. Spend your money somewhere else.	0
Like a glutton for punishment, I hit up Roland's again last night while in town for business. I tired Kaya, but the wait was 30 + minutes.\n\nHere's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room, which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside. \n\nI had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before, it was just OK.  Service was better this time though. \n\nAll in all, I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal. \n\nSave your money and try somewhere else. \n\nPS. Beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world.	0
Poor excuse for seafood!   The place is overrated.  Good place to have drinks on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon-but that's about it.  The employees are anything but friendly. Unless you sit at the bar, the service is poor. Isn't even that great at the bar.  If you want good seafood, go a couple blocks up the street to Luke Wholeys.  So much better quality!  This place is definitely not for those with sophisticated palates!	0
The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4, & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. Ordered an app & left 25 minutes later, the lobster nachos never came, which sucked because I was quote excited about those. The place is gross! There was food & trash all over the floor & I watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. This was confirmed by my wife. Skip this place & go anywhere else in the Strip District	0
I'm surprised Roland's has such bad reviews. I've never had anything bad here. Their lobster rolls are very good and you get a large portion of lobster in it. The clam chowder is good, their seafood pizza is awesome. I honestly have never had a complaint about their food. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is the service is usually pretty slow. Even when we go when not a lot of customers are there, the service still seems to be slow. I would definitely go back.	1
Super disappointed in this place. Came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat. All I ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, and ten minutes prior to painting I still had not received mine. On top of that, there was only one bartender working the whole top floor. When we told him I'd have to cancel my order to begin the event he began cursing about the staff at the restaurant- it was incredibly awkward. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. Will not be coming back to this place unless I'm dragged.	0
Went there Saturday November29, 2014. Entered establishment at 5:30 pm. PROS.....Very good clam chowder...biggest bowl of it I've ever been served. Sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....Both very good, although the fish was slightly overcooked. Again...huge portions.   CONS...After being at table since 5:30, nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. After being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked, 15 minutes later it was served. As good as it was, it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. Our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. They may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a Saturday night. The best though was the incompetent hostess. The hostess with the leastest. Talk about someone who didn't have a clue. From screwing up where we were supposed to sit, to watching her continue to do the same thing with others, at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. What a twit.	0
"Usually I really like this place.  Stopped in after not eating all day, and ordered the \""famous\"" lobster roll.  It took 40  minutes to receive a medium piece of lobster claw on thick Mancino toast.  THATS IT!  Oh and less than stellar fries, with a cup of cole slaw.  I waited with an empty pint glass several times as well...I guess you can't get it right every time."	0
We were shopping on a cold day in the Strip District and decided to try this place for lunch because of the sign advertising the hot lobster roll. It was pretty empty; a few early drinkers at the bar and a few couples seated at tables. I ordered a bloody mary which honestly tasted weird, so I'm not sure what was going on there. For food, we ordered clam chowder, a hot lobster roll, and a fish sandwich. The clam chowder was really tasty with good consistency and was a huge serving, much larger than we expected. The hot lobster roll was rich, buttery, and warm, and the lobster was good and fresh. The fish sandwich was gigantic... two huge fillets breaded and fried with tons of french fries. It was a little greasy but pretty tasty. Overall, I was happy with lunch and with the service and I would probably go again for the lobster roll or the clam chowder.	1
My family owns a coffee plantation in PR, and visiting this place reminds me of all the scents brought about by the roasting process and all the aromas different coffee beans can exude.  Without a doubt it is a great stop for both Coffee and Tea lovers.\n\nI don't get down to Market Square as often as I'd like, but when I do, there's always a stop at Nicholas Coffee Co.  Great quality, and awesome products.	1
"For a moment I will need you to ignore my name. Okay good, now that you have ignored it, let's talk about how freaking awesome this place \""Nicholas Coffee\"" is in Market Square. \n\nYeah I know what you are thinking, \""well you are just saying that because it's like your name\"" Wrong. You ignored my name as mentioned above so you know now there is no bias. \n\nMoving on. If you ever wanted really dive into coffee, please go here. For Pittsburgh it's basically the epicenter of caffeine. You walk in and can feel the roasted beans scurry up your nostrils to only have you feel delighted as you now bath in its smooth roasted goodness.\n\nThe downside here is there is really nowhere to sit and it's really just meant as a place to stop in and leave as oppose to hang around. \n\nThe upside is there is SO MUCH coffee to choose from. It will blow your freaking mind/ melt your brain. Whichever comes first.\n\nIf you really love coffee, come here. Mediocre coffee drinkers beware."	1
One of the best places to buy coffee in the city. The Raspberry Truffle Latte is my personal favorite, but be sure to try their other speciality drinks that they post. Great location (Market Square), great environment and atmosphere, and friendly and helpful staff. Get a cuppa!	1
"When I worked downtown years ago, Nicholas Coffee was the \""nuts\"" so to speak.   \n\nNow that I'm back working in town again, I was ecstatic that I can get a fresh cup of fabulous flavored coffee every morning as I walk to work through Market Square.\n\nIf you are a high maintenance coffee person, this is the place for you!  The flavored coffee is the BEST, one can immediately taste the difference from the brews here and the nauseating Hazelnut that is sold at every other place that sells coffee.  That flavor should be banished from the Earth, but that's another story.\n\nTry the Graham Cracker, Chocolate Orange, Almond Joy or Coconut, delicious!  Nicholas also carries freshly baked biscotti in a variety of flavors as well as other eclectic baked goods. \n\nA must stop for visiting guests and coffee/tea lovers!"	1
Just bought a latte and child's hot chocolate, and both were good and the smell of the place is awesome... I coffee beans!	1
Great coffee and Tea selection.  Good prices for latte's, cappuccino, ect...	1
I knew it was going to be a fail as I watched the 'Barista' slopping together a latte for the customer in front of me.  I ordered a coffee of the day instead--meh, I've had better.  My wife got a soy latte:  he dumped the milk in, without technique, and over-heated the milk.  It was a watery, soppy mess.  \n\nWe want Nicholas to be great--or now, better.  Train the staff!	0
This place is located in the Market District of downtown Pittsburgh. First of all, when you walk in the smell of gourmet coffee is delicious! They sell gourmet coffees and teas as well as extras like honey that is specifically for tea, rare candies and I believe cigars.\n\nThis also serves as a small coffee house and roasting facility. Just to give you an idea of what the patrons think, it's located right across the plaza from the local Starbucks and the line was longer here than Starbucks! Surprising.\n\nThe inside of the shop is clean and well organized. You definitely don't mind waiting in line in a room that smells this good! The staff seemed relatively well informed and courteous. I can't speak to how well trained they are because I didn't have them prepare me a drink. I had gone to Starbucks.	1
Wide variety on coffee & teas - even cigars. Relaxed atmosphere & friendly people.  Lots of flavored coffees, though I'm not a huge fan flavored coffees.	1
This hidden gem, tucked away in the corner of Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, offers more than just coffee.  Sure, it's easy to be lazy and unadventurous and go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, but why not take a chance and support a Pittsburgh staple since the 1800s?  They must be doing something right to stay around that long.  They also roast their beans in-house...in Market Square.  Amazing.\n\nNicholas Coffee Co. has a unique ambiance.  I'd say it's vintage bookstore chic, but your opinion and description may differ.  With a HUGE selection of coffee, fresh baked goods from local vendors,  friendly staff, and a humidor for the casual cigar aficionado, there's a little something for everyone.  \n\nThe coffee by the cup is very reasonably priced, and you can buy coffee in bulk, or buy a few sample packs to find your favorite brew before buying by the pound.	1
I'd heard good reviews, so I stopped in last time I was downtown, but I'm not impressed by their coffee. Dark roasted, bitter, etc. If I'm looking for coffee downtown, I'd go find that 21st St. Coffee branch instead. Still, they sell a bunch of other neat snacks and stuff, and it beats a chain.	0
The owner, Nicholas G Nicholas needs to attend a few driving classes before he kills someone. Maybe too much hp for him. If you see an 08 white porsche with FL plate 917 MNC stay clear. Guy drives like a nut. Almost ran me off the road in Boca Raton by 95.	0
This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, Mike & Tony's closes by 6pm. You won't get good service, you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However, the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit, and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30. \n\nOverall, there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown, so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich. Otherwise, hold out for one of downtown's great lunch spots.	0
I go here almost weekly. You can get a huge grilled chicken salad with bread and tzatiki for $6.25. Absolutely worth it for the money.	1
The food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch.  The service is quick and the prices are reasonable for Downtown.  They are open late hours, so sometimes that can be handy.  There are better places for Greek food, but Salonika's is often close by.	0
I like their gyro salad. It tastes very good with the pita bread. Good portion. I don't get hungry later afternoon.	1
"I was running out of time today at lunch and needed somewhere to grab lunch. On a positive note, i seen the Google street view car downtown :)\n\nAnyways, my gyro just wasnt that good. It seemed smaller than any other gyro in town, the fries were just frozen potatoes with no flavor and it just wasn't a very awesome experience.\n\nAlso, almost $9 for a small gyro, frozen fries & a small drink is not a \""deal\"". M&Ts is $7.50- same fries of course  but a large, delicious gyro.  I dunno, I've heard great things about this place but i'll stick with my regular oll Zorba's for downtown or M&Ts afterhours."	0
Just got a small, pre-made chicken salad sandwich and a cup of chicken chili from the Fifth Avenue store, and paid over $9. You can get much better quality and value elsewhere in Pittsburgh.	0
Looks shady, tastes great. Lunch for under $5 a person and you walk out stuffed. What a deal!\n\nService is fast and friendly. Prices are fair for pizza anywhere, let alone downtown.\n\nWhen we walked in the door, we were the only customers. Combined with the dated decor, we weren't sure that we had made the right decision. We sat down, ordered a pizza and it was served within 15 minutes. By the time we left, the place was packed with only a few open seats left so it would appear that the secret is out.	1
Delicious home made authentic italian classics.  Low prices.  Extremely generous portions.  For the same price as a Jimmy John's sandwich or Moe's Burrito, you can have a expertly prepared Italian feast with all fresh ingredients.\n\nWhy not a 5?  The service can be slow during the lunch rush, and the interior is a bit run down.  If you aren't in a crazy rush, your money won't go farther for better food anywhere in Market Square.	1
This place looked hopeful for authentic Mediterranean but the food just didn't live up to any expecation. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Cafe Milano.	0
Light Up Night.  Food has good flavor but doesn't look so hot.  If I hear about the Jackie O desert one more time I'm gonna barf.	0
"3.5 Stars\n\nChristos is a sort of charmingly run-down sort of place, particularly given that many of the other offerings in the Cultural District are pretty new joints.  The food is better than average.  Having just eaten at DC's supposedly cheapest and best Greek restaurant the week I was in Pittsburgh, I found the food to be more authentic, better seasoned, fresher and definitely cheaper.\n\nWe had a group of 10 on a Sunday night.  The restaurant owner/manager/old Greek guy came out onto the sidewalk as we were walking by and practically begged us to come in.\n\nI had a grilled fish dish that was nicely cooked along with a glass of the house red wine.  At the end of our meals we decided we had to try the famous \""Jackie O cake,\"" which was, sad to say, nothing particularly special.\n\nBest of all, we had no problems splitting the check multiple ways when it came time to leave."	1
Dirty, unclean, my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.  \n\nTo get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs.\n\n When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood. \n\n Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty, but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen.	0
This can be summed up as follows: For Greek food, go to Salonika directly across the street. \nThis place is below par in just about every way. The prices are not high, but the servers seem more like salesmen in pressuring you to add dessert, etc. (At lunch?). I haven't been impressed by the food after numerous tries, and the atmosphere is dated and dingy. \nI would much rather go across the street at a place with no pretensions (counter service) and pay for honest food that I can see being prepared.	0
"The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff, although nice, was very salesy always trying to \""add on\"" something in a pushy way. \n\nI asked for my check and barely ate anything. I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his \""Best In City\"" award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table... a shame the award was from 2005! I guess a lot changed in 7 years?\n\nDon't bother with this place!"	0
The food here is authentic and tasty and the place itself is a gem of kitch. Do not go here if you want a fine dining experience. The servers are odd, but that's part of the experience. The dining room may be cluttered with old photos, objects representing Greek culture and other oddities, but again that's part of the charm. The food is really, really good and I believe it is very well priced for what you get. \n\nThey also have this amazing soup that seems to have magical powers when it comes to curing a cold. Fabulous!	1
"This is the first time in a long while (10 yrs?) and now I remember why. The food is fair at best for the main meal. The salad is good but small. The hummus is a little bland. The best parts were the \""homemade\"" wine, both white and red, kinda like adult kool-aid  and the Jackie O cake was great. My issue was the price, $59. for dinner for 2. For this price, I would have expected more.I can't believe the 4 and 5 star reviews that I have read on this site. It's hard to believe that this place rates so many opposing reviews. I will never go back here again."	0
Excellent everything! Classic family-run Greek restaurant. Home made everything, including great family-made Greek wine. Inexpensive and authentic. Christos, the owner is hospitable and welcoming. I come from NYC, and I say this is right on par with the Greek food back home.	1
Christos was one of the worst experiences I've ever had while dining in Pittsburgh. They call this a Greek restaurant but they don't even have a normal gyro on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided to split the platter, which was horrible. The gyro meat wasn't off the spick, the dolmades were the worst thing ever eaten in my life and they charged us 4.00 to split it which we didn't even ask for in the first place. The only pleasant thing about this place was the cook who ended up serving us our food after our waiter went out for what seemed like a drug deal. Over all, everything was bad and I would never return and would advice everyone else to do the same.	0
So....I read the reviews on Yelp & Urban Spoon.\nMostly negative, but hey I was hungry and gave it a shot.\nIt's true the place is dingy & like entering a Greek grandfather's home. \nI was first asked  if I wanted huumus. I declined that after reading is was mediocre at best. So I tried the $5.25 saganaki. It came out in an old brown dish with what looked like rubber floating in lemon juice and oil. * The owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra.\nIt tasted WORSE than it looked (if that was possible). Tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy. * I have had many saganaki in various countries. This ranked as one of the VERY worst! I made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in. Bottom line:  HORRIFIC !!!	0
Magic happens at this restaurant. Beautiful family, beautiful service, wonderful food (and wine).\n\nWe love you Monica!!!!\nLove always, your friends in CA	1
Ordered take out from Christos.  I ordered a diet coke and it was in a cup.  THANK GOODNESS I took the lid off first.  There were HUNDREDS of large white particles in the diet coke that looked like paint chips,  eggshells or paper and did not dissolve in the liquid but remained floating around.  This is a health hazard and needless to say, I will not be ordering from this establishment again.  As for the food, mediocre at best  The baklava was average, the mixed grille kabab (chicken and lamb) was okay, dry and chewy at times but overall edible.  The salad that came with the mixed grille was decent in flavor but did have some brown old lettuce in it.  As for the cold combination, the tzatziki, one grape leaf, and hummus were fine but the tarmasalata had some ingredient which was clearly spoiled.  The cr\u00e8me caramel (greek version of flan) was floating in water, really strange texture; my guess is it was frozen then defrosted, but a dessert should absolutely not be floating in a large pool of water.	0
I come here every time I'm in Pittsburgh and always have a great time so I'm kind of confused as to why others say otherwise. The ambience is really nice-- it has an intimate, yet warm, homey feel to it, which is good if you want to go for a date or with your family. It is decorated with authentic old Greek photos which always make me feel at home (although I'm from Sicily!) The food is great every time I go there and SOO filling --I feel like I'm at home and my grandmother is stuffing me with food! I don't have to even mention the Jackie O as everyone is probably aware by now of how scrumdiddlyumptious it is! Will be in Pittsburgh soon so you'll know where to find me -- Christos!	1
Fettucini from a can, anyone? \n\nIf you like paying $10 for tasteless pasta and sauces, this is your place!\n\nStay away and never look back.	0
great place to just look around, but they serve food too. i saw the other reviews and they didnt like it. hmmmm. i loved their food. 2 can dine for 25 bucks and itss good.	1
Spag Warehouse is the best value for money in the tri-state area.... damn good food!!	1
Service is lacking and food is mediocre. When I crave Italian this is not the first place I think of.	0
"I've been here once, so this is sort of a \""first-impression\"" review.  I've always heard good things about the Spaghetti Warehouse, and I'm one to love a great dish of spaghetti and meatballs!\n\nA friend of mine had a buy-one-get-one coupon from the local newspaper, so the two of us ate for the price of one. Our bill, including tip, was $20. \n\nThe spaghetti I ordered was fabulous, but the lasagna my buddy ordered looked even better!  This lasagna was huge.   I love that you get bread and salad with your pasta dish.\n\nThe decor is pretty cool, and the place is large. Free parking was a plus!  The only complaint I would offer here is that our waitress seemed to be very disinterested in her job. Not sure if she was having a bad day or what, but she just wasn't very friendly.\n\nNonetheless, I'll go back!  Good food, good decor, generally good service!"	1
"Why come to this place when you have a tasty world of Italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this town!\n\nThe place is essentially a tourist-trap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a \""fun\"" looking italian warehouse (now...how would this be fun? Apparently it is to some.)\n\nDon't get me wrong...the food is not atrocious. But it certainly is sub-par. My chicken parm was quite un-tasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can. The service was mediocre.\n\nKeep driving to Bloomfield!"	0
Didn't think this was possible, but it's worse than Olive Garden...food was horrible and extremely overpriced, service was decidedly lacking....  Neat location with fun and interesting decor but I wouldn't eat there again.	0
"Yes-the food is good and the portions are big.  Our waiter was very speedy and attentive.  That being said, I cannot ever go back to this place again because of the amount of bugs I saw in such a short period of time.  All gnats and thankfully nothing worse but who knows what's going on in the kitchen?  Not just a stray gnat or two but dozens just swarmed our table.  I killed one with my bare hand on the table and another one bit me and drew a (spec) of blood. Disgusting. A \""manager\"" (looked like a bus boy if you ask me but what do I know) did come to talk to us about it after my waiter noticed me covering my food with my napkin but it didn't accomplish much, no free meal or anything.  I noticed other people moving to other parts of the restaurant to avoid these bugs too."	0
Why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me.  I had read prior yelp reviews and I knew what I was getting myself into.  To make a long story short, I went here because I was with several other people that wanted to go here and I really had no choice.  Anyway, I ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken. The sauce was really disgusting. I found myself eating only the pieces of chicken breast.  I brought this meal home because my husband isn't as picky as I am, but he took two bites and got mad at me for not warning him how aweful this meal was.  I will not be eating with this group of people again if they choose to go here again.	0
The food is horrible - how can you serve pasta and marinara sauce and not even toss the pasta in the sauce?  I truly received a pile of watery noodles with a ladle of sauce on top.\n\nActually, the name says it all.  While this place has an italian food menu, there isn't an italian bone in its body.  You feel as if you are being served italian food from an irish line cook.\n\nThe restaurant decor was really nice when they last decorated it in 1981, which was also the last time that they updated the menu.	0
We went here recently right before a 2-day, 150-mile bike ride to carbo-load. The food was okay - probably what we should have expected for the low prices - but the service was horrible. It was not busy, but we could not get our waitresses attention despite multiple attempts. We needed a refill and asked for one when she took our dinner order, and reminded her when our dinner arrived. We were finally able to flag her down 10 minutes later to remind her again. It also took about 20 minutes to get the check after we had FINISHED our entrees. I am sure that not all of the servers are that bad, but I'm not sure I will be back to find out.	0
I walked in expecting a great experience. It has a great atmosphere. There was nothing wrong with our service, but the food was overpriced and pretty meh. I had the tiramisu which is one of my favorites to get and it was horrible. It tasted like it came out of a Walmart freezer on clearance. Won't be coming back anytime soon.	0
"Surprisingly peaceful...not overly packed packed wit customers considering it was 1pm on Monday...\n\nLocated minutes from the Strip District...sufficient parking available on the side...had to wait several minutes to be seated cuz no hostess was available...\n\nDecor was eclectic ...brings u back to the days of the \""phone booth\""...i wouldn't know them days...lol :)\n\nThe food was amazing :) the salmon was juicy and tasty...but wasn't a fan of the green paste on top... Fettuccine Alfredo was average...no different from fettuccine Alfredo from other restaurants... What really stood out was the soups...we had wedding and minestrone ...both were very hearty...and full of flavor ...\n\nWaitress was friendly and timely and lunch times prices can't be beat considering their big portions :)"	1
Arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday night, there was a 20 minute wait although although empty tables were visible.  Got seated at 7:30, put order in shortly thereafter.  We got bread and our soups fairly quickly then sat for an hour without any signs of food.  We looked around the restraint and it was obvious other tables had been waiting and we're getting frustrated.  The waitress apologized the kitchen was slow, so we gave it another 15 minutes before we finally walked out at 9:15 still hungry.  The food I saw looked good, but I would never recommend this place.  It doesn't take over an hour and a half to make a friggin salad and pasta.	0
This is a one time visit. The worst service ever. It was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress. The food was mediocre at best. The bruschetta appetizer for 4.99 had 4 tiny pieces of bread with some tomatoes on top. Not even shaved cheese, nothing. Total waste of money. The lasagna that they claim is so great in my opinion was diner quality, and that might insult some great diners.	0
It has been years sense we visited the spaghetti warehouse, my husband and I couldn't remember why we haven't been back. We had purchased a groupon for this place and decided to try it for an early dinner... Our first step in the restaurant and then it hit us on why we haven't returned.. The odd smell hits you at first step in the restaurant , you look around in the foyer and you see weird and dilapidated pictures, a candy stand that probably hasn't been used in years.. We get seated in a booth with one side ripped and the other side stained, our waitress was nice but that is far as she went. The food is mediocre at best, the bread and the endless salad was the saving grace of dinner... We wanted to enjoy this place and tried to have a good time, we would not recommend this place to anyone... There are plenty of other good restaurants in the strip and in lawrenceville..	0
Came here a year or so ago to meet some friends... overall not a good experience.  There were 4 of us and I don't think one plate was cleared or drinks refilled, it was a slow weeknight as well.  So yes that could have just been bad luck with the waitress, but food is sub-par and atmosphere is well.\nI suppose this is a good dining option in some situations, but there are so many other places in the area, and I guess this was just nothing to write home about for me.	0
I had spaghetti warehouse delivered to my apt and I ordered spaghetti and meatballs while my boyfriend ordered chicken Parmesan. First off, we both asked for Caesar salads (which we paid extra for) and we didn't even get them. Besides that, the sauce was less than mediocre - a glorified ketchup with noodles. The chicken was dry and we couldn't eat half of the meals. Overall, very poor experience with spaghetti warehouse. You're better off getting fast food noodles from noodles and company. Seriously disappointed especially since it is called the SPAGHETTI warehouse. Very hard to mess up spaghetti.	0
DO NOT GO HERE! They are understaffed, incompetent,  and slow. It was like getting waited on by 1st job people. The place smells like bleach. It's tacky too hot. They play pop music and it's supposed to be an Italian place. Not one person there ever smiled and I was treated like a body in a chair not a person wanting to enjoy a meal. Very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals. I suggest eating out of a seafood dumpster if you plan on going here.	0
Im soo surprised with the food that we ate. Im from California and was excited to experience this restaurant. Especially, since it is a local fav. I ordered the house made spaghetti expecting a fresh tomato base sauce. Unfortunately what I got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions. It had no...flavor!  Now maybe I ruined the meal by ordering gluten free noodles....but I didnt think that would make it this bad. Im soo sorry because our server was awesome and they even accommodated our big party. On a good note, the bread was delicious.\nAs much as I hate Olive Garden...I would preferred that.	0
A long long time ago in a far away place, I used to go to a place called Spaghetti Warehouse that was cool, clean, had good service, and had really good food. But that place is gone and now I'm left at this place that is dirty, has horrible service, and mediocre food. The end. Never coming back.	0
No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked, mushy noodles, watery tomato gravy, and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously, Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. \n\nAgain, my advice to any Italian food lover, find a good neighborhood, family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate.	0
Took two and a half hours to get our food. All our food was the thrown together in the same pan. Not worth the $55.	0
love their drinks and they have good food. the staff is friendly and take out is prepared correctly and quickly. Costco has gift cards that cost less than the face value so you can really get more bang for your buck!	1
Ordered delivery. The food showed up 2.5 hours later-which is acceptable, as it's (just) within the delivery window specified. However, the food had apparently been prepared within 15 minutes of receiving our order, because it was cold by the time we got it. I didn't listen to the other reviews and paid the price (literally)... if someone else is saved a crappy SW dinner by this review, my meal (or lack thereof) will not have been in vain.	0
Worst place ever.  I took my friend there for the first time and my son.  We waited a hour for food.  The waiter got us out water not our sangria  30 min later out salads and after  another 40 min of my kid begging for his pizza we decided to go.  The reason they messed up the order.  We talked to the manager I'm assuming which didn't really care.  Said hopefully we come back because service isn't usually this bad. Never again. Unprofessional and rude	0
Our terrible experience began with a 45 minute wait only to find half the tables empty and the table behind us being consoled by the manager after their own bad experience. We hopped this was a one off and not typical. Our waiter was prompt but very aloof, but we all have off days. The food was mostly bland and flavorless to the point we could not finish it.  This is where things took a turn for the worse, as our order was being boxed up it fell on the floor. Despite our insistence we did not want another the overcompensating manager brought it anyway. We passed it on to the party behind us, maybe they took it home and added some seasoning, it needs it. Avoid this place at all costs!	0
Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food.	0
We went on a Saturday night. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait...but it was likely closer to 45-50 minutes. \n\nThe food is just average. Nothing special. Didn't seem handmade or anything like that. I thought they were known for their lasagna...so I got that. Blah...average.\n\nService was incredibly slow. I don't think the waiter checked on us once.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back.\n\nVisited October 2014	0
We went here with sixteen people. The only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends. The service was pretty good to considering the large party. My wife and I got the Sicilian Sampler Appetizer and The Ultimate Feast for two, as our dinner entree. The Calamari was uneatable and the Ravioli was just down right nasty. The wedding soup was the worst I have ever had. The meat balls had absolute no taste, kind of like cardboard. The Pork Sausage tasted burnt. The Spaghetti tasted no different than Boxed pasta. The Lasagna might have had 15 layers but 12 of them were noodles and sauce, you had to search for any meat or cheese. Our garlic bread came out literally black. I can't even believe somebody would serve that. We will not be back.	0
The Exhibits were few but there were some powerful ones and some funny ones. All really modern even in how they were presented. A cool shop - definitely a place to buy home decor items or gifts. It was worth stopping in especially since it was free. It adds a good dimension to a trip to the strip. I definitelly recommend it. There is probably at least one thing here in for every type of person.	1
The food is awesome. Nice atmosphere. Come in on happy-hour that you can get oysters for $2 and colossal shrimps for $2.25 at the bar. They are a must-try.	1
I know I'm a steak snob but I found this Mortons perfectly adequate. The service was just okay. We asked our waiter for a recommendation on a side dish and he not only forgot to bring it but also what we ordered!  And you think they were bottling it themselves when we asked for a second bottle of wine. The only saving grace was the chocolate mousse which was a little cup of whipped heaven.	0
I came here for my birthday dinner.  I was not impressed at all.  First off, we sat at the booth near where the host has his podium.  He seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable.  \n\nI did like the nice touch of having my name printed on the menu and service by our waitress was good.  However, food wise, it was just OK and a bit disappointing.  I of course had filet, and I was just so underwhelmed with it.  The flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring.  \n\nAfter this experience, I have no desire to ever come to this restaurant again.	0
Morton's is one of my all time favorite steakhouses. We have been to this location on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed. \n\nTo start, we've had the raw bar appetizer which is always fresh and delicious. I always order the filet mignon medium rare, while my husband will change up what he gets. The sides are huge and made for sharing. The creamed spinach is yummy, the baked potato is huge, the hashed brown potatoes are nice and crispy but I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. \n\nThe key lime pie is delicious and the legendary hot chocolate cake melts in your mouth but the souffl\u00e9 for two is always a winner. \n\nAlso, don't worry about parking because they have valet up front.	1
I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. \nThe environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended.	1
We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati, and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at Morton's in Pittsburgh. Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey.	0
This is definitely an old school hang out with a classic menu.   Although my steak was cooked perfectly,  I can't speak to the quality of the ingredients as they lacked natural flavour of meat and fish that I love.   My biggest gripe, though, would be the overcooked scallops.  If you are an adventure Eater or like common things cooked in uncommon ways, I would skip this one.	0
Refined, classic style steak restaurant, Mortons will not disappoint those who are looking for a traditional upper end place. \n\nYards of linen, tons of silverware, and hordes of waiters make this place a must go in Pittsburgh.\n\nOur table of six enjoyed perfectly done steaks and fillets, beautiful accompaniments of vegetables and potatoes, great salads,  excellent desserts, along with an impressive wine offering.  \n\nExpect to pay heavily for this experience, it is well worth it.	1
Wow, not so much.  I haven't been to a Morton's in years, but was happy to be going back for a business dinner.  I thought the service was exceptional, but the food was mediocre at best.  The filet that I ordered was cooked to perfection, a nice portion, and tender as can be -- but absolutely no taste.  Nothing.  Nothing discernible at all.  I can tell you that with all of the above and no taste, it was all for naught.  Unrelated and not the blame of the server, of course -- again, service was great -- one of my colleagues found a piece of hard plastic in his veal chop.  He thought the veal chop was great, but wasn't real excited about the plastic in his dish, which the server promptly removed from the bill.  I brought another colleague's salmon home with me and heated it up the next day.  Oddly enough, a beautiful piece of salmon -- absolutely NO flavor.  Very strange experience.  I doubt I'll ever return.  Coincidentally, the place was empty on a Thursday evening.	0
How this place got 4 stars when there are so many better options in Pittsburgh is beyond me.  The only thing that was noteworthy about the experience here was the price. The food was bland. Nothing to write home about. The place looks uppity, but really the food is just ok. Go to Ruth's Chris instead.	0
If you're not looking careful enough, you could miss New Sambok Oriental Foods on Penn. It's a very small Korean market, very hole-in-the-wall Strip storefront, on the corner of Penn and 18th St. \n\nThere is a decent selection of your typical Korean products, snacks, drinks, red pepper, ready made sides, and ramen. They sell kimchi which I bought once, to save time, and it didn't go to waste. If you're not used to old style Asian markets, you might have second thoughts about shopping here, it's a little on the dark side lighting wise, and small. \n\nOn the weekends, the owner cooks Korean snacks on the sidewalk in front of the store, my fave is the Korean pancake with kimchi sprouts. The owners are a friendly, older couple. Not the worst store I've ever been too, I've been to better. Can't complain too much since there isn't a large Korean population in Pittsburgh. Just be sure to look for best by dates, since turnover is probably pretty slow.	0
I was first introduced to Korean food my freshman year in college. It was a match made in kimchi heaven. This love affair has now extended to the Korean culture and language. Sam Bok is the perfect venue to get anything Korean cuisine related and has some wonderful Ahjummas (ladies) who will let you try out you newly mastered though limited skills at speaking Korean. \n\nI love making my own kimchi chigae - not proficient enough to make my own kimchi though. Sam Bok sells really good cabbage and radish kimchi that you can pick up anytime. It's available in several sizes. I also like their black bean sauce, yam noodle packets, spices and spicy ramyun packets (Asian ramen that will blow your socks off). I recently picked up a couple of bread rolls with cream filling which is a Korean delicacy that satisfies your sweet and savory cravings. Sam Bok's bread was wonderful, I will definitely go back for more of those. \n\nI suggest giving Sam Bok a shot, it's unique, local and always inviting.	1
As a grocery store, I'm not much of a fan. The grocery items here are way too expensive. The only thing I buy here is seaweed wrap, but other than that I avoid buying grocery here. \n\nThe one thing I love about this place is the hot street food in front of the store every weekend! I have tried everything: chicken on a stick, fried rice, egg rolls, vegetable lo mein and pancakes. Everything is well prepared, well seasoned and well cooked. \n\nOverall, I don't recommend the grocery store, but highly recommend the hot food if you're in the strip area and craving a quick, cheap snack.	1
I'm used to going to a private practice in Columbus, Ohio for my glasses needs. But I've moved to Pittsburgh and needed some place economical . I booked my appt online the night before but showed up late.... I didn't know there was a marathon going on . I just wanted to get an exam so I could buy glasses online . The staff was nice and rescheduled me for the next slot. Everyone was nice including the doctor .  Although I didn't initially want glasses 2 pair for 100 bucks and a free eye exam is a great deal. Especially considering I usually spend 300 on glasses after insurance is said and done. My only complaint is the selection wasn't amazing but what so you expect for such cheap prices.	1
From the previous reviews that I read I know exactly who people are talking about.  I rarely give a one or two stars. The customer service here is horrible.  I feel like everything I say is wrong.  I felt rushed when selecting my frames.  They changed me $10 more than what the price was marked on the frame.  When I pointed that out I got an attitude.	0
"Edit:  A customer service representative from the central office called me and was able to arrange a refund with the manager of the Pittsburgh location. Still, I think this location only deserves one star, considering one of their employees actually lied to me about the return policy, saying all sales were final, while another one said \""I don't know what you're talking about\"" when I tried to explain my problem. Very poor customer service at this location. \n\nDespite what it says on their website (30-day return policy), this location refuses to take returns, even for a defective product. I got a set of eyeglasses here which have reflections all across the field of vision. They're barely usable due to this. If I sit near a bright window, I have three reflections which show up in each lens.  These reflections go directly across the center of my field of vision.  $200 down the drain. Buyer beware."	0
I stepped into the Pennsylvanian as I was scouting wedding reception locations. There is really no space like it in Pittsburgh. \n\nIt sits on this little hill in the heart of Pittsburgh, the corner of Liberty and Grant. The giant rotunda is just magical and the grand hall is beautiful. There are offices in the back - which is annoying because the offices windows surround the grand hall. \n\nDownsides. Of all the venues I visited the staff was the most rigid - there are a ton of rules, no drapery (aka the office windows never go away), liability insurance, music off by 1130. \n\nNeedless to say I booked my reception there - I can work around the rules.	1
I find the Pittsburgh Saks to be friendlier than Saks in many other cities.\n\nIt's always a joy to talk to the people working at the perfume counter. They are very willing to let you sniff different kinds of perfumes; they patiently wait for you to make a decision; and they are perfectly pleasant even if your final decision is to not buy anything; they will still give you free samples if they have some.\n\nThe sales clerk in the dresses section is also helpful. I once had to buy a dress in a hurry, and the person assisting me picked out three candidates (all on sale) and offered me her honest opinion about which one looked good on me. No attitude at all.\n\nOverall, I find shopping at Saks a better experience than shopping at the Macy's nearby.	1
I think someone at Sak's Corporate read my last review. They have rearranged and updated the men's floor! They moved the shoes to a more open and flowing location. They have also taken out the house ware section and have converted it into a Hugo Boss section that is huge! Louis Vuitton is now gone as of January 31, 2010 and was replace by a handbag wall. They left because Sak's wouldn't update their area. I am so sad to see them leave! They have a stand alone store in near by Ross Park Mall.\n\nNow if only they could redo the whole store.	1
Fair well old friend. You will be greatly missed. After being in downtown Pittsburgh for 60 years, Saks Fifth Avenue is now closed. :(	1
"Don't waste your time.1- they dont sell regular paper and hardly have poster paper.2- its really hard to find any thing of use. Most things are archaic and not in a cool vintage way.3- the owner is a bitch. During park(ing) day 2010 she waited 3 hours before coming out and telling the artist \"" i find what you are doing is discussing. I dont support your tree hugger shit....\"" extraordinarily rude."	0
"I went here around noon one day in search of an ink pad, which I thought would be a pretty standard item for a stationery store.  (Turns out I was wrong.)  The store was such a cramped, crowded mess that I had to ask for help to find what I was looking for, but was hesitant to do so because I felt so awkward interrupting the four employees sitting at a table in a corner, eating leftover pasta and engrossed in conversation, ignoring me and the several other customers who were browsing.  When I finally got the courage to ask about the ink pad, the workers all looked at each other as if to say \""Who's going to handle this?\"" before one of them grudingly got up to search for an ink pad that, as it turned out, \""didn't come in with the shipment\"".  As if Pittsburgh was a hot market for ink pads and they go through their entire supply every week."	0
I stopped in because they have knitting supplies. I immediately saw a beautiful cat (they have several in this shop). Being a owner of several cats and extreme lover of all animals, I went over to see the cat. The cat let me pet it and followed me around yowling for attention. I picked up the cat to hold and the man that works there was very rude and ripped the cat away from me. I will NEVER NEVER go back to a store that treats animals or animal lovers that way. The shop isn't that great anyway.	0
Charming store with high quality items.  I've purchased business cards and placesetting cards. The staff was very attentive and detail oriented. Great customer service.	1
Calzones are excellent. Highly recommended, very filling and cheap. Pizza is good but not great. Can't beat the price in downtown Pittsburgh, 16 inch for $10.50. Been here four times in two weeks	1
Great pricing on food! A hoagie, fries, & drink is $6 & some change. They have different daily specials for each day of the week. Monday= 6in meatball... wed =I love the buffalo chicken horead agie and chicken parm hoagie. Their calzones look good. I often order a cash fry (chicken, fries and melted mozzarella cheese. You can add veggies for a small price) Also, if they seem full downstairs, the entire 2nd floor is seating. No worries!	1
Not worth your money.  Poor service, worn interior, A/C was non-functional, THE CD PLAYER DIDN'T WORK, AND THERE WAS NO AUXILIARY JACK.\n\nThey get two start because they managed to get us from Point A to Point B without making us fear for our lives.	0
"You just gotta have a Peppi's hoagie...especially on your way to a Steelers game.  The guy stands under the bridge near Reedsdale shouting, \""Peppi's.....hoagies....\""  They are damn good.  Talk it into the stadium and enjoy :)"	1
I found a short black curly hair in my basket of fries... and it was definitely not mine.\n\nNeedless to say, this completely ruined my meal. Thanks to Peppi's, I won't be eating anything that isn't ready-to-eat as is (like fruit) for the next few days.\n\nNot only does the shop LOOK grimey, it IS grimey... Completely disgusted.	0
Best Espresso Hands down. Makes me want to hop on a plane and come home for a weekend just to wake up on a Sunday and hear italian men next to me while I sip my espresso machiatto.	1
It's actually not bad! Scared by the lattes at their CMU site last year, I have been hastened to come to La Prima. \nSince I am now creating a latte in PGH list, it is somewhat unfair to not come giving them a chance at all.\nI am actually not disappointed by the cap I got here, nutty and mild. It's a bit too dark roasted for me in that I cannot really taste/smell the characteristics of the beans, but nothing obviously disappointing in general. :)\nThe environment is not that welcoming for staying.	1
I went down to the strip last week and thought a mocha sounded great. Well I can't write a review on that drink because the employee dropped a dime in my drink. I was expecting her to offer to make me a new one since she was the one the dropped it in there, but instead all I got a was blank stare. \n\nThe coffee shop down the street had great coffe and they don't drop anything in there as well.	0
One of my good friends introduced me to La  Prima back in the late 90's.  They had storefront on liberty  between what I believe was a movie rental joint and  an indie theater.  Simply amazing terra cotta type ceiling... \n\nHaving recently visited the strip district location. I can confirm that 10 years later the coffee is still frigging amazing.  \n\nI'd describe the house blend as unique, and balanced. Sumatra  bold but not overbearing.  And you'll need to check another review for latte frappa cappuccino.	1
The best place for coffee!!! I love everything about this place.. The atmosphere, the neighborhood feel, the baristas, and the patrons (especially the little Italian men sitting outside playing cards drink espressos). A huge favorite place in my book!!!	1
La Prima is an excellent, no nonsense coffee shop.  It gets very crowded on Saturdays, but I always try to stop in for a double espresso.  You're not going to want to bring your computer.	1
Oh how sad. \n\nFull of younger kids who don't really know that gay doesn't need to be synonymous with slutty or bitchy. \n\nBig dance floor area, and a bar quartered off by a chain link fence (for real). Sigh. \n\nKind of what you don't want a gay bar to be.	0
Basically, if you don't need a fake ID to get in/aren't interested in pedophilia ... don't bother.	0
We used to call this place Tons of Sluts.\nBecause pretty much, that's what it is.  \nThere's a fence that fences you into the bar... it's.. ridiculous. \nIt's not cheap.\nI only went for drag shows.  But if you're looking for a wild drag show and cheap drinks head to Blue Moon in L-Ville on Butler Street	0
I am so absolutely disappointed that Pegasus closed! The name has been around for so long and many people know of it, even if they've never stepped foot in it. Pegasus was an amazing bar/club to go to to dance, socialize and roam their 3-4 floors. The dance floor was spacious and there were so many places to go if you grew tired of dancing! I never had one bad night at Pegasus! Every night there was an amazing adventure! The staff was great and the people there were so much fun! I met some great people there and the crowd was almost always friendly and fun. I really hope that Pegasus comes back because Pittsburgh needs it!	1
I've been coming to this salon for about 8 years now and have never had an issue.  I have to suggest my own hairdresser JoJo, who does a fantastic job working with my curly hair.  It's always nice to chat and joke around with her while you're getting beautified!\n\nOther services I've had done are nails and waxing, which have also been a great experience.  A Brazilian wax may never be a comfortable thing to go through, but I've been seeing Amy and she has always tried to make ripping out hair as painless as possible:)\n\nAll the people who work there are incredibly friendly, and make you feel very comfortable while you're there....even offering up the owners homemade red wine to sip while they style!	1
After years of hoping from one hair salon to the next, I finally settled on Cardamone's. This salon caters to customers of all ages and types from Downtown businessmen to students at the nearby Point Park University. The styling tools and products are top of the line and always leave my hair with a beautiful finish. The staff are very friendly, especially my stylist Marisa.	1
"I'd had a nail appointment set for several weeks - a first time customer.  Less than an hour before the appointment I got a call canceling it.  Not from the owner apologizing for the cancellation or trying to correct the situation somehow, but from the nail tech.  She told me the owner insisted that SHE call her clients herself to tell them she had \""personal problems\"" that day and couldn't make it.  Wow.  The lack of professionalism astounded me.  \n\nOn the positive side, I'm glad I had the experience BEFORE what may have been the worst nail experience of my life.  Imagine how the \""personal problems\"" may have affected the work.  I called the salon to let them know of my disappointment in being left high and dry.  They simply didn't care.  They lost a customer....not just for nails, but for all the other services they offer.  Not the best way to run a \""service\"" business!"	0
"We came here to see the play \""You say Tomato I Say Shut Up!\"" and what fun we had! The stage is visible from any seat, the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying. We really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking. Great time and we can't wait to come back for another show."	1
Excellent casual business lunches - salads, sandwiches - always freshly prepared and consistent quality.  Family owned.	1
The only Chinese supermarket in Pittsburgh. Thank goodness it's well stocked. Unfortunately it's a 30 minute bus ride from school and hauling the goods back is not easy. I feel most at home here, it even smells Asian!	1
Best Asian grocery in Pittsburgh. Went shopping for ingredients for a Korean dish I was making and they had everything. Food is fresh also!	1
Pittsburgh is unusually lacking any good Asian grocers. This was the closest I could find and compared to the ones in Philadelphia this can't even compete. However, considering that it's Pittsburgh, this is probably the best Asian store around. \nWhile the location is a little far I am willing to trek all the way to Lotus for a few ingredients that only they have in stock! It holds all sorts of miscellaneous food stuffs that I am always dying to try. \n\nThe prices are pretty good and I always leave spending 10 dollars less than I thought I'd spend. \n\nThey have tofu there that is really really cheap! It is also a little questionable how they serve it but, I've never denied myself some discount tofu. \n\nWhile the baked goods there temptingly cheap - they are not fresh so I'd stay away from those. \n\nOverall I'd say that I need to go for another lotus run	1
A good store to pick up your East Asian cooking ingredients. There is a large selection of sauces, oils, and noodles. They also carry rice which you can buy in bulk. The freezer section is quite large, but I'm not too sure about what sort of freezer goods they sell. They also have produce which is on par with the other vendors in the strip. Lastly, there is a small fresh fish section in the back.	1
If I can give haft a star I would. Never shop at this Asian grocery since Many more open. Owner and employee alike no manners and nasty. Sorry guys it's the truth.	0
Love this store! It absolutely stinks, but the prices and the foods you find here you won't be able to find anywhere else. Has the best sweet chili sauce. Beware though, rarely anything has english labels on it.	1
I needed a sweater rewoven and Lulu did an awesome job.  She was apologetic about being backed up wtih work, but I wasn't in a hurry. Pricing is very reasonable and she is very competent with her work.  I would highly recommend this business.	1
We were in pursuit of a simple pant leg alteration.  \n\nLulu is super sweet and clearly highly in demand (especially for re weaving and re knitting items).  It appears she does most of reweaving and her mom helps out with more simple alterations and such.  \n\nPants were hemmed well and it was good work.  We have already gone back with another clothing repair.  I would fully trust Lulu and her shop with any alteration we would need in the future.  \n\nShe is located on the 5the floor of the Investment Building.	1
"As Lindsay's best friend and maid of honor, I went with her to Jim Ludwig's a few weeks before her wedding to go over the final order for the flowers.  We sat down and Jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed.  I very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces.  Not only do I know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement, but I was also at the consultation to witness the discussion.  The centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested - no peonies OR dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding.  In no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day, but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed.  I don't understand how there was a \""miscommunication\"" as I saw the paperwork.  I just know that I won't be using Jim Ludwig's for any of my own special occassions."	0
Jim Ludwig's did the flowers for my wedding, and we were extremely pleased with the whole process. The initial consultation was thorough, we received the proposal promptly afterward, it was easy to make revisions, and they were very responsive throughout. They delivered to three different locations for us on the morning of the wedding, and Jim personally pinned the boutonnieres on the groomsmen and handed the bouquets to the bridesmaids, and gave us buckets of water to refresh them with during the photos and had Tim meet us at the ceremony to trim the stems right before we walked down the aisle so the flowers would look their best. The centerpieces at the reception were gorgeous.\n\nWe've also used them for several bouquets on other special occasions, and they always do a great job - we can just tell them what we'd like to spend and they make suggestions and deliver the flowers promptly and looking great.	1
My second time here.  Just purchased a Briggs & Riley briefcase.  Less than 1/2 price of a Tumi bag I looked at, but better.\n\nGreat selection, knowledgeable staff, good location.  They also repair luggage--even Tumi store won't do that.  If you're proud of being a Pittsburgher, you should be buying as much as you can from a _Pittsburgh_ store!	1
What a great store! Dean the owner/manager was extremely knowledgeable and helpful about which backpack was best for me.  Very generous 30-day return policy and a wide selection of travel accessories as well as luggage. A must visit if you need luggage and want to support local businesses, especially the few who are left Downtown.	1
This is a tiny place tucked into some snazzy downtown complex. Its cheap for downtown, and the portions are generous, so I suggest getting only the smaller sizes.\n\nI had a rice and beans burrito, and they let you take one of their hot sauces to the table. I asked for something really hot, and I actually got it. This is surprising for Pittsburgh, because I've noticed overall the town is weak on spice (even the Thai restaurants). \n\nAnyway, the beans in the burrito were fresh and cooked perfectly, and the rice was also plump and lightly spiced. The place is tiny and clean, and I got in and out for under five dollars for lunch.   \n\nThis place is really a gem--its cash only though, so bring that with you.  Good find. A lot better than some of the other places higher up on the list.	1
Hands down my favorite burrito in the greater Pittsburgh region. The owner always remembers my order when I show up: beans and cheese with rice, size 'chico' (though there's nothing chico about it). It's flavorful, fresh, and filling. I also recommend the taco salad, and the tacos themselves. The only item I've had that was less than thrilling was the vegetarian quesadilla... a little heavy on the cheese. But the rest is so good that an average dish has no bearing on my overall rating. Eating here is a must.	1
Food was only just ok and service was even worse.\n\nThere's plenty of other places you can go to for breakfast  - even Eat'N'Park would be better but hit up a place like Ritter's instead.	0
"Well, it's food!! That's about all I can say for The Smithfield Cafe.  \nI had the \""daily special\"" which is pretty much the universal way of condensing \""two eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast\"" into two words. Sausage was room temperature, eggs were decent, and the greasy home fries contained the flavor of the dozen meals that were cooked before mine this morning (not i'n a good way). Coffee was plentiful, but not flavorful. \nThe waitresses were grizzled and archetypal for their profession.  \nTo surmise; meh..."	0
I don't know why this place got such low ratings but I was pleased. I am not used to a place with cheap and good breakfast... I mean $6 got me eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes. It wasn't the best but it was really good.\n\nI thought the service was really good as well. If they had this place in Cali I would probably eat there more often. Much better but the same price as Mc Donald's.	1
It's been a crazy week in my office, what with it being the end of our fiscal year and all.  So I just had to get me out and have me some good old comfort food for lunch today.  Alone!\n\nSo I had me a good ol' fashioned cheeseburger and fries with some coleslaw.  It really hit the spot so I'm upping my rating to four stars.	1
"I'm taking a megabus today, so I looked on Yelp for a good spot to eat in Downtown Pittsburgh, and so I went here based on the reviews of other yelpers, and my goodness, the burgers here ARE Awesome! Thanks Yelpers!!! The fries came out piping hot, and the server was really friendly. The cook even came out to double check how one of the customers really wanted her burger. When the cook came out, he said \""I just love to cook\"" so there's love that goes into this food.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a good burger. I haven't tried any of the other food, but I'm sure it's good.\n\nDefinitely a good quick spot for good food."	1

J'adore this store!!!  So beautiful and filled with many inspiration pieces. Very much on the pricey side, but a check online shows me that their stock is not too overpriced. This is def a room in heaven. :)	1
"Two words: \""Potpourri heaven\"" \n\nI love stopping in to this business every time I find myself in the Strip District. The front entrance, interior and back patio look like something out of a whimsical dried flower wonderland. You'll find everything from single stem flowers to create your own arrangements to paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dog heads for decoration. The back patio filled with plants and water features is definitely one of the highlights during the warmer months. \n\nPrices can be on the higher side so if you don't find yourself making a grand purchase, inspiration is certainly guaranteed upon exiting the business. \n\nA few other items you'll find at this business: wreaths, terrariums, crafting books, beautiful stationery, and fun garland."	1
I love  Andy and he loves me. \n\nI used to come here every Sunday after church and order his special not on the menu rolls. Those are awesome.  They are really fresh and flavorful.	1
Andy's sushi bar is a convenient little stand set up inside Wholly's in the Strip District of Pittsburgh. It's not a dine in type of place, but it is the best sushi I've ever had. \n\nWholly's sells fresh fish and other meats, so a very convenient place for a sushi bar. My personal favorite of Andy's is the Philadelphia roll - without hot sauce! \n\nI used to work in the strip and would often walk down to Wholly's just to get sushi and talk to Andy.	1
fish is about as fresh as you will find in Pittbsurgh. Andy makes waiting in line a joy. Very generous portion sizes, and unbelievable value (2 large pieces of toro for $5 is unheard of! Not to mention I was given a third 1 at no additional cost)\n\nThe presentation itself leaves something to be desired, not the most skilled with a knife, but the guy has to pump them out fast enough to keep the line moving. - and lets be honest, you're not going to a stand in wholeys for presentation.\nHis special sauce is tasty, some sort of sirracha-esq conccoction, but make sure you make note of it if you don't want this on your fish.\nUses a bit too much rice for my liking on the nigiri pieces, I think he could use about half as much. Though I understand he is located next to a primantis, and this is pittsburgh.\n\nFantastic value, great guy. Will return.\n\noh, and I really mean he's a great guy beyond the generosity with the fish. Today he temporarily stopped service to help a little girl find her mother.	1
I want to like it.  But ultimately, it took forever to get and he doused my sushi with various sauces that were NOT listed on the menu.  As a condiment-o-phobic, my sushi was ruined and I didn't feel comfortable enough to request it be fixed.  \n\n15$ later, I tossed it and walked out, miserable.	0
i would give andy 6 stars, if possible due to:\n1. amaaaaaaazing sushi.\n2. hilarious conversation.\n3. fresh, fresh, fresh ingredients.\n4. reasonable prices for the quality of food (which is stellar).\n5. andy's daily specials & inventive use of random sushi components (like mango & mint).\n6. FREE SAMPLES while you wait in line.\n\nandy is the best -- hands-down.	1
AAahhh.  Why do I have such a discordance with Pittsburgh Yelpers' opinions of sushi places?  This place is not 4 stars.  The long line -- one person, Andy, making the sushi, makes you think it's a gem in the Strip District.  Eh.\n\nWith Andy's Special, there was a variety of rolls, and made with a continuous strip of seawood (ie inside on one roll, outside on the next), which I actually found annoying, as the rolls fell apart when trying to separate them.  There just wasn't any flavor -- so I laid on the soy sauce and wasabi, but to no avail.\n\nI'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments.	0
I'm sorry, but as cool as Andy is, I just don't like the sushi.  The tuna tasted metallic and mealy, definitely not fresh.  I actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite.  The portions are large, yes, and the prices are good, but I'd rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspect.	0
As much as a sushi fan as I am I going to stick my neck out and say this is the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Here is my reasoning.\n\nAndy is not just a funny guy, but is very generous.  Go when it's not busy and be prepared to be handed big chunks of raw fish with his different sauces.  Talk to him and get ready for sushi rolls bursting with fresh fish.  \nNext the place is in Wholey Fish Market, Wholey gets fresh fish daily, so you know his sushi is going to be some of the freshest in Pittsburgh.\nFinally, the price, load up on Andy's rolls and sashimi for the fairest price in the city.  Try Andy's roll and the Eel sashimi.\n\nGo see Andy for some great sushi and sashimi.	1
Andy is super entertaining, and serves up the best sushi in the burg!  Don't miss!	1
First, do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible. That pissed me right off. \nSecond, the rolls here are sloppy. Not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite), but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go. After my experience with the toro, I don't think I will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try. While the rolls are large, the prices were quite steep, not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood.	0
Check your candy purchase for FRESHNESS!  I bought 4 boxes of marshmallow cones.  I carried them on a plane to Dallas TX for my adult niece.  When she opened one of the individually wrapped cones, the marshmallow top was as hard as meringue.  I was embarrassed that I gave her old candy that was just purchased days before.  When I returned to pittsburgh I called Fort Pitt.  They said they couldn't do anything unless I returned the candy.  No apology, no concern.  I will not shop there again.  You can find fresh cones and candy at other stores.	0

Being a Korean-BBQ lover and snob..I needed to get my Bulgogi/gal-bi fix when I was in Pittsburgh.  My search led me to Sushi-Kim.\n\nOh how I wish it led me astray.  This was probably one of the worst tasting Korean Barbecue places I have ever been to.  The beef was not the right color and was basically bland.  The beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough.  I felt like I had to chew each piece 100x or I was going to choke and die.  \n\nI was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone.	0
"I wouldn't call this place authentic Korean BBQ. I was disappointed that the \""grill\"" at the table was essentially a frying pan. How can you even come close to delicious Korean BBQ if there is no open flame? Every other BBQ restaurant I've been to has had either charcoal or gas grill.\n\nThe quality of the meats were terrible, though one shouldn't really expect much from a buffet.\n\nI will say, however, that the service was friendly and accommodating. It's spacious, and thus great for large groups of people. Just don't expect fantastic Korean BBQ."	0
"Yelp didn't exist when I used to go here, back in the CMU days, but it is still my favorite Soon Du Bu (Tofu Stew) place - we just LOVED it.  We never ate sushi here, always the korean food.  The hae mul pah jun is yummy, the dol sol bibimbap is good, but the soon du bu jige is the best.  It's run by Koreans, hello!  \n\nWe were lucky to have this place in Pittsburgh - it's not like there was a lot to choose from.  But even now, I rarely encounter a place (in the Bay Area) that has the same quality of tofu stew - and we have a \""k-town\"" here!"	1
A few friends from out of town wanted to meet at Sushi Kim for dinner, so I agreed. The sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes, while their kids liked the miso soup, and edamame beans (which were replenished when asked). \n\nI'm not a fan of Japanese food, so I stuck with the Korean selections, after all I was in a Korean restaurant! I had Mandu Guk, which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings, and broth. My daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked, but we've had better. The pork was really greasy, and not cooked on a fire grill, no char marks, equals less than tasty meat. \n\nSushi Kim alternates between a hit, or a miss. Sometimes you get a few different panchan, (side dishes of pickled or marinated vegetables), and sometimes you only get kimchi, wth? If you judge a place by it's patrons, I've seen few Koreans eat here, so that sums up the authenticity factor. Nice big restaurant, just lacking in overall experience.	0
Ew! Ew! Gross! I know that's not the most mature thing to say, but that's what comes to mind when I think about this place! Sad thing is, I've been here a couple times. Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!	0
You can not pay me money to eat here again. They cannot even cook edamame, it was undercooked and cold. I had to stop eating their sushi in fear I would be sick for work in the morning. Texture and temperature of the fish scared me. Save yourself pain and throw your money out the window. Only plus side was their friendliness in service.	0
Absolutely the worst sushi my husband and I have ever had.  It was Gross!!! I don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place!	0
I'm new to Pittsburgh with a job on the North Shore. I had a craving for some Korean food and went to the place nearest my office - Sushi Kim in the Strip District that boasts both Korean food and sushi.\n\nLet me say up front - the food I received was delicious. But, I was a bit disappointed with the portion size for my lunch entree. For $12.95, I received just a few portions of ribs (I ordered the kalbi), just 3 ban-chan (side dishes of kimchi, sprouts and broccoli), a small serving of white rice and a miso soup.\n\nDelicious food, small portions and a bit overpriced.  I was thinking of coming back to try to sushi, but I think the price structure needs to be reworked before I return.	0
"one of my favorite restaurants! This is by far the richest bolgolgi I have ever tasted. The staff is the friendliest, Michael is my favorite waiter..super funny! Yes, I am slightly bias because I am Korean but its great food. It's def more on the pricey side I would say compared to most Korean places. I always order the fried pork dumplings and beef bolgolgi. It's obviously cheaper during lunch but I feel that the portions are rather small in the \""box\"" your food comes in. I'm not impressed with their alcohol selection, they need more mixed drinks! I have never tried the sushi so can't comment on that. I do wish it was more of the traditional Korean BBQ. They bring a small cooker to your table and make it but still isn't the same. Nonetheless food is great, this place is def worth checking out."	1
I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe food is okay.. service is mediocre and staff ... not the friendliest :)\n\nSo, if anyone asks me to recommend a good korean or a sushi place... you can say this will definitely not make the list.	0
In the past, when I was still living in Pittsburgh, we would go here for the Korean BBQ almost every weekend. I have since found out that it is extremely difficult to get in as it is always reserved by one large group or another (I'm calling you out CMU Korean Student Association). Maybe I'm just unlucky with the timing of my visits. \n\nRegardless, I find it hard to believe the upstairs is exactly filled by these groups. Rather I think they are actually allowing them to reserve the whole floor, which is unfortunate and bad long term business IMO.\n\nThe menu food is OK, a tad expensive, and there are better places.\n\nI'll reluctantly give 4 stars since I haven't actually been able to eat here in over a year (Maybe next time I'm coming to Pittsburgh I will call ahead and put in a reservation, but other Yelpers seem to indicate they will push you out in favor of larger reservations).	1
I make it a point to walk down to suski Kim when I'm shopping in the strip district.  I love there sushi.  If you like hot make sure you get the after death roll with an habenero sauce.  It spicy but not going to kill you,  actually has great flavor.  Service is always great anytime I've been there.  Be sure if your craving sushi when in the strip take the walk down.  Only about 5 min past wholeys!	1
Staff are friendly. Sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better. Otherwise this is a decent sushi place for a lunch once in a while.	0
I had a lunch there once. The food is ok but it's on the pricy side. I don't think I will be back.	0
There are much better sushi choices available.  This place is just okay, but I like sushi to be spectacular.  The employees were lots of fun, they had the best sense of humor, and the service was excellent. The prices were very good.\n\nI was there on a Monday, so I just tried the sushi.  I might go back for the Korean BBQ.	0
Don't bother with the sushi, can't speak to the Korean BBQ.\n\nLong story short: I ordered delivery. Never had sushi delivered before, so maybe this is just the way it goes, but it took almost two hours to get to me. There was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree I'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag. Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them, I just threw out the tuna roll, which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good, but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. \n\nMaybe this is better when you dine in. Still, would not recommend. Pricey and doesn't live up to it at all.	0
Being Korean and my kids and I visit all the Korean restaurants when we are out of town.  Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.  Their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat?  Will not go back.	0
I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.  That should have tipped me off.  The last time i was there i had a bad meal, but i wanted to give them another shot.  \n\nI ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu.  I believe is was L1......Numbered menu items.....Another tip.   My food was terrible.  The miso soup was horrid and old, the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!	0
I don't give 2 stars that often but sorry Kim - you were a bitter disappointment. \n\nI was excited to have found a Sushi place in Pittsburgh in walking distance to my apartment. That excitement didn't last for too long when I entered the place on a Monday evening at 7pm, realizing that I was the only one in a rather spacious restaurant.\n\nFine, I had a Sushi craving and couldn't care less. Until the Sushi arrived. I ordered my Spicy Tuna and Salmon rolls, both came within 2 minutes. Strange? Maybe, or just a super fast chef. Sadly, the rolls were falling apart as soon as I looked at them, and the Salmon even tasted... bad. I had to leave it on the plate, which has never happened to me before.\n\nOn the plus side, the miso soup was okay and the service was very attentive, which is not surprising if you're the only one in that place. As there are not too many Korean options in Pittsburgh I encourage you to try the Korean BBQ, especially as the reviews for the Korean food at Kim's on Yelp are not that bad. But for the Sushi - forget it.	0
Tried this place based on reviews in local paper and friends. This place was awful. We asked questions of the server and ordered based on them. Neither was good.y friend said she cannot eat real spicy food and asked them to tone it down. Her meal was so hot she couldn't eat it.  Mine was just disappointing. The only thing I found good was the plain rice. I also thought it was extremely over priced. Will not return.	0
"I saw Shakespeare's \""As You Like It\"". Great performance!"	1
We went to the Pittsburgh Public Theater last weekend for a show and I was very impressed with the facilities.  I really like the horse shoe seating the engulfs the stage, and the experience of looking down on the actors.  I also thought the staff was extremely helpful and the actors at the theater were really impressive.  We had no problem getting in and out, ordering a drink quickly at intermission, and receiving directions on where to find our seats.  I like this theater a lot and plan on many return visits.\n\nThe only small drawback is the seats were incredibly uncomfortable for me.  Maybe it was because we were in the balcony and had to turn our bodies at a 45degree angle which would smash your legs again the arm rest, or you could just turn your neck but either way it wasn't real comfy.  I hope in the future we can get a seat more in the middle perhaps alleviating this small issue.  \n\nOverall this is just another great addition to the Pittsburgh's cultural district.	1
The location is nice, with plenty of outdoor seating on the river. The food is not that great.  They have an all you can eat crab leg dinner.  My husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked.  I had a crab cake sandwich in which I could not really taste the crab.  \n\nPrices:  Sandwiches ~$10, Entrees, ~$18, Crab legs, $25.	0
"Great place to get a drink on the deck and watch the river traffic, but that's the only good point of the place.  Food's okay - nothing to write home about; service is pretty average and a bit unfriendly; decor is a little too \""tacky nautical\"".  Prices are pretty average, but too high for the quality and service levels."	0
Pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining, so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day. Have a drink and enjoy the deck, but save your dining budget for somewhere else.  The menu is blah and the food is also.\n\nI recently had lunch here, and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely, bringing food to everyone else at the table.  When I reminded her, she returned with my clam chowder, spilled it, didn't apologize, and didn't clean it up.  All that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good.	0
Awful service, overpriced food. Don't waste your money! On arrival, waitress seemed lost.  Ordered food for 3 adults, one kid, food came for adults, after a couple of minutes my mom asked when my sons food would be coming, waitress said she would check, came back and said his pizza hadnt been cooked yet. Cancelled the pizza, paid $4 for a little bowl of white lettuce with some cheese thrown on it, fried shrimp was expense, but looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp. Spoke to manager, who had a horrible attitude and found out that the waitress never put the pizza order in for my son and then lied and told the manager he wasnt at the table when we ordered our food. If you give these people your money, it would be foolish!	0
Ate this yesterday and was very impressed with the atmosphere and scenery, but that was about it. The wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor. I figured seafood would be their bread and butter but their Ahi tuna was tasteless. The salads you get with an entree is the size of a dixie cup and the lettuce is cheap iceburgh crap. If I go back again I will def just order beer and appetizers as the Buffalo shrimp were pretty good. If showing someone the city this is a good place for atmosphere but if you're a food critic check your taste buds at the door.	0
I love the location, and I keep trying to give Redfin Blues a chance, but the food is always average at best and the service is less than mediocre.  The setting is fabulous, there's a bike trail that runs right through the middle of the restaurant and you can sit right along the river and feel like you are in some exotic location.  I still enjoy eating here on occasion, but I always keep my expectations low about the food and service.  Maybe one day that will change.	0
It's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer. It's outdoor dining is right on the river, hovering above Washington's Landing Marina. However, the service is seriously lacking. With my parent's boat docked right below Redfin's, we frequently dine here before headed out on the water. The service has always been very slow. I understand that on a typical Friday or Saturday night it can get rather busy, but they should anticipate the crowd and be able to plan accordingly to accommodate! Luckily, the view is so nice that most of the time we're left waiting....and waiting....and waiting....it isn't too big of a deal because we're enjoying the outdoor space. \n\nThe food is average. Nothing I've had there was to die for, but on the same token, nothing was awful either. I'd only suggest this place to marina-goers or those looking for a nice outdoor dining space. Oh, and only come if you have lots of time!	0
average at best. Best view of the city by far though. Go in summer or no point in going. \n\nThe beer battered fish is good, yet there's much better in the city. It's nice and crispy, served on a fresh roll, tartar, lettuce, all that jazz. However again it's not worth venturing over for unless weather is perfect for an evening outside. \n\nChicken quesidilla, same thing. Average. \n\nI've went for 6 years now waiting for it to become something good. It's not going to happen. But I'll keep trying hoping.	0
"Dear Redfin Blues,\n\nI can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the \""list\"". To which she replied \""what list?\"" And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up."	0
"Just returned from RFBlues, where I usually enjoy myself quite a lot.\n\nThe bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer. No big\ndeal; pink salmon looks a lot like white chicken, assuming she's\ncolorblind. I waited.\n\nAnd had a 2nd drink.\n\nAnother group of 3 people came in after that, ordered their meals, and\ngot served their entrees.\n\nI went up to the bartender and asked when my dinner would be coming.\nShe announced that \""salmon takes longer to cook\"" (than what??? a raw\nsalad? I cook; salmon is one of the fastest things on earth to cook!),\nand that \""I was about to check on that...\"" It had been over an hour by\nnow.\n\nI got my sandwich promptly after complaining.\n\nA few minutes later, when I finished my salmon, I got my side of\nvegetables (apparently vegetables take even longer than salmon to\ncook!).\n\nAll sarcasm aside: one screw up is tolerable. The second - forgetting\nto even check on my late order until I complained, an hour after I\nordered, is not. And yet, I wasn't given the least consideration in\nthe bill."	0
A little pricy for food but not too bad. Sitting above the little docks there is nice on a hot day. When they put the boats in the water it's a little noisy but entertaining. I had a fish sandwich and it was a little greasy and bland and the tartar sauce was also bland. Iced tea was good. This is not the place to come to have a good meal, but a nice view and a breeze then it's ok. Next time I think I will just get drinks and an appetizer and enjoy the view.\nOther people I see complained about the service but our waitress was really good and took care of us without hovering.	0
Completely chill environment. I pretty much always get the chicken quesadilla which is awesome, so I really can't comment on anything else. The prices are good and the service is quick.	1
It was my Anniversary tonight, a Tuesday. I was so excited to get All You Can Eat Crab  Legs!!! My favorite food of all time!!! But when we arrived at 8:20pm, the very unfriendly waitress said that their kitchen was closed!!!!! BOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Their website, as well as Yelp, states that they are open until 10pm!!! We would've been long gone by then! Very disappointing. Well, we ended up driving a lot farther than we intended, but had a wonderful dinner at Joe's Crab Shack in Station Square. I got my LEGS!!!! And they had $2 Hurricanes to boot!!! Ended up eating a better meal, with cheaper drinks, and we ended up tipping our waiter 30% because he was awesome!!!! Should've just gone there in the first place! I will know better from now on!!!	0
The food can be ok.. So can the service.. If you come by boat or bike make sure you are fully clothed.. They may look at you like you are nuts if you show up in a bathing suit.. For every 2 good waitresses there is 1 good.. I like the beer battered chicken sandwich.. The shrimp quesadilla had weird textured shrimp.. The peel and eat shrimp are pretty good..	0
Hot Haute Hot = Love Luv Loooove	1
This store has great stuff in it and we all complemented the woman working on how great the store was when we were leaving. I was with 3 white people and 1 black person. When we left, the worker pulled the black person aside and demanded to check his pockets. She did and found nothing. In the middle of the Strip District, this store can still be racist?	0

Rotten food and over charging customer.\n\nI was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant, but was greatly disappointed. The restaurant charged me 20% premium over prices on online menu (I ordered takeout), denied there are prices online. The maitre D was reluctant to show the printed menu, which is 10% more expensive than online, led me to think the over charge was deliberate. \nThe crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from ROTTEN crab. Since I didn't have time to walk 10min one way to return the food, it had to be thrown away.   A lunch over charged and wasted.	0
Had dinner here on a weeknight before taking my daughter to the nutcracker.  It was dead, but we were early on a Tuesday night, and it picked up.  \n\nWe started with the fried zucchini.  The consensus was thumbs up.  Bread was average.\n\nI ordered the veggie pasta.  Asked for it w/out zucchini but was told it wasn't possible as it was pre-made.  It was ok.\n\nMy daughter had the cheese raviolis and enjoyed them.\n\nThe other three people had the seafood platter special.  Didn't go so well.  The shrimp and scallops were good, the sole was ok, but  all three sent theirs back because the lobster wreaked of ammonia.  Our waiter appeared overwhelmed by having to serve a bad product, and was only semiapologetic.  They then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine.\n\nService was average at best.  Feel bad given how long it has been around, but it is hard to imagine making a return trip.	0
They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine.	0
A friend recommended this to me, and I can't figure out why.  The food was underwhelming and pricey.  The service was fine, and the place looked nice, but I can barely remember what I ate there it was so forgettable.	0
"It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \""we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\"" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real."	0
"This place is just a flat out joke.  Totally overpriced.  Went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token 20% \""service\"" fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service.  First I asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside.  Had NO clue what I was talking about.  Finally gave up and got a Coors Lite.  Food was overpriced and less than average.  I had the Baked Scrod.  Exact same dish at Eat N Park is $8.99 and better than this $27 dish.  I would stay clear of this at all costs.  If you are going for a night of theater - opt for eating outside the city or at Sonoma Grill down the street.  I'm shocked this place is still in business."	0
The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables, next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry, sloppy, soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow, inattentive, and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value, a nicer atmosphere, and quality food, I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay.	0
Since closed.  Surprise surprise.	0
I went there after an interview with Highmark. I was satisfied. Nice atmosphere, may be a little pricey for a day to day lunch, but would be a nice treat to yourself every once and a while, My salad was what I expected, Fresh leafy greens and very good house dressing. My meal was enjoyable I got spicy beef dish and it came with potatoes. Dessert was very good. Overall, not a bad place, I would go back.	1
Fairly average Italian food other than the meatballs. Too many good Italian places in Pittsburgh to choose here. Interior could use an update. Beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks.	0
The food quality doesn't match the place at all. I think it's ok for a pub but this place is supposed to be a nice place for professional lunches. \nI had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken! \nWith so many options around that area I won't pick this place for lunch.	0
Located downtown, call Dr. Greg and he can get you in that day, sometimes within the hour.  He's a cool guy, very friendly, and not a new-age, hippy, sales-y doctor like some of the other chiropractors that I've been to.  Accepts insurance & FSA...if you work downtown, I recommend him.	1
Clean fast and the dr is great.   Highly recommend.	1
Dr Greg is great! Staff is very friendly as well. HIGHLY recommend them to you if you work in the downtown pgh area	1
ZERO Stars.  Today, my friend in a wheelchair came in and his friends wanted to sit at the bar for a slice.  They asked if there was an exception to the rule about being at the bar.  The manager told my friend that he could not be accommodated.  That's illegal and immoral and absolutely disgusting.	0
"Villa used to be really good and reasonably priced.  Ever since their facade renovation, addition of a ice cream machine, and maybe even date a little farther back ... the overall offerings are overpriced by about $2.00 per item on average.\n\nThe pizza is good, but if you order during rush hour you're in hit-or-miss territory for quality and temperature.  Hoagies are usually good regardless of how busy they are, it's just a matter of how long it'll take between ordering the hoagie and finally getting to eat said hoagie.  I haven't tried their salads or other dishes ... but for the most part I have heard nothing but positive reviews about their food.\n\nI've never been a huge fan of thin flimsy crusted pizzas ... so while nice sometimes, I continue looking for a nice thick slice of pizza that I can adopt as my \""go-to\"" quick lunch in Downtown Pittsburgh."	0
Update time:  How easy is it to win me back?  Remind me how good your hoagies are, that they're not overpriced like the Pizza is, and then serve me endless glasses of Coke Zero.  That's how!  Villa has regained a fan in me...good hoagies and Coke Zero...SWEET!	1
The canned mushrooms are gone!  Hurray!  Went back today for lunch for a pepperoni and mushroom Calzone.  It was huge!  The price was $12.25 which is a little high for lunch but it was very enjoyable.  The dough is very thick.  This is the best Calzone I have ever had.  It is filled with lots of cheese and toppings.	1
The only good thing this restaurant has going for it, is their bar! \n\nThey have 22oz glasses!!!  and is very close to my job, which is great for an after work drink \n\nThe food is terrible I mean the worse of the worse, I am not a big fan of Italian food and it's because of restaurants like this!! \n\nOn one occasion I made the mistake of ordering food from this restaurant I had tortellini  in a tomato sauce,  I've had better Italian food from a can.\n\nMore is not always better the serving size could easily have fed six grown adults.	0
Meh - it's not that there was anything bad about the pizza, it just didn't blow me away or anything.  Good for a quick lunch at the counter.	0
"Done with this place...  It seems every time we go there they get slower and slower.  Today we waited 50 minutes for a cheese pizza that we never got before walking out.  I complain to the guy making pizzas and he says \""you're not the only one's here\"".... Well, he secured the fact that I will never be back again."	0
This is a great little stop on Smithfield Street.  Frankie the bartender is a major plus and the food across the board is a plus. They offer a wide range of pasta dishes, hoagies, and pizza. I have to recommend the pizza. Though i have tried about a dozen dishes and no complaint. I usually get a slice of pizza and today I added in a side of meatballs. I do want to add you won't be paying a fortune at this place.  The service can get bogged down at lunch but the staff will get you in and out. Try it out and go hungry! I bet you won't spend $10. Bring a few friends and split a pie. ;)	1
I went here on the day of a wedding (I'm from out of town) for a last minute pedicure. I didn't really know where else to go, so I just stopped here on a whim (it was raining and this was the closest place that seemed to do nails). \n\nThe Salon Nuvo nail person is FANTASTIC (and wonderful to chat with). It's two full weeks later and it looks like my pedicure is brand new (and before you ask, I actually used the exact same brand/color nail polish as my prior crap pedicure). They don't have the cool massage chairs and they put you in a weird little intimate back room, HOWEVER I would totally give that up for a beautiful pedicure that lasts this long.  \n\nThought it was worth a review.	1
Definitely recommend this salon! I booked an appointment after having many failed attempts with other stylist that are not able to work with biracial hair. I was frustrated and tired of having the same look because of my unruly mop. I have thick, frizzy, and  curly hair that cannot be tamed easily. The stylist that ended up doing my hair was Chris and she was fantastic! She listened to what I wanted, was fun to talk to, and gave me many helpful tips. I walked out of the salon feeling very satisfied with my new look. Anyone that has biracial hair or children with it should make an appointment with her, you will not be let down!	1
The salon is so dirty we left before I let them cut me hair. The sanitizers were old and half full. The scissors and combs were a mess.  http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-beauty/dr-oz-pedicure-bacterial-infections-dry-pedicure-haircut-ringworm/	0
Horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other Ruth Chris I have been to and I've been to them in 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her. Save your money, this place doesn't deserve to be named Ruth Chris. I've had better steaks at the Outback Steakhouse!!	0
I took my parents here because it's one of their favorite places, but I wasn't that impressed.  The service was impeccable, but the food - not much different than Outback or Texas Roadhouse.	0
I took my girlfriend here for our 6 month anniversary dinner for a nice night out. I had been here several times before but she had not. As per past experience it was a very nice experience with a good wait staff, and wonderful food. As usual I managed to devour every bit of my t-bone. When asked ifnwe were going to have dessert we declined as we decided to go to our favorite dessert place. We were pleasantly surprised when our waitress retrned with a plate which had strawberries and whipped cream, and happy anniversary written in chocolate! Needless to say that was quite wonderfully sweet in a few ways! All in all we will be dining here again.	1
Best Steaks in Pittsburgh!!! I come here a lot for special occasions.  It is a pricy place but it is worth every penny. I had a New York Strip and it was really tender and juicy.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants.  The service is excellent also.	1
"ok I am trying to catch up on my reviews and since coming back from vaca in great SF and I have jetlag with nothing else to at the moment, I am trying to do just that. My husband and I have eaten at RCSH over the years and with each visit the service has gotten increasingly worse! The food is wonderful as always but really with our dinners averaging 200 plus tip I believe the service should be topnotch. What happened RC???? WE LOVE your food but can't justify the prices with service so bad. We should not have to keep looking around for our waiter for a drink refill and we told numerous times we would like bread with our meal and when we brought it up to him, his reply was, \""oh the bread is done yet\"" and no reply about the drinks...sad...too busy talking with the other staff(this did happen last October, before the Yo-yo Ma concert we attended) Hey, maybe they have improved..but ah we are not taking anymore chances with this place!"	0
I took my parents out to celebrate the Christmas season.  My mother ordered the petite filet mignon, which she thought was very good.  The sides we ordered - mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, were also good.  However, my father and I shared the porterhouse for two.  For $90, I would have expected a much better piece of meat.  Flavor was good, but It was tough.  There were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife.  In addition, the presentation was poor.  They put a big plate in the center of the table, then cut up the steak into 10 or 12 cubes.  These cubes were then cooked.  I could have done better at home.	0
I'm really torn by this review. For years and years this was my favorite restarant in the downtown area. We went there last Saturday for dinner and had what I would deem an average meal at exorbitant prices. The salads, while tasty, were much smaller than I had remembered previously.  The side dishes, again, were seemingly smaller to not only me but our party as well. Unfortunately, the worst part of my meal were the steaks. For $45 I received a New York Strip that was WAY overpriced (my wife makes it all the time and much much better) and was, in a word, chewy. The service overall, was quite good, unless you like a car valet (they don't have it). Next time I'll try Morton's or Capital Grille.	0
Good steak if you don't get out much.  Not nearly as good as the price would lead you to believe.  Ruth's Chris will never be a Morton's or a Gibson's.  While Pittsburgh does not have a Gibson's, you should really go to Morton's.  \n\nThe atmosphere is alright, the drinks moderately stiff, and the salad was great...  But one is supposed to come here for steak. \n\nRegrettably, my last two trips (I wasn't paying... hence why I went back) gave me a piece of beef like my late grandma would cook in her oven's broiler with butter.  For a $50 strip, I would expect it to be more like the hand cut, unfrozed meat I make for my grilling parties.  As such, I would rather fire my grill up in December than give Ruth's Chris more money for mediocrity.\n\nGood Talk.	0
Alot of people wrote spot on positive reviews so i will some it up, they are probably the best steak house in Pittsburgh and that is saying something.  Pittsburgh has many good steakhouses.  Go earlier in the week, if your like me you hate waiting but Ruth's is probably the exception if you dont have a resavation. \n\nScore\nFood Quality 5\nService 4\nAtmosphere 4 \nValue 4\nRecommend 5\n\nTier 1	1

Employees were all working hard very nice and conversational.  My family and I enjoyed celebrating my birthday here over the weekend	1
I have eaten at a lot of Ruth's Chris joints.  This was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them.  Apparently not part of the main chain and it shows.   Fail on all levels.  Had to send steak back twice before I just said to hell with it.  Horrible.	0
Ruth Chris Steakhouse is by far one of the best restaurants I've been to in Pittsburgh. Ironically, my family and I avoid eating red meats whenever possible, which seems awkward when dining at a renowned steakhouse. That being said, no red meat platters were placed in front of us.\n\nThe service here is impeccable. The waiters are amazingly helpful, poised, and polite. \n\nThe food we ordered arrived fairly quickly. I got the lobster mac 'n' cheese, my dad ordered chicken, my sister got medium rare fish, my mom ordered a salad, and as sides we all ordered cream spinach and mashed potatoes with garlic. All the foods were flavorful and seasoned and prepared perfectly. \n\nAs we moved onto dessert, the choices were hard because everything sounded extremely delectable. I got the Chocolate Sin Cake, which the espresso and chocolate mixed together was mouth-watering. My sister ordered the Strawberries and Cream. The strawberries tasted fresh and sweet. My parents split an amazingly tempting apple cobbler served warm with vanilla ice cream and overflowing with delicious apples	1
Needed the heel on my work shoe repaired. I walked in and they fixed it right there and then. Quick and sufficient! Definitely recommend this place to the locals.	1
I've been to Ullrich's twice and both times received excellent service.\n\n My first time at Ullrich's was to have the end caps of my heels replaced (for a second time). Initially I went to another repair store in Sq Hill and had them replaced -- but the replacement heels were totally wore out again within a couple months.  Went to Ullrich's to have them redone and after 6 months of hard walking, the heels are still wearing great.  \n\nI won't go any where else.	1
This place is horrible. The cobblers do not know what they're doing. You can get better service elsewhere for cheaper.\n\nI came to this place to get my dress shoes tapped and have rubber protection pads applied on the front half. There are logos on the bottom of the shoes and I told the cobbler to not cover the logos. The cobbler kept saying that he knew exactly what he was doing. In the end, I found out that he ground down half of the logo on one of the shoes and covered it with the rubber protection. Also, he smeared the black glue (used to apply the rubber protection pads) all over the bottom of my shoes.	0
I brought my boots here to get fixed. They did a good job however the lady was extremely rude when I came to pick them up. I won't be going here again.	0
People always look at me like I'm nuts when I tell them that I get shoes repaired.  I guess the norm is to just throw a pair of shoes away if a heel wears down or a zipper breaks.  But I get attached to shoes, so a good shoe repair place is a must-find for me in a new city.\n\nUllrich's is awesome.  The owner (I think his name is Rex or Max? Something with three letters, anyway) is very friendly and will chat with you all day if you have the time.  They are reasonably priced (about $10 for a new zipper, less for a heel replacement).  Usually an order will take about a week for them to get to, but if you need it right away and you ask nicely, they can fix something while you wait.  I've had three pairs of boots repaired here now, and have been very pleased every time.  Highly recommended.	1
"Best deal for shoe repair! I've been trying to get my boots resoled but didn't have it in me to pay $50+ bucks that they charge everywhere else. I stumbled in here and they happily fixed up in a day for a mere $12.\n\nI mean this was after their painfully awkward attempt at small talk ...\""so you have family in Japan?\"" and \""you go to the gym a lot?\""... but I'll bear that much for a $12 fix up"	1
Really good quality old school Italian in the downtown business district. \n\nGreat service, good selection and some great specials.	1
Food was okay, but was very surprised that they have absolutely no handicapped accessibility. Steps to get in from the street, restrooms up the stairs to 2nd floor. No accessible stalls in restrooms. Surprising in this day.  NOT HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBLE.	0
I'm not quite sure what happened to Papa J's in the past year....\nI remember always being delighted with my lunches in the past.  When a coworker suggested this last week, I was really excited to go back.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, everyone noticed all the dead fruit flies on the table. Yuck.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  He did mess up one order though, but she decided just to eat what they mistakenly gave her.  \n\nI had the Chicken Piccata.  I just love this dish.  My boyfriend's version is pretty top notch, so Papa J's had some high standards to live up to.  It was just meh.  The chicken wasn't very well seasoned and the sauce was overpowered by lemon.  All I could taste was citrus.  \n\nI also had a few bites of the Chicken Marsala.  Not sure the ingredients they used in this sauce, but holy crap was it sweet.  Really glad I didn't order that dish, I wouldn't have been able to eat it!\n\nI was really disappointed with this visit.  We probably won't be back any time soon.	0
We wanted to check out the gay scene in Pittsburgh and since we were staying downtown this seemed like a great place. Positives: doorman was nice and they played good music. \n\nNegatives: the lighting, the decor and the smoking. The smoking was really disgusting actually as the smell lingered in our hair and our clothes after we left; I think they should consider opening up a little smoking area, just a thought. As for drinks, we ordered lemon drop martinis and I know, this is so far from being a martini bar, but the bartender did a pretty great job.\n\nGlad we went, but we won't go back.	0
I've got a golden ticket.  I've got a golden twinkle in my eye.  \n\nWhile sadly I didn't get a golden ticket that didn't stop me from breaking into a ear to ear grin while simultaneously humming songs from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when I walked into Mon Aimee.\n\nIf you consider yourself a chocofiend you must go and gaze upon the rows of artisan and savory chocolates on sale.  If that wasn't enough they also have got an amazing gelato to tempt you with.\n\nYour tastebuds will love you for it.	1
Awesome things about Mon Aimee:\n\na. Kind, knowledgeable, attentive staff.\n\nb. Excellent variety of chocolates from throughout the US as well as tons of international options. (two favorites: Poco Dolce from San Francisco and Eclipse from San Diego)\n\nc. New products appear frequently (exciting for a regular visitor)\n\nd. As other reviewers have enthusiastically mentioned, CAPOGIRO GELATO, dark chocolate flavor. Seriously, the best I've found in the US (...and by that I mean darkest chocolate. It's always too light elsewhere!). We're really lucky they distribute it in Pittsburgh. \n\nMy only caveat would be that for items you can find in the grocery store, such as Chocolove bars, you're better off grabbing them at Whole Foods, Giant Eagle, or Right by Nature - you may save about a buck per bar.	1
For a place called Mon Amiee, this is the un-friendliest place I've ever shopped.  The elderly couple who oversee the premises make you feel as if you're about to commit a chocolate faux pas at any moment.  Come on, a smile would help.  \n\nThe selection here is stellar, but the prices are ridiculously high.  You can get the same stuff at World Market for $2 less a bar.  Even Whole Foods is less expensive.  \n\nNice gellato.  Good Chocolates. Expensive.  Grim staff.	0
Talk about sucking the fun out of what, by nature, should be nothing but rainbows and sunshine and unicorns.\n\nThe staffer working here on our visit was so sour and unwelcoming that husband and I turned right around and walked out.  Too bad, too, because the place looked adorable and was packed wall-to-wall with unique confections of the chocolate persuasion.\n\nEven the pedagogical Oompa Loompas loosened up and danced every now and again.	0
This was the first gourmet chocolate shop I went into and I spent a lot of time here debating what to buy - considering the chocolate melting during the bus ride, what I actually want to eat, etc. It was difficult choosing and I finally ended up with mik chocolate covered pretzels, a hazelnut chocolate bar and one milk chocolate and one dark chocolate Guittard bar. I really wish I bought more, but everything in the store was on the pricier side and I really didn't see anything else I liked. This is definitely a good place to visit when in Pittsburgh.	1
I'm not sure where the complaints about the staff are coming from? My mom, sister and I went in there this past weekend and found the staff to be quite informative and friendly.  \n\nThis is a killer chocolate emporium.  Looking for that British chocolate from your semester abroad? Here is the place to go.  Needing a faux deviled egg for a chocolate themed picnic, have them in stock.  Looking for some of the more unique flavors in smaller sizes, check.\n\nPrices are high: some bars probably can be found at lower prices elsewhere but the range isn't available.\n\nI'm knocking one star off because the paths in the store are narrow making it hard for people with mobility issues to manuver.  Completely worth the stop if you are in the area.	1
great selection, nice store. Prices are high . I wish there was a courtesy card given for frequent big spenders. \n\nTHey pack t hings up well in summer m onths with ice if needed.\n\nI really wish they had samples because I dont want to buy a $15 bar if I wont like it......\n\n2 times i went there and they had NO hot chocolate...\n\nTOday, Jan 7th I am calling them but no answer to their phones to see if they are open\n\nThe service is most often rude. Owners just are not welcoming	0
"The gelato counter was disappointing.  The woman who served us told us that it was \""rated in the top 5\"" gelatos in the country and added that it was \""from Philadelphia.\""  Isn't that the same as \""not made fresh in Pittsburgh?\""  \nWhen we asked if we could mix flavors, she said that we couldn't do that because \""it's too messy.\""  What she should have said was that the portion would be too small to able to mix.  She oh so carefully dipped less than a full scoop and dropped it in the cup.  The gelato wasn't good enough to be short scooped, even in a fancy chocolate shop in the Strip district.  Maybe they figure that the tourists who stop there won't be coming back anyway.  \nIf you find yourself at Mon Aimee Chocolat and want gelato, leave immediately and go to Mercurio's on Walnut St. in Shadyside.   There you'll find better gelato, more flavors, which you can mix, and you'll be served with a smile."	0
I can only review the nonpareils and truffle sampler.   The nonpareils are very low quality dark chocolate and for 14.00 per pound definitely not worth it.   The truffles had two salted, one of which was milk chocolate.  They were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through.  I have to assume that the chocolate with  name brand wrappers are better than the ones they make in house.	0
"There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap, and I don't understand how they can use the term \""egg\"" in the name.  There's no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken!   Absolutely horrible."	0
I love going to the Strip and supporting the businesses in the neighborhood but you couldn't give me the produce from this place! Yes, it is cheaper but it's sort of like you get what you pay for here. \n\nThis summer I really noticed the items they put out on the street had mold right on it and very noticeable. One item in particular was their strawberries. I would think if your whole operation is selling produce you would take more pride in it. I tend to hit the farmer's market or Right By Nature. Yeah it's extra but I'd rather get better, quality food.	0
Stan's has great prices OUTSIDE mostly because they things they have prepacked are spoiled and moldy or will be tomorrow.  Inside is just average quality, equally average priced produce.	0
Cheap, everyone seems to say that.  And it's true.  But I wasn't feeling it here.\n\nI for one did not want to dig through the dirty to find the golden product.  I know it's in the strip, but I didn't appreciate the amount of bugs flying around me as I was browsing the produce.  \n\nThis will probably be a place I just walk by the next time I'm in the strip.  I did not enjoy it here at all.	0
The price and freshness of the produce here is on par with most of the other vendors in the strip district. I'd recommend stopping by here to see which groceries are being discounted; those tend to be a good bargain.	1
I stopped in at Klavon's last weekend for the first time. I stopped in around 8pm, and even though it seemed like the neighborhood was deserted, Klavon's was packed! Very popular spot!  \n\nIf you are on the Strip in PGH, you have to check this place out. Taking a step into Klavon's is like taking a step back in time. This place was originally an old drugstore/ soda fountain from the 1920's. The inside is all original complete with 3 old telephone booths, stained glass windows, beautiful counter top, fancy chrome soda fountains, and several glass display cases displaying items from times past! Stop in here for a quick lunch and a shake or an ice cream cone.. or share a $20 Super Bowl Sundae with friends.. if you dare! ;)	1
Lots of history at this place.  Once a drug store, now an ice cream parlor.  Be sure to read the interesting story of this place, and check out the flood line when you visit.  You can also sign their guest book while you're there.\n\nThe guys working here were extremely nice.  They were very patient while I perused their extensive menu.  They offer all sorts of ice cream creations such as floats, sundaes, splits, and milkshakes.  They even offer no sugar added and lactose-free options as well as flavored whipped cream.  In the end I decided on a single scoop of ice cream in a cone - how boring.	1
Awesome place to go on a date. Cheap and super cute.	1
This place is totally a trip, but so charming. Has anyone ever seen the movie 'Nothing But Trouble'? If so, this place was straight out of Valkenvania. Luckily, the ice cream was superb. I got the black cherry frozen yogurt and after one tongue swipe of my cone, I'd forgotten that I'd chosen frozen yogurt as opposed to ice cream. Can't wait to go back...even if it is totally freaky time warp.	1
"\""Could have bought it in a store\"" Hershey ice cream that had the crystal-y signs of freezer burn.  Totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out.  No one gave us a bill and I had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money.  Didn't even get a \""thanks\"" with my change.\n\nSo not worth the walk that we took to get here."	0
Klavon's is a wonderful slice of history.  It's a beautifully preserved old time pharmacy and soda fountain.  Ray Klavon is the owner and the grandson of the original owner, and this soda fountain is an absolute labor of love.\n\nThere are selections on the menu that you can't find anyplace else...Depression Era Phosphates and also Egg Cremes.  My favorite ice cream dish is the Ballerina...which looks absolutely fabulous and tastes great.\n\nI love the old phone booth, the marble counters, and the other small details that indicate this place is the genuine article.\n\nI keep going back again and again, and I am always warmly greeted by the staff.  This is an especially nice place to visit by bike.	1
Awesome	1
Just got back from a trip to the Burgh and of course Klavon's!!!\nStill AWESOME!!!	1
Stepping into Klavon's does give me a feeling of stepping back in time. \n\n1920's?! That's almost over 100 years ago. Maybe that's the good old days where you can find soda fountain together with medications?? \n\nThe staffs here are just like grandmothers too... Sweet smiling ladies taking our orders while my friend just could not decide what she wanted? Ice Cream Float? Ice Cream Sundae? or that Super Bowl Sundae ($25) that comes with 8 scoops of ice cream plus all the fixings!\n\nHere at Klavon's the ice cream selections are more traditional too. You find your good old, Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, Peanut Butter Fudge.. 15 different ones to choose from. And make sure to request their special flavoured whipped cream!\n\nMy scoop of Toasted Almond Fudge ($2.80) so nutty and smooth. \n\nKlavon's Twenty-Eight Ice Cream Parlor is definitely neat place for a little time out if you are in the area! The experience will put a smile on your face!	1
One step into this place and all of a sudden, its like you've stepped into the 1950s.  Super old school, but quite cool.  The ice cream selection is not very extensive, but it sure does taste great.  Excellent service.  Just an old school kind of place that you'll have to check out.  I recommend the peanut ball ice cream.	1
"Hands down, this is the best ice cream parlor in Pittsburgh. The ice cream is rich and creamy-- it has a distinct texture from other ice creams places... and it's miles away from store bought ice cream.... yuck. Even the presentation of your dessert is outstanding! \n\nThe decor is dated. It stands a fine line between the \""vintage\"" feel and just plain old. And it was in a sketchy area. I walked over from Chinatown, and there were no other businesses (or people) around. It's a diamond in the rough type place."	1
"What a great place to stop on a beautiful Pittsburgh evening.  Our group of seven were greeted by two helpful and knowledgeable young ladies, Jessica and Courtney to explain all the yummy offerings.  They serve Penn State Creamery ice cream which is rich and creamy.  They offer custom made flavored whipped creams (chocolate, vanilla, pumpkin pie) To top their decadent sundaes and treats.\n\nThey also offer a variety of \""penny\"" candies and fudge.\n\nWhenever we need a sugar rush we will be returning to Klavon's!!"	1
I can't believe I never knew about this place! It was a pharmacy back in the 1920's and now is a soda and ice cream place. The soda counter and everything is original, it's almost like stepping back in time!!! There are even the old phone booths ,and ask about the water line from when it was flooded long long ago! The hubby had a peppermint soda with a scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream that was really good, and we had a panini and chili that were also tasty. I hope to go back for more food soon!	1
This place gets a 4 star based on the decor itself. There is nothing like a classic ice cream parlor setting to take you back and provide its own unique experience. The ice cream is nothing special but its the booths and the menus and the pretty decor that really got me.	1
Just found this gem.  This is a great place for every ice cream lover.  Great place to hang out with friends or to go on a date.\n\nI recommend the sundaes at this place.  This is pure 50's and 60's style that isn't forced.  Staff are very friendly and patient.	1
My 93 year old grandma is an ice cream maven and Klavon's is her definition of heaven.  Our whole family loves going here.  I would give them six stars if I could.  But before my review, a word of warning - their hours on their website are completely inaccurate and not updated so don't go by the website alone.  As of writing this review, their hours are Noon - 8pm daily, I believe.\n\nKudos to the new owners of Klavon's.  The original family sold it about a year ago and the new owners are following right in their footsteps.  The people who work there are still so dang nice.  The place is so down to earth.  The original 1920s decor is still perfectly intact.  (Thanks for not going over the top and making this place cheesey old-timey.)\n\nVibe aside, their food is great.  They now use Penn State Creamery ice cream.  They have a decent sandwich selection.  The prices are really good.	1
I had heard about Klavon's for some time, but never found myself in that area of the Strip.  The day I did, I did not hesitate to enter and taste the ice cream that had such excellent reviews. Firstly I discovered that there was new management. They definitely did not appear happy to see me enter. I was met with hostile stares. I approached and told them I had heard many good things about this store and its wares. No breaking of the ice. I ordered and was given a scoop of ice cream the size of a golf ball for four dollars.  Save your money and time.	0
Super Sundae.	1
This hotel is in a great location right next to the convention center and  is walkable to PNC Park, Heinz Field, downtown bars, etc. \n\nRooms are clean with high ceilings and comfortable beds and pillows. The TVs are vintage mid 90s but who watches that much TV in a hotel room? \n\nThe only negatives are the lack of free breakfast (though they offer coffee in the lobby) and the $22 rate per day for valet parking. Save your money and park at the city garage right down the street which is about $5 or so per day. \n\nThey have a business center you can use to check your email, use the internet, price boarding passes, etc. free right by the front desk. All the staff was friendly too. \n\nI would stay here again in Pittsburgh if I can get a good rate.	1
I'd give it ZERO stars if i could. Worst customer service! My husband made an innocent mistake and confused the weekends for our trip back to his home town. We asked that we get the credit and offered to add a night to our stay. The hotel would be out NO money. But these corporate suits refused. So - they've lost a customer - a PLATINUM customer. We've given Marriott so much bloody money over the years, but these greedy suits could care less. A little goodwill would have cost them nothing. Where has good customer service gone????? Truly pathetic. And believe me - theres nothing special abt this hotel. The William Penn, the Doubletree, and several other hotels are FAR FAR FAR superior. Get good rates on Priceline. Heck - i'll even give a shout out to the Renaissance downtown -- it's not owned by the Courtyard jerks. Good luck! Go Steelers!	0
When I checked in, the front desk staff was missing.  When I checked out, the front desk staff was missing.  The valets had to be chased down every single time I needed to park or retrieve the car.  When I called a week later regarding the charges on my account, the first call was disconnected.  On the second call, I was put on hold for ten minutes before I gave up.  On the THIRD call, I asked the clerk to email me a copy of a form, and she informed me that the scanner was down and she would be unable to for several days.\n\nThe pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator.\n\nDoes ANYBODY run the show here??  What a disgrace to the Marriott name.	0
Literally worst service i've ever received at a hotel. Was using a conference room for multiple days and had to beg snooty staff to come refill waters and clean the room. Also, policies like how much parking costs seem to change from visit to visit. \n\nTo sum up, i cringe thinking i'll ever have to speak to the people at the front desk again. The location is amazing, they have that going for them. \n\nDo not stay here. You will be disappointed.	0
This hotel is well located. However the staff, especially Zac don't care a bit if you have elite status or not. The staff is young. The manager nowhere to be seen. No upgrades. Room has high ceiling. So what. Not personal at all strictly business. Restaurant no great shakes. One of three. The better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner. Bellhop seen limited times. To get a cab walk to the Westin across the street. Or take a bus. No hello on entering. Not friendly. So why stay here? Not a 4 star. Really a 3 star. Point redemption way too high. Nothing to recommend. Stay at the Westin across the street and kiss the staff there goodbye. Run. Don't walk away.  Not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful. \nLinda b august 2013 will never stay again!	0
Do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 AM. They could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street. If loudness doesn't bother you than this place is fine.	0
This courtyard has had the renovation treatment that most are getting around the country. Not every room has a mini fridge yet but they can bring you one if you request. I had a room looking into the courtyard which is nice for sound but weird for having the blinds closed for privacy.	1
Great deli.  Had a very good Ruben today.  Great food and friendly service.   I'll definitely be eating here again.	1
"More \""delis\"" should take a lesson in how to be good from this place.  My office is about 2 blocks away from the SSD and has been for about 5 years.  That means I've eaten here quite a few times.  And honestly, I've never been disappointed.  Actually, not living in Pittsburgh anymore, I've yet to find an authentic deli that's this all-around good here in Denver.  But don't worry, I'll keep trying.\n\nTheir sandwiches are huge and delicious - high quality (and quantity) meats and cheese.  The breads are delicious.  The soups are delicious - the stuffed pepper is to die for.  I used to find myself stalking the menu for stuffed pepper soup day.  Their chili is good.  Their salads are good.  Lots of folks in my office stalk the menu for taco salad day as well.  Do you see a theme here?   \n\nIt gets insanely busy at lunch, and there's not much space inside to move around and wait for your order, but it's a small price to pay for deli food that's this good.  You should eat here!"	1
It's just plain good!  Whether you like a hot pastrami on rye or a plain ol' turkey sandwich this deli is the real deal!  Large portion sizes, free refills on soda, and the friendliest staff around.  Daily specials are a bargain and my own personal recommendation...the Reuben and the turkey Rachel are out of this world!	1
Pastrami sandwich(hot) was great. Tender and plenty of flavor. The only thing I didn't care for was the $14.50 for the sandwich, can of soda, and bag of chips.	1
I religiously order the same thing at both locations and it is excellent each time: the turkey rachael on sourdough instead of rye. The matzo ball soup, while not like mom's, is still very tasty. Fellow diners I have eaten with have ordered the corned beef, the roast beef, and the pastrami and have raved about them all. I highly recommend this authentic deli.	1
You'll love this deli! The sandwiches are enormous and full of delicious meats. They're known for their fish, but we didn't have that. The kids had big grilled cheese sandwiches. You MUST get the horseradish cheddar spread - you'll breathe better for days!! Their hours are kinda funky, so check before you head over.	1
Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  \n\nI literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. \n\nWhen I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. \n\nThe attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. \n\nAs some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this subway.	0
I came here last weekend to see Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre perform The Great Gatsby. The show was wonderful with amazing cherography by John McFall and Lauri Stallings of Atlanta Ballet. What amazed me just as much was the beatuiful theatre the performance was shown in.\n\nBuilt in 1927, the Benedum Center is awe-inspiring and magical.  After following strict guidelines, the theatre was restored to its original grandeur in the 1980s. It is one of the most beautiful theatres I have been in. with over 90 chandeliers, and original mirrors and marble in the Grand Lobby.\n\nMy only word of caution, the seats in the upper balconies are extremely tight giving taller people very little leg room.	1
"a great time!\n\nPROS:  \nPLENTY of seating\nan insane variety of shows!\njust a really pretty historic building\n\nCONS:\nParking is poo (bc there isn't any; you've gotta find a spot--I like the garage across from the Renaissance Hotel and then walk a bit)\nA bit old    (but that's really part of the charm for me)\n\nI've seen a lot of stuff here as a kid, but as an adult I've seen \nThe Beauty & The Beast (Phenominal)  [a few years back]\nand David Grey (which was an awesome show!!)  [March 2010]\nPhantom of the Opera - Farewell Tour  [September 2010]\n\n\n\n*I checked \""Good for Kids\"" only because they do offer children-centered shows.\nSome shows are also appropriate for kids depending on YOUR kids   ;)\nIf you have little ankle-biting heathens, then please don't take 'em and ruin the show for everyone else   ;)"	1
THE place to catch touring Broadway shows	1
saw the austrailian pink floyd show 2 times and a doo wop show once. place was built when everyone was 5'5 150 lbs.\ni am 6'3 270 lbs ,so its a toyt squeese for a 2 hour concert. but the sound and just the atmosphere makes me forget my knees are loc ated behind my ears. red carpet on the walls makes me get all giddy. betcha a cat would go ape in a place like this. hope its open forever.	1
I recently attended La Traviata here.  Great show!  The Benedum is a fantastic facility for the arts and a true asset to the Pittsburgh region.  The only reason why it is not 5 stars, is they need to update the downstairs, and possibly the upstairs bathrooms.  They were a little outdated and lacked the elegance of the rest of the facility.  Nevertheless, a very fine theater.	1
I always love coming to the Benedum.  We attended Wicked on a recent Sunday night.  I am always astounded by the beauty of this theater.  \n\nHere are a couple interesting facts:  The mirrors, marble and woodwork in the Grand Lobby are all original.  There are over 90 crystal chandeliers, torchieres and sconces in the theater, all but one are original.  The original cost was $3 million back in 1928.  Compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million.  \n\nWe had perfect seats, Row AA.  How lucky is that?  Loved the performance.  My first time for Wicked.  But just as entertaining is the view of theater.  Love it here.  So beautiful and so ornate.  And while the seats are showing some signs of wear, the good news is the 2,881 seats will be repaired and refurbished to the tune of $450,000.\n\nYou know, it always feels really special here.  No matter what event we attend.  Looking forward to coming back during the holiday season.	1
Saw Phantom when it came through. Grew up seeing Nutcracker every year. JC Superstar was awesome. Beautiful place and Pittsburgh is soooo lucky to have it!	1
Great theater !!! Absolutely beautiful .. Live the seating ... Seen Book of Mormon here !!! Loved it	1
Mom forgot her cane in the coed restroom.  Mom went to see Evita.  She says the lead performer got a standing ovation.  Mom said the people attending the event looked decent but they weren't really dressed up.  It was such an older crowd that they came and left in Access SUVs and a school bus.  The opera noted that they started in Oakland in someone's living room and the opera has been in Pittsburgh for seventy-five years.  Mom said the venue was packed but the last three rows were empty and that's where she sat for her rush ticket.  Mom said this place was pleasant because of the calm crowd.  When I asked mom how multicultural the crowd was.  She said there were a few groups of Chinese people and a few African Anericans,	1
This is my first time here and definitely not my last.  An absolutely beautiful and historic theater with a pretty bad- chandelier, if I do say so.  If you want to experience the best of what this city has to offer, visit the Benedum.\n\nThe bf and I came to see Elf the Musical for our anniversary.  I was blown away by the beauty of the Benedum!  The ceilings!  The lighting!  The candied almonds... Ok so I bought those ... I smelled them them minute I walked in.  It's part of Buddy the Elf's food groups, so I'm allowed right?  Ok ok I'm not here to review the show, I'm supposed to review the Benedum.\n\nThe Benedum has all of the features a classic theater had to offer - cathedral ceilings with the gold leaf and naked babies, massive chandeliers, huge archways, and the feeling that history took place here.  So come and visit one of the many shows at the Benedum.  \n\nExcuse me while I enjoy my nuts.	1
I have seen several shows here over the years. Most recently, I saw wicked, which was amazing!!! The one thing I really have to applaud about the Benedum is that the seats are all pretty good. I am on the shorter side and have never had trouble seeing, no matter where I was seated.	1
A beautiful theater, no doubt.  It's absolutely stunning.\n\nSeating however?  ARghhh... Can only vouch for the first balcony tier.  These have got to be, by far, the most cramped seats I've ever encountered, Boston, MA and NYC included.  I get that they will be somewhat confining; but, seriously, I'm 5'5 and my legs were crushed against the seat in front of me.  The thought of crossing my legs at any point was merely a thought; it wasn't gonna happen -- no way.  \n\nSo, while renovating it never occurred to anyone to arrange seating with a wee bit of space?  I mean even airlines have more space (yeah, yeah, by only mere inches, but it counts).  \n\nOne plus was the ladies restrooms.  There are enough to accommodate and the line went surprisingly fast.  \n\nFour stars for the beauty; definitely not for the seats.	1
I love the Benedum. Really there's not a bad theater in Pittsburgh, but this just has my heart. Recently just saw the Nutcracker, but have seen many a show here. \nPlenty of parking garages in the vicinity so not a far walk once parked downtown. Great restaurants nearby. \nPricing is good, too. I love that they offer discounts to teachers. Yay! They also do student rush tickets, too I believe. \nTrust Arts gets a great selection of shows to come to Pittsburgh so you can see a great Broadway series production in your hometown or if you visit Pittsburgh. And, in that case this is something to do on your visit. \nI sat most recently in the orchestra seat which are nice. I prefer the director's circle above so you don't have to dodge a head in front of you.  I did once sit in 4th row orchestra and well, that's pretty damn awesome! \nI will always be back to this theater.	1
When you come to this place it really looks like a dump but once you enter you get a really good service depending on how busy they are.  I haven't seen a place better in pittsburgh but they scrub your exterior with brushes to get the hard to get off bugs and dirt.  The car wash is automated as well and hand dried.  I got the platinum service which cleans the inside as well and they did a great job.  There were a few things that they missed but when I told them about it they took care of it.  When cleaning the car they even cleaned the door hinges area meticulously.  I was very happy that Pittsburgh has a decent hand car wash place and good detailing.  There is always room for improvement but these guys did a great job.  I would definitely go back again.  Keep looking at their website for specials they have 3x  $16 dollar car washes for $24 sometimes.  Great deal.	1
A good bar with OK food.  \n\nFairly diverse menu, so you dont have to have a burger, etc.	1
I have only one thing to say... Garbage Burger. Max and Erma fans know exactly what I'm talking about. When in the burgh go to Max and Erma's for a garbage burger!	1
Incredibly slow, worst club I've ever had...hilite was the tortilla soup. That was actually edible. Waiting 40 minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable. Especially when we were the 2nd table seated of the day.	0
Stopped In before a show at Heinz Hall.  It was not crowded, but the waiter was almost useless.  He did not know the beer list, drinks went unfilled, etc.  Plus I was served teriyaki fajitas.  That's right, these were the oddest fajitas I have ever been served.  The taste was OK, but it is not what I expect fajitas to be.  That said, my wife's Reuben and son's fish and chips were OK.  Overall it was just OK food served by an incompetent waiter.	0
I treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner , to recognize their high PSSA scores and over all academic success so far this school year.  What can I say the kids just love this place.\n\nFor me the food was terrible.  I wouldn't even have cooked this way for an enemy. I got the cabo shrimp salad. This was four tiny dried up shrimp served in a bowl with ice berg lettuce an rotten tomatoes.  \n\nThe kiddies had Beatlejuices which is grape juice and Sprit with a gummy worms. They also had Oreo milk shakes which they demolished and said were super yummy. \nEach of them for dinner also had a cheese burger. The burger was juicy and delicious. \n\nI have to comment on th bathrooms. They are in terrible shape. The toilet paper rolls are broken so instead of fixing the toilet paper rolls Max and Erma's just sit the roll of toilet paper on top of the broken toilet roll. I couldn't believe it!	0
I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet, stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had.  Well, this place manages to be worse than it.\n\nThe place is rather run down.  The buffet was really terrible.  Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source.  It just wasn't a great environment.  Try something else, definitely!	0
The food at this place is at best mediocre, but it deserves something better than 1 star given the good service. Every other place in the neighborhood was either packed or seemed like it would have slow service so we decided to come in here despite it looking like it was closed with no one inside. We were served very quickly, as promised, and it's not the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I know, that's not saying a lot, but given the limited options in the area, it may be worth knowing about this place as a possible alternative.	0
"1.5 stars.  I agree with Eszter, this deserves 2 stars only because of the service.  A sad little \""Chinese\"" buffet with a smattering of overcooked options.  Soups were borderline offensive.  There probably won't be a wait!"	0
I can't tell you how bad this place is, regretted not looking up on yelp for reviews before ordering for delivery.\n\nSeriously this place has the worst Chinese food I've had in my whole life!!!!!!!!!!	0
I think I'm spoiled when it comes to Chinese buffet because I live in an area with fantastic buffets. Liang's buffet is not great. It fills your stomach but that's about it. Their buffet has a smaall selection of so-so Chinese food. On the plus side, service is good and there are times late at night when this restaurant is the only one along this block still open. That's worth keeping in mind if a convention is keeping you busy until late at night.	0
Bad!!! Worst Chinese food in Pittsburgh!	0
This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business.	0
Dined in. Food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet. Lo Mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it.  Broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked. Finally I ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef. First time I ever wondered if I was being served cat.	0
Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses? My advice to you son, is do the same as your father, and his father did...get a job!!!	0
I love this store! \n\nAre you looking for -\n\na selection of stuffed rats?\n\nsunglasses shaped like martini glasses or dollar signs or hearts?\n\ncheap Pittsburgh mugs or magnets?\n\nIC Light or Steelers merchandise?\n\nold fashioned candy?\n\nparty hats?\n\nOk, you get the idea. This store is STUFFED full of all kinds of things that you will suddenly absolutely need and it's reasonably priced. It's also the perfect place to buy some junk to take home to your friends :)	1
This is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip. A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernalia.	1
An e-mail conversation with a fellow Yelper yesterday reminded me of how much I love stinky food.  So I had to satisfy my craving for such today with a nice kielbasa (or is that kolbassi) from Wiener World.  M-M-M-M load that baby up with onions!   Dee-lishous!  Now will someone please pass me the Listerine?\n\nI also promise I'll hit the treadmill and the elliptical trainer tonight!	1
What's this, a fifth review of a hotdog stand?  Read on o' Downtown diners!\n\nIt figures.  The other day I was telling my Yelp friend Mike O. about my sudden lunchtime craving for encased meats.  I figured hey, it being a nice day why not get a dog with all the goodies on it and dine al fresco?  It's mid-October--how many more outdoor dining days are we gonna have?  So I got me a regular dog loaded up with all the goodies, fries, and a drink.  Mmmm-mmm good, right?	1
"They charge $4 for a hot dog that is not any different from one you can get at any 7/11 for $1.  Not sure how to review it other than to say have you ever gone into any gas station convenience store in America and gotten a \""big dog\"" or whatever, and put condiments on it?  It's the same thing but 3 more dollars.  They did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive.\n\nI hate supporting chains but independent places are supposed to offer something more unique than a neato neon sign.  You might pay as much for a dog in Chicago or New York but they're something special.  For less the amount I could have gotten a corn beef sandwich at various places nearby.  Liked the people and the atmosphere.  Next time I'll try the ice cream."	0
Every time I come here, hoping, just hoping that I'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs. Raw. Unfiltered. Old school. Like a ballpark from the 1920's or something.\n\nBut each time I come away disappointed, even more than last time.\n\nMy father worked here three or four decades ago. I'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friends.\n\nThe service is anywhere from good to great, and they are fast and friendly!\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long. At odd hours. or an hour after the rush.\n\nEvery time, the hotdogs (and brats) are harder than a rock.  Not a snappy casing, no, this is like barely edible hard exterior.\n\nSo what's a man to do? Try again?  Sadly, I'll probably forget about my recent experiences, and try them again.\n\nI just hope they are fresher next time, because I can't imagine them worse than today.	0
I love a good hot dog and this is a good hot dog place.  The people working were incredibly nice and helpful people.  The inside as others have said just has a standing bar against a wall and that's it.  The hot dogs were full and plump and had good flavor.  They have plenty of options for toppings on the dogs.  I also got fries and a malt.  The malt was very good and the fries were just your standard average fries.  All in all if you like hot dogs you should try this hot dog joint.	1
I like a dive restaurant as much as the next person, but this is not my kind of place.  It smelled dirty, the bartender and the lady who took our orders were both very unpleasant, and the food didn't taste fresh.  It just doesn't look clean in there, so that is a major concern.  You can be a bit hole-in-the-wallish, but you still need to keep the place clean.  Our table smelled like a moldy washcloth had been used to wipe it.  Won't be eating there again.	0
I don't understand why this place think's it has famous Corned Beef. I can only believe it's because there are no other deli's downtown.  The restaurant/bar is a dive.  The Corned Beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special.  Not worth the trip.	0
I walked into Sammy's expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get. I don't think Sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich. Meat was dry under seasoned and Luke warm. The bread was just sliced supermarket bread. I hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place. Don't waste your time	0
Fish fry what what!  I must have literally walked past our Daily Bread Cafeteria 3000 times always seeing the open doors, always reading the daily specials but never stopping but today I  put my bustling on hold to get in on the Lenten specials. \n\nFor a mere $6.15 I got a filling home cooked or rather church cooked lunch. My lunch included fried cod mac and cheese and stewed tomatoes with a roll and butter.  I detected salt free cooking but the fish really popped once I added house made cocktail sauce. The stewed tomatoes were great and were prepared with garlic and green peppers. \n\nFor my first fish fry it was a great experience.	1
"If you plan on getting married here please ask them what their rules are regarding wedding photography and videography before you book.  They have very strict rules here and your hired professionals will have severe limitations on where they can be and what they can do.\n\nUnfortunately I see this kind of thing all too often and the church's reason being that they want to \""preserve the sanctity of the ceremony and the religion.\""  Meanwhile guests are taking video and photos with their smart devices.  If churches, like this one, wanted to preserve the sanctity of the ceremony than their rules should apply to all, not just the people hired by the couple to be there."	0
Rules made by men. Check them before you book this church to get married or any other event. Their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side. Stay away from this church.	0
It took over two hours for our lunch here and it wasn't even busy.  When the food finally came it was bad.  We never received an apology.  The prices are cheap, but it's not worth it.	0
The food was terrible! I got the crab cakes and they were mostly bread crumbs. Two people at our table got the crab bisque and neither could take more than 2 spoonfuls. It was a Wednesday at 7:30 and the restaurant was completely empty besides our group. We quickly found out why. I would NOT recommend this place for food.	0
This is a very small Irish pub.  The set up is relatively nice, despite its small size.  However, the location had a poor beer selection when we visited and appeared to be out of at least 3 of their draft selections. For well drinks, my girlfriend typically drinks vodka and cranberry and noted that their pour was very weak on vodka.	0
Mahoney's is the type of place where women are accosted by the bartender as my girlfriend was this evening. Don't go!	0
I am not digging the set up here the bar stools have arm rests which are fine  if the chair swiveled which it didn't and it was very awkward for me to get down with out the person next to be having to get up.\n\nThe bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable. There  is apparently a small collection of dictionaries and thesauri that are keep  above the register that are in serious need of a dusty.\n\nI won't  be back soon.	0
We went on a random Thursday night for dinner.  Our expectations were thinking this local establishment might be a great local pub with sub par food.  This is what we found. \n\nOur server was friendly enough and welcoming, but dining room area is out dated decor.  Food was not awful, but just barely average.  I had a salad and my husband had a fish sandwich.  They arrived quickly, were reasonably priced and by friendly staff, but the food was nothing special.  Nothing unique or notable about either one. \n\nThe bar area up front seems like a small, local friendly place to go after work, but I would skip the food.	0
To die for, especially for those who are crazy about coffee!! This place serves great coffee and also sells the widest array of whole-bean I have ever seen.  It is fun to sit and sip on a cup of coffee while they roast right in front of you.\n\nThe biggest selling point for me was the outstanding array of fair trade coffee they had to choose from!  Thank you, Fortunes!\n\nThis place is definately great to grab a good book and chill out for an afternoon on the Strip District!	1
Oh, heyyy-ayyy, buried bookmark.  Nice to see you again.\n\nFortunes served the best coffee we tried in Pittsburgh and had the most engaging and upbeat baristas.  Best part is the old-fashioned coffee roaster and barrels full of beans.  Lift, sniff, pack a bag for home.  I truly appreciate a self-contained coffeehouse doing everything on site.  And Fortunes is a completely unassuming and modest one.  Even better.	1
no. no. no.  $5 credit card minimum.  no bathrooms . . . and you sell coffee? good brew but why bother having tables if you don't have a place for customers to go?	0
I go here to buy coffee and for the occasional espresso before work.  The coffee has always been high quality and inexpensive - most varieties are around $10/lb which is certainly cheaper than any other whole bean you can find, even in supermarkets.  (that 8 oclock crap is roughly $8 for a 12 ounce bag, meaning $12 a pound, for THAT).  I am a dark roast fan - big fan of Fortune's French Roast and Espresso Roast.  They have a variety of dark, light,. blends, flavored, and decaf.  The people there have been consistently nice even when I went in the first time and didn't know how to work the grinder because I'm a jagoff.  The way the cafe is set up reminds me of the cafes in Italy where you are meant to come in, throw some hot espresso down your throat, maybe sit a while if there are any chairs open, maybe chat a while before going about your day.  I have no complaints.	1
Good Coffee and Travel Advice!  What more can you ask?\n\nA buddy and I decided to explore the strip district one Saturday and found this gem of a coffee shop.    We ordered a couple a Cappuccino's.    The employees were very nice and provided some good insight on what to see and visit.\n\nThe Caps were good, the vibe was great and it is in the heart of the Strip District.   A strong recommend.	1
First I want to say I LOVE coffee & I don't even understand the people writing reviews on here that DON'T drink or like coffee!!!!  So please look at the reviews of actual coffee lovers!!   I LOVE the Fortunes Coffee's.  We don't live there but stumbled into this place while walking down the Strip District.  I bought their Pumpkin Spice coffee & brought it to my son's house there to brew.  It was AWESOME!  So I had to go back & buy plenty more of both reg & decaf.  Now everytime we go back to Pittsburgh we have to go there & stock up.  If you want good tasting coffee, get it there!  The people there are very nice & helpful also!  I am drinking a cup of their coffee right now here in Florida & about to order some on their website!  YUMMY!!	1
The Wood Street Galleries is a small gallery located in the heart of downtown above the T station.  It has a layout similar to the Mattress Factory, but smaller (only two floors... usually with two to four installations per floor) and it usually, but not always has installation art.  Sometimes the installations are really awe-inspiring (in my experience about 75% of the time); sometimes not so much.  Admission is always FREE!\n\nDetails: To get inside, you need to enter through the door at Sixth and Wood St. (pretty sure about this...).  From there, take the elevator (only one and kind of small) up to the 2nd or 3rd floor, where the actual galleries are.\n\nSome advice: Try not to go during one of the quarterly Gallery Crawls because there'll be a looong line for the elevator to get in.	1
I wish more people knew about Wood Street Galleries! It's right in the heart of downtown and admission is FREE. you get to see great art and/or displays. Bobby and I always find ourselves here to escape the hectic downtown scene. They are closed Monday and Tuesday I believe. I'm always amazed at the different types of displays they have. Another great thing is that the displays are up for 3 months at a time, so if you really like something, you have the opportunity to go check it out again! :)	1
The gallery is right above the Wood Street T/Bus Station and can easily be missed, well at least that was the case for me. Having gone through that station at least few times a day during my college days - I never once realize there was a gallery above the station.\n\nSince last year's gallery crawl - I've gone there few times including during this year's gallery crawl. Depending on your view towards art - this place can be pretty interesting with their showcase of some unconventional art piece. Most of the time - the entire floor consists of one major art piece.\n\nThis is definitely a stop for any art lovers.	1
"A disappointing Amtrak station.\n\nWhat's really sad is that passenger rail has degraded so far in this country, especially in one of the areas where rail was once king.  Anyone who walks outside of the Amtrak station will witness Pittsburgh's Penn Station, a proud and magnificent facility that outlines how important passenger rail once was, with a vast rotunda to shelter vehicular traffic, and a majestic waiting area.  Unfortunately, all that has been converted to ... condos.\n\nNow, there's just a dumpy little room with some rows of seating and an Amtrak desk.  Given that only two Amtrak lines serve the station, each once daily, that's probably more sensible, but it is a sad commentary on how \""progress\"" often isn't."	0
Not the friendliest customer service.  Prices okay.  Look for deals on their website.	1
I have taken the train from Pittsburgh to Huntingdon, PA a few times. I have always had the best experiences. The train is clean and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and attentive. I would recommend the Amtrak train to anyone needing to travel long distance through public transit. \n\np.s. The free wifi and coffee from the cafe car make the trip even more enjoyable!	1
This Amtrak station is in need of a face lift! It is very dingy and outdated looking, which is surprising because it is underneath one of the most prestigious address in downtown Pittsburgh! \nThe employees were friendly and helpful, which was nice, and our train came on time which is really the most important thing!	0
This is a review for the AMTRAK CAPITOL LIMITED train route between Pittsburgh and Chicago.\n\nRiders beware. This is  a nightmare and a completely unreliable mode of transportation. Norfolk Southern owns these tracks. Unbeknownst to the lay traveler there has been delays BOTH ways on this route for the past 2 to 3 months.  Freight cars get preference. 7 mile stretch in Indiana with only one track.  Delay was 6 hours going to Chicago and over 7 hours coming back. The staff are trying to do their job but seems like the situation is out of their control. Amtrak fails to let customers know realistic arrival time. Terrible experience, I give it a F.	0
This place was horrible. Did not, even for a moment, have a seat on the chairs while i waited to board the next train. The walls were dirty, nasty and dingy. It smelled awful inside. It was quite crowded. And I just did not like my surroundings.\n\nAnd dont let me get started on the restroom. after seeing the filth in here, i decided to walk down the street at 5am in the freezing cold to the greyhound station nearby to use their facilities.\n\nThere was absolutely no type of cafe or even little convenient store within this station to grab a bite to eat while you wait. I did find a vending machine to get coffee but even that was watered down. \n\nThis place needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the bottom up. I waited with my family down the street at a different station before we had to be back to board our train. \n\nI will be sure to not have this place in any of my future stops. Not a good way to sell the city...Horrible!\n\nThe only reason why i give this station 1 star is because the train itself was quite comfortable and clean.	0
"Unbelievably bad! If the roach crawling up the wall doesn't scare you away the terrible fried rice will. The egg rolls have only cabbage in them. The \""chicken\"" is dark, fatty, and inedible. Don't miss the 100 pound tub of MSG as you walk in. I paid for my food ate half my egg roll noticed the roach, food was then delivered, I took one look at it and threw it out, and left. You should skip this place for sure."	0
Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality.	0
If a place downtown isn't busy at lunch time then either you're much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals OR the place stinks.  Fu Lai is the later.  \nThe food was gross and I usually wouldn't say that about a place.  My General Tso's seemed to have been previously frozen and I think I got 100% gristle.  I don't shriek at the sight of MSG, but this place uses a bit much.  I got a whopping 2 pieces of wilted broccoli and 1 sliver of onion in my dish and the sauce ewww the sauce.  Not sure why I stepped into Fu Lai, probably because I wanted some cheap Chinese.  Never going back.	0
I tried to give this place a chance despite it's reviews. It's not worth it. They were very quick (food ordered and delivered in under 25 minutes). The only thing is, my lo mein noodles were way overcooked and didn't have one vegetable in them. The noodles were very bland and almost chewy. My boyfriend's general tso's was less than subpar. The egg roll's didn't even have shrimp in them. Next time, I'll listen to the reviews.	0
Worst Chinese I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered pork fried rice.	0
The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad, weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards. We ordered for pick up and they forgot our drinks and plastic ware. I will definitely never order from here again. Absolutely disgusting.	0
"A co-worker and I decided to go out to lunch together today.  As a contrast to the rather bland, rushed meal I ate yesterday at Subway, I suggested he and I try this place.  I'd read good things about it in the \""Post-Gazette\"" and the \""Tribune-Review\"".\n\nThe Rachel sandwich sounded mighty tempting, but since I was in the mood to sample, I tried the soup and 1/2 sandwich combo.  The soup was delicious and it sure didn't taste canned.  The 1/2 chicken sandwich on rye was very fresh too.  Good, inexpensive place to eat at.  They do catering too, so maybe I'll recommend them for the next office party."	1
Stopped by Mark's for a quick bite to eat last night.  Both outside and in the place looks like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill bar, so I wasn't expecting anything special.  Then I saw that they had Dogfish Head and East End beers on tap - nice, I figured they'd just have macros.  I ordered a 60 minute IPA and a double-decker corned beef/pastrami Reuben.  The sandwich was amazing - fresh bread, lots of good meat, house-made dressing and slaw, and a heap of thick, flavorful, house-made chips.  It was easily the best sandwich I've had in Pittsburgh; admittedly this isn't saying much, but this sandwich would hold its own anywhere.  And at only $7 for a huge meal it's a great value, too.  I'll definitely be visiting Mark's again soon.	1
I shop in the strip all the time.  I come to Stamoolis for a few things:  feta, stuffed grape leaves, and olives.  They have lots of Greek items, so if that's your thing, you should swing through.\n\nThey have something like 8+ different types of feta (French, Bulgerian, Greek, Greek Barrel, etc.) I didn't know there were that many different types until I came here.  The stuffed grape leaves are my bench mark for grape leaves.  Dilly, lemony, a bit sour, stuffed with rice...I love these things here.  I also get my olives for dirty martinis here...pick out your olives, get them weighed, and then fill up your container with brine and...voila! the best dirty martini brine you can find, for practically free.\n\nThey also have a relatively extensive cheese selection, albeit nothing as compared to Penn Mac.  It's definitely cheaper than Penn Mac though, so if you're looking for smaller quantities, or some more common cheeses, check here first.	1
I went to the Strip to buy cheese for a few recipes I was going to try.  Since this was my first time buying cheese in the strip, I was planning on making my purchase at the more popular place next door.  However, I ended up buying everything from Stamoolis instead.  I like quality, but I also like a good price and I got both at Stamoolis.  It was nice to be able to get what I needed for a cheaper price than some other places.  I also love the bulk items here inlcuding the organic whole wheat coucous.\n\nMy only problem, even though it was minor for me was the the staff did not seem overly friendly or helpful.	1
I stop here every time I am in the Strip.  Authentic Greek grocery.  Do not pass up their stuffed grape leaves or the freshly made Babaganous & hummus.  They have great cheeses and a variety of dried lentils and spices.  You will find something delicious here, I promise you that.	1
Some of what they have is good, stuffed grape leaves,hummus and baklava, but beware, some items have been on the shelf too long. We discovered when we got home that two expensive cheeses were spoiled (no bree is not slimy & stinky nor is mozzarella.) We wasted $12 on spoiled food. Buyer beware. We are from out of town and cant return them. :( staff seemed distant and got the impression they did not want to be bothered. Stoic and unsmiling older guy was behind the counter. Hum, I'll be over here... grouch.	0
"Do not use this dry cleaner. The staff/owner smokes in the store. There are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around. I had to \""air out\"" my clothes after I picked them up from Galardi's to try to get rid of the cigarette smell. YUK!"	0
They lost my clothes and charged me for stuff I never sent.\n\nClearly they do not know what they are doing and need to get their act together!!	0
DO NOT GO HERE! They staple your name to your clothes because they can't handle organizing your things. Even with that, they've lost my clothes before. And now I just got a $110 sweater back from being dry cleaned and the loop to hold the tassel on is ripping off. They are clearly incompetent. Not only that, the place smells like an ashtray when you walk in. How are your clothes even clean when they come from that? Awful.	0
Not only did they damage a sweater, they told me they would take care of it with my tailor and never did.  On top of that, they write in PERMANENT MARKER on your clothes! Unbelievable! Stay away from this place.  Take the time and take your clothes somewhere else.	0
I used Galardi's for ~ 4 months when I first moved to Pittsburgh. I've since changed cleaners. I think Galardi offers great service for pick up and deliver dry cleaning in the downtown area. The owner is actually a nice lady; but, after nearly having 3 shirts ruined I decided enough was enough. \n\nI think their delivery guy is a huge part of the problem, I actually like the owner, but I can't keep having my clothes messed up and not have anyone take responsibility for it. I wish I could tell people to go here but I can't do it in good conscience.	0
i need you in los angeles. boo hoo. wah. sob. \n\nappreciate this place, pittsburghers. it rocks!!!\n\nthe cheese is of amazing quality and freshness. What fucking variety.\n\nAnd there are a million other tasty things under this roof. \n\nyou can't find a place like this easily, trust me, i have tried!	1
Penn Mac deserves more than 5 stars!\n\nThis place is the best italian food store I've seen anywhere in the US.  The selection and quality of their cheeses, meats, olives, pastas, oils, sauces, etc is just incredible.  The prices are also really good - any other store with a big cheese selection will charge a ton more.\n\nI used to shop here at least once a week and since I've moved away from Pittsburgh, this is the store I miss the most.  I now live in Chicago and even here there is nothing like it.  I still frequently buy their stuff online through their website....Thank God for the internet.\n\nFavorite items include: Calabrese Olives, House Italian Olive Oil, Istara Cheese, Mortadella w/Pistaccio, Ciabatta Bread	1
I love your wonderful cheese, Penn Mac!  You have an amazing variety, all my favorites.	1
I enjoy Italian food a lot, I've worked as a cook in a tuscan restaurant, and I happen to be Italian; therefore, I love Penn Mac Co..  I cannot find everything I need to cook a quality meal at any other single store.  Whether I'm making sauce from stewed tomatoes, perciatelli with anchovy, or salt-cod; this store never lets me down.  And despite the enormous traffic, the place is always clean and well stocked.  Any pasta shape you can think of can be found here dried and most you can find anywhere else can be found here fresh.  The fresh cheeses look great as do the olives, though to be honest I haven't bought any yet.  Well worth a visit while shopping the strip.	1
Besides the fact that they have a phenomenal selection of meats & cheeses, they also have some of the most helpful, knowledgable staff around. I've come in on multiple occasions, not at all knowing what I wanted, but knowing I needed to make a cheese & meat platter for six. All I do is tell them that, & they start pulling cheeses & slicing off slivers for me to taste! They're just wonderful at Penn Mac.\n\nPS Try the English Gloucester cheese - it's a rich, orange, sorta cheddary cheese that's chock full of chives! Basically, the ideal cheese for potatoes.	1
The restrooms looked like after an bombardment, an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices. Highly questionable hygiene for a food store!Disgusting. I will not go back until they clean up the place. It's just filthy!!!	0
The Penn Mac is a landmark in Pittsburgh.  I am a comlplete fan, in particular of their cheese section, which in many ways is the world's best.  They beat out the competition because of their excellent prices, selection, and their quality.  I have checked the prices at Whole Foods and Market District, and often times you pay twice as much at those places for the same cheese.  Carol, a.k.a. Dearheart, is a wonderful help, especially if you are there on a day when it's not as over crowded.  Some other great things about the store...bulk spices (very reasonably priced), olive oil, dried fruit, deli meats, and more.  This store is my favorite place in Pittsburgh and you are missing out if you have not visited!	1
A Pittsburgh version of DeBruno Brothers in Philadelphia, Zabars in NYC.  On entry, you are immediately hit with food smells.  They have everything for your charcuterie and pasta needs.  Cheeses, cured meats, breads, home made pasta.  I wanted everything there.  Don't go hungry (or do ;)  Very reasonable prices.	1
Is absolutely my favorite place in Pittsburgh. The employees of Penn Mac are friendly, knowledgeable, and genuine. Its refreshing to see people enjoy where they work. The best selection of cheeses, deli meats, and spices Pittsburgh. In fact Penn Mac is so solid at these three things I am not sure who is a competitive second. Oh and they have a gigantic selection of pastas (including 15+ varieties of fresh cut pasta), sauces, and oils.	1
I love it here :)  I love all the employees and the owners also!  I miss Penn Mac now that I live in Hawaii but I will visit every time I am in Pittsburgh!	1
"The best.\n\nThe cheese counter is heaven on earth.  The workers are awesome - who doesn't want to be called \""dear heart\"" while tasting delicious cheeses?  They're super helpful with my weird requests to find the perfect cheeses for every occasion.  I always walk out with new varieties and grab tons of nuts and sauces and oils on my way to the register.\n\nWe also had our engagement pictures taken here (does that show my level of obsession?).  We called in advance and the managers were all very kind - they told us to stop by their office and say, \""Hello\"" even.  It was so much fun!  \n\nMy mom also carted several cheeses down to North Carolina to be served as appetizers for my wedding as well.  Seriously obsessed. \n\nI love Penn Mac."	1
This is Italian heaven.  It has everything the Italian Pittsburgher could want.  I've since moved away from Pittsburgh but recently was sent some Penn Mac merchandise and it was a dream!  They package everything so well and ship it quickly!  I couldn't have asked for a better and tastier gift.  The store is perfection, but you already know that from other reviewers :)	1
I saw Franco Harris at this place he was a class act great place to by real food from Italy	1
Nothing better then the strip district in Pittsburgh. It's every Italians dream. The PMC is the best has a little bit of everything. Fresh bread great pasta and Olive for days. I love it here and the smell is terrific :)	1
I love this place!  They have everything and bc I currently am working in the Strip Dist I love being able to walk in there and pick up stuff for dinner on my way home.\n\nI would never, ever come here on the weekend bc I love myself far too much for that.\n\nThis place is always packed.  I like the cheese area but I never know what to get and so I've never bought cheese here.  But they have fresh pasta you can buy in the front of the house, and they've got great specialty items.	1
Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something??? In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review. Every January I buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members. I won't be doing that anymore.	0
How did I not realize that the Harris is cash only?	1
I like little indie theaters like this.  (WARNING: If you want big comfy seats, digital projection, surround sound, and a bucket o' soda, head elsewhere!)  It's small, shows art/foreign/indie films, and you can get a ginger ale for $1.50.  My ticket was only $4 since I'm a grad student...you can't beat that, and there are some amazing movies that show here!  My husband complained the whole time that the seats were uncomfortable, but I was fine.\n\nI am glad that we have the Harris downtown, and I will most likely return.	1
"I saw 'Blackbird' starring Mo'Nique, Isaiah Washington and Julian Walker at the Harris Theatre.  With a recently renovated sound system, there WAS a huge interruption during the viewing of the film with what sounded like a BLOWN out speaker (happened 3 times) that sent chills (bad ones) through the body of the audience.  \n\nNot my first time at the theatre, the lobby is quite small, but provides the iconic popcorn smell (and freshly popped) upon entry.  A great spot with beautiful lighting to draw in the general public, I am sure many are deterred by the trip downtown because of the \""parking\"" situation.  Well, folks you are missing out.  I will be back!"	1
Our in-laws suggested Dr. Battle and company when our dog, Levi, suddenly got ill.  The staff was very kind and caring even when the diagnosis was not positive.  They gave us as much time as we needed to stay with Levi and were sympathetic.	1
Hands down the best Gyros in Pittsburgh! There are four types of gyros to choose from: Lamb & beef, chicken, steak and vegetarian.\n\nThere are long lines at lunch time but, they move quick. Seating is hard to come by as well. You best bet is to get it to go.\n\nThey offer all types of different things like burgers, wings, shrimp, salads, tuna melts, steak hoagies and much more.\n\nThey offer Daily Specials as well.\n\nMonday  - Free Fries with any sandwich\nTuesday  - Chicken Gyro with fries\nWednesday  - Shish Ka Bob Salad\nThursday  - Gyro and fries\nFriday  - Fish Sandwich and fries\n\nThe only things that I don't like is that they close at 3pm daily and they're not open on the weekend.\n\nIf God made gyros this is what they would taste like!	1
Great place for lunch!\n\nThe reviews on yelp don't do this place justice.  The food coming out of the kitchen looked great --- especially the gyro's and french fries.\n\nI opted for the Quad-S (my term not theirs) Summer Sensation Salad with Salmon.  Big salad, not skimping on the ingredients, and nice piece of fish on top.\n\nI'll definitely be back. (once I finish my tour of lunch spots in Pittsburgh, I'm on about #45 without repeating)\n\nPlenty of seating, and they move you through quick despite the lines....	1
so, i go in and order a gyro (yee-ro - you know, how you're supposed to say it).  the server goes you mean a 'jai-ro?!' (as in gyroscope), in a very loud kind of condescending voice.  i said, no, i mean a 'yee-ro'.  as if she didn't know what i was talking about anyway!\n\nwith the greek authenticity of the place seriously in question, i should've walked away then, but i was really hungry and didn't have a lot of time for lunch.  it was just average, nothing special.  again, i've been spoiled by NYC.  besides, i think it's a good policy to not eat where they can't properly pronounce what they're serving.	0
I always enjoy coming here for lunch.\n\nI love that Zorba's has specials everyday- I usually come on Thursdays for the Gyro Special. The gyro is good and they are very, very generous on the yummy fresh cut fries. \n\nI've also had the buffalo chicken salad and it's piled high. The handbreaded fish is huuuuge.(way larger than the roll that it's on) and handbreaded.. so winner winner, fish dinner (or lunch!)\n\nIf I were rating Zorba's homemade ranch, it'd be an easy 5 stars. sometimes I pack my lunch (a quick sandwhich and some crackers) then head over to Zorba's just for some fries and ranch, hahaha!	1
This coffeeshop is a winner.\n\nThey have deli foods, which always have a happy line, but I've never managed to try them.  I made a beeline for the back of the shop, where they probably have fifty varieties of coffee beans, and at least as many varieties of tea.  Behind the coffee, in a glass-walled room, is the roaster, this enormous machine that lets them roast the beans fresh, all the time, in the store.\n\nBehind the counter is an older guy named John Prestogeorge.  When I asked him for a recommendation, he suggested the J.P. Hearty blend on their coffee list, which is a blend he started selling in the 1960's.  He's still there.  It's still good.  Lately, I've moved to the organic sumatran, and really want to try the kona; I'm confident they'll be around for awhile, and I'll be headed back.	1
"The perfectly balanced cappuccino -- skim milk, extra shot --warmed the cockles of my heart.\n\n$9.49 for an aromatic pound of Italian Blend espresso beans lovingly roasted on premise had my wallet  -- and then our espresso machine -- singing \""O Sole Mio.\""\n\nNattily dressed coffologists -- sporting plaid button-fronts and page-boy caps -- ignited the same butterflies that drove my obsession with \""Newsies\"" in middle school.\n\nSo many reasons to love this little independent wonder."	1
We rotate our coffee purchases between here and La Prima.  It's a tad overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking for, but the staff is ready and willing to help direct you to a coffee bean that is perfect for your taste.  We've tried many different varieties of the dark blends, and all are delicious.  I highly recommend giving this place a try!	1
This place rocks! The coffee selection is out of this world and the coffee itself is wonderful! It is smooth and just terrific!	1
My family has been going to the Strip and shopping at Prestogeorge for years. When I moved to the DC area I couldn't find any coffee as good as Prestogeorge's. Luckily, you can order online and have it shipped to your house. Every time I order it comes to my door the next day. This is such a plus for me since I always wait until the last minute to order coffee when I'm running low. You can order whole beans or have them ground to your specific coffee pot/french press. My favorite flavor of coffee is coconut cream. My only complaint is that they don't send you a receipt via email or shipping confirmation. But really, who needs an email when it comes the next day with a printed receipt in the box? Please give this place a try if you're looking for the best and freshest coffee around!	1
They have an extensive assortment of coffee beans and a friendly, quick staff. I wound up getting their Sumatra beans and loved them.	1
This is, by far, one of my favorite places in the Strip District! My favorite tea is the China Rose tea, which not only has a beautiful look to it, but has a wonderful taste! The Apple Caramel Almond is also very good, complete with halved almonds! The milk oolong tea is a little more pricey, but tastes almost like buttery popcorn! It is so unique and exquisite. There are so many coffees and teas to choose from that you could get lost all day just smelling the coffees and choosing which ones you want to take home! You can buy tea pots and infusers here to accompany your new loose leaf teas if you need something new or want to try different ways to drink tea. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. Depending on the tea, for about 2 oz of loose leaf teas or coffee, you are looking at a minimum of $1 and some change! The space is small, so it can be overwhelming when it's busy, but once the crowd dies down, you can really take your time and enjoy the coffees and teas without feeling rushed. Definitely check out this place, you won't be disappointed!	1
Since recently taking a more serious interest in brewing my own coffee, I am willing to go in search of a better bean.  Prestogeorge is top of my list.  \n\nI always marvel at their selection of coffees, the different types of beans and roasts.  The wall off coffee can be intimidating, but the staff is knowledgeable and helpful without being pretentious.  I started off with the JP Hearty Blend and was not disappointed.  I've since purchased other blends including the Italian espresso (which I used to make some delicious chocolate covered espresso beans) and the Vienna Roast (which I use for cold brewing).  Loose leaf tea is also available as well as brewing supplies.  If flavored coffee is more your thing, it is definitely not in short supply here.  Prestogeorge also serves beverages and some food items but I have never tried anything prepared there.  \n\nThe cost of their coffee and supplies is more than reasonable when compared to national brands available in local grocery stores.  And for coffee roasted on site where you can watch the process, you can't beat it.	1
The atmosphere and service from this restaurant were a welcome change from much of what we received the rest of our stay in Pittsburgh. The staff seemed genuinely friendly and attentive. \n\nThe food was good- not outstanding but definitely one of the best meals I had in the city. I ordered salmon, which was cooked perfectly. My friends had the pasta tasting, which for it's price seemed very reasonable. Pasta dishes never impress me the way other dishes do, but teh three offered this night were on the lighter side and a nice variety.\n\nOh why lie, they each had three servings and I was eating off their plates. That food was gooood!	1
I really enjoyed my experience at Lidia's.  My friend and I were seated promptly, and we shared an order of the crab fricos, which were quite good.  For my main course, I had a calamari dish with large beans.  I can't remember the name of it, and it's not on the menu online, so ... but all I can say is that my mouth started salivating as I was writing this, so you know it was good.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate cake, which was incredibly rich.  I don't think we finished it, but it was good.\n\nAll in all, a very pleasant experience.  Would love to go again.	1
Somehow I thought the place was going to be fancier.  The way the concierge at the hotel spoke of it, it sounded like it was going to be expensive and busy.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see entrees that weren't too expensive and a very comfortable atmosphere!  It was a welcome warm spot on a cold November night!\n\nI had the Pasta 3-course meal and was thrilled! - cesaer salad, all-u-can-eat 3 types of pastas and any dessert off of the dessert menu!  I thoroughly enjoyed 2 of the 3 pastas and particularly liked the meat raviolis.  Very tasty!  While it was an all-u-can-eat offer, we really didn't have much more than small amounts of each, as all the portions were hearty and filling.\n\nThe wine list had a selection of $28 bottles that were not fantastic, but tasty for the price.  And the ambiance was enjoyable.  Our group of 8 had pretty good service, and definitely enjoyed our experience there.\n\nSide note:  Not an Italian dish, but the night we were there one of their specials was Hungarian Goolash, that was raved about by the 1 person at our table who ordered it!	1
"First time at Lidia's, although I've wanted to go there every time I'm in Pittsburgh.\n\nI got the prix fixe Lidia's Trio del Giorno.  Started off with a great Caesar's salad (Insalata \""Cesare\"" alla Lidia), followed by three pasta dishes, and ended with an interesting choice for dessert.  \n\nThe pastas were right out of the kitchen - the farfalle with fennel, caramelized onions, sausage, and some tomatoes, was fantastic.  The gnocchi were great, and the linguine with basil pasta and shrimp was good but not on par with the other two pastas.  \n\nThe dessert was an olive oil and basil torte with lemon ice cream (my description doesn't adequately describe it) - I should've written down the description from the menu, although I did upload a photo of the dessert.\n\nThe wait staff was outstanding - attentive without being intrusive.  The decor is awesome - especially the backlit wall with wine bottles.  \n\nI hope to be in Pittsburgh again very soon and will definitely go back to Lidia's."	1
"If you like the Olive Garden, you'll LOVE Lidia's!  \n\nWe were a party of two on a Sunday night -- the restaurant was moderately busy.  Our server was a bit of a space cadet.  We had to stop another waiter to ask for more water...I was never offered a refill on my diet coke (which sat empty for over 30 minutes).\n\nThe salmon was very good, but drenched in so much olive oil and garlic that an oil slick was left on the plate at the end of the meal.  The pasta tasting was....kind of weird.  One of the selections tasted like feet, the other tasted like something I could make at home with a bottle of Prego.  The best was a mushroom ravioli in olive oil -- but there was so much oil (see a theme?) I had to scrape it off before eating.\n\nLong story short, we passed on dessert.   The food was adequate, the service was sub-par, and it was just kind of a \""meh\"" experience.\n\nI won't go back."	0
We went to treat A's parents for their anniversary - his mom has been obsessed with this lady forever. I had an amazing lobster risotto, A had the osso bucco, and his mom tried the pasta trio, which was divine. His dad had something spicy and in marinara sauce...looked godd. Neat atmosphere, and knowledgeable waitstaff...	1
I'm not a big Italian fan, but since we are up north where the best Italian is, I wanted to try it. Breads were served with strawberry, apricot, and crunchy sugar butter. That was great. We were in for brunch on Sunday. I had the Filet and was not super impressed with the meat, but the potato wedges were quite tasty. Then dessert, I loved most, but the almond/hazelnut cristota was to die for. Hubby had Pasta Trio and was satisfied. Would go back.	1
Good food and beautiful space. My family and I were here the other night. We had gnocchi with duck; lamb chops; the fish of the day; grilled salmon and the pasta trio.\nThe gnocchi with the duck was outstanding. The other entrees were very good. The pasta trio last night was slightly disappointing. Ravioli, Papardelle and Penne a la Vodka-lacked something. Overall, a nice meal. I would go back.	1
Let's see....an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the heart of the strip named after a woman with her own Italian cooking show? Should be great, right? Not so much.\n\nWent here recently and ordered the pasta trio, since this is apparently what one gets at Lidias. Perhaps I went on the wrong day, but I thought that the three pastas (bolognese sauce, pesto sauce, and gnocchi with sage butter) were underwhelming. At the very least, there are Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that offer much better food for a similar price.\n\nThe one positive to Lidia's was the dessert - which was fantastic. I had a bite of a chocolate torte, and was very impressed. The coffee with grappa was also quite nice.\n\nAll things told, though, I would spend my money elsewhere.	0
If you're new to the steel city, and want consistently superb modern Italian, this is your place.  The menu has standards you grew up loving, as well as modern dishes and new twists on classic gems!  The staff is attentive and informative without being overbearing; the wine list is extensive, and the well drinks are stiff...	1
I went here on a crowded saturday night with a large party (8 people at our table.) I ordered the spicy calamari. It was not spicy. It was overcooked, like rubber, and served on plain white beans. Yuck. I won't go back. My boyfriend had the seafood dish. Most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless.	0
I was very disappointed with my meal here. I expected way more from Lidia's. As a regular viewer of the show I was expecting fresh / rustic Italian meals. What I ended up with was stuffed pasta that I'm 95% sure was reheated in a microwave, bland mains, and slow and inattentive service. The only highlight of the meal was the bread which was the only fresh ingredient used in the entire meal.	0
WAAAAY over priced and although their appetizers were good, I'm not sure if it's bc we went in August and the kitchen was hot and the cooks were sweating their butts off back there but they salted their pastas WAAAAY too much. One of the pastas in their trio had sun dried tomatoes and capers in it. You'd think they'd tone down the saltiness of the pasta to let the saltiness of the sundries tomatoes and capers pull it together but no. I felt like I was eating strands of salt.  The ambiance is great and their wine menu is extensive. Maybe it was a bad day but I think I can find better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh with it's strong Italian roots.	0
I was really looking forward to Lidia's.  And was really disappointed.  \n\nBread was good. The cocktails were good.  The service was attentive and friendly (just don't get between a server dishing out the unlimited pasta and a hungry customer who clearly hadn't reached their limit with the unlimited servings).  \n\nToo bad the food wasn't good.  The beet salad was underwhelming.  I had the calamari which was rubbery and swimming in a tasteless chicken broth and white beans.  I felt even more sad for my dining companion who had such fond memories of the calamari.  I suspect such positive memories are no longer :(\n\nMy other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy.  Another disappointment.   \n\nAnd thus my rating of Meh. Which is a huge shame.  But life goes on...	0
Very good.  Great atmosphere for a date or special occasion.  The Pasta trio is always great.  On Sunday they offer family style for $25(Salad, Entree, Dessert).  \n\nGrilled Octopus, Lasagna, salads are very good.  Will be going back soon.	1
Went here for brunch yesterday. \n\nWhat we sampled: \nMimosa (I don't like mimosas, but this was delicious with fresh squeezed orange juice)\nBread basket (sea salt foccacia (delicious) cranberry and almond scones (delicious, but very crumbly which the fiance found out the hard way) strawberry butter, sugar butter, and honey butter)\nAntipasta table (overall good selection, but a little bland, the only memorable thing on the table for us was the Cesar salad, which was delicious, but a tad overdressed) \nEntree (we both ordered the pasta trio.  The three choices were penne with onions, sausage, and tomato ragu (the least favorite), Homemae fettucine aglio e olio with tomatoes and butternut squash (delicious and very fresh tasting for the fall), and homemade mushroom ravioli in a thyme butter sauce (the best selection by far and completely delicious)\nDessert table (good selections with standouts being the tiramisu and the chocolate torte)\n\nOverall this was a great brunch experience for the price as well as the selections.  We would definitely return.	1
This place had horrible service. I waited (sitting at the bar non-the-less) for about 10 minutes before the loser bartender got me a drink and a menu. The food was weak, I got a Caesar salad and the wild bore stuffed ravioli. I was horrible. It was like they took some pulled pork and just stuffed a spoonful in a ravioli. I will not return, too many other better restaurants are in town to waste your time on this one.	0
We were at Lidia's for an early dinner before seeing a show.  They have a great wine list and our server made some excellent suggestions.  The food was wonderful.  Several of us had the Pasta Trio.  This is a sampler dish with three different pastas prepared and served at your table.  Afterwards, you can get additional servings of your favorite from the Trio.  Of course, none of us even had room for an additional serving.  If you get the Trio, I'd recommend getting the option that includes the salad and dessert.  It's a great deal and you know you'll want it anyway!	1
as a big fan of Lidia's, i was anxious to eat at her restaurant, and it was totally awesome. would highly recommend.  Food was excellent. wait staff was attentive. we arrived early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  it was a lot of fun and the decor was awesome too.	1
The NY restaurant is much better.  We were eating here often, but it got boring quickly. The staff are great and the location is good for people who drive into Pittsburgh. I'd like to see some the dishes that make the NY restaurant great.	0
Overall this was good Italian food if you're ready to venture into something more asventerous than Olive Garden.  I had the pasta trio and thought the ravioli was amazing.  Everything else was pretty good, but a butternut squash ravioli made the meal.  Be prepared to spend about $30 a person for the full experience and I'll remember this meal for a while.	1
After walking around the Strip District, this certainly hit the spot. We did the buffet, and I got the pasta trio. I was not disappointed. Endless amounts of great pasta, plus everything else that came with the buffet table. It's a classy place, but people from all walks of life were eating there, from people dressed in Steelers gear to older, well-dressed couples. I'd definitely come back or go to her other restaurant.	1
"My family had been planning to go to Lidia's for a while, and finally made a reservation for my dad's birthday. I was not really impressed with the whole experience overall. We got there for our reservation and it took a while for anyone to come greet us at the front of the place, even though it wasn't very busy. They seated us outside, but the outdoor seating is right next to the street and it wasn't very pleasant. They were nice enough to move us inside without complaint. We ordered drinks, which took a long time to get there. I had the pasta trio special, I really liked the idea of getting to sample three different fresh recipes. I only really liked one (I know it changes up though) and only got a refill of that one. My sister got the seafood alfredo, which she said was good. I don't even remember what my parents ordered because it wasn't very memorable. Although the service was decent and the food was okay, I was just generally unimpressed and felt like we paid a lot for just a \""meh\"" experience and food."	0
One word; gross. This is not Italian food - it's Pittsburgh italian food. The ravioli is not fresh - how difficult is it for a restaurant to make fresh ravioli? The decor is tacky. The wine list is lacking. I could rip this place apart after only one disappointing meal, but I'm not going to waste my time. In short, avoid this place! You can do much better in your own kitchen!	0
This was my first experience at Lidia's and it was amazing.  It was a rare evening out for my wife and I and we enjoyed our meal immensely. \n\nThe food was very good...3 to 4 stars at least.  We ordered the pasta Trio and the creativity behind the dishes was very impressive.  The only thing taking away from it was the execution on the pasta itself. The fettuccine was cooked well past al dente and bordered on soggy.  The ravioli however were perfect And the flavor profiles on all the dishes were spot on\n\nThe reason I gave a five star review on 3 to 4 star food was the service. Everyone without exception was very attentive, friendly, helpful, and generally awesome.  This team could've served hot dogs and it still would've seem like an amazing experience.	1
I've eaten plenty of less-than-delicious Italian food, but fortunately more of the delicious kind, whether in the motherland or here at home in the states. While I had high expectations for Lidia's, it gets lumped into the former category. I really hate to say this, but Olive Garden's dishes have more flavor than those we ordered at Lidia's (and I don't even like OG...). I ordered the pasta trio and all three were oh so bland, as was my mother's lasagna bolognese. My S.O. ordered the boar raviolis (I know they weren't called that, but I know nothing of porcines as far as food goes) and thought they were just 'meh' and too salty.  The menu was pretty limited, and it was especially underwhelming considering the prices of the dishes. I wouldn't return here, there are a couple of other restaurants in Pgh that I would rather visit next time i'm in the mood for Italian. Service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant though.	0
Not a place I'd return to for regular fare, overpriced for quality.  But the brunch is a divine value.	1
My husband watches Lidia every Saturday on Create.  We make a weekend trip to Pa, and were both excited to visit this restaurant.  Per other reviews, we chose to go to Sunday brunch.  This was an excellent choice.\nYou're offered complimentary mimosa or Bloody Mary.  You then have an antipasti buffet which has a staff member who stands there making sure everything is kept fresh, and to answer any questions.  He also took our soup to our table to allow us to continue getting items from the buffet.  You have about 16 choices on the buffet, not including soup, meats.\nWe both chose to have the pasta trio - where you are initially given 3 small portions of the daily special pasta, with ordering more as needed.\nThe desserts are phenomenal.  You have cookies, fruit, tiramisu, cakes.\nIf my husband wasn't as full as he was, I would have had him roll me out the door ;-)	1
Our boss treated some co-workers and myself to lunch here last week (one of my colleagues was leaving) and had a terrific time. The decor is amazing and so is the food. I had the Porchetta panino (pulled pork Shoulder with horseradish apple salsa) which came with these parsely-seasoned home fries. All of it was amazing. Like Darren (I was so jealous he got to go there back in February and I didn't), I had the Torta di Cioccolatta, and it was godly. The service was on-target too. I love this place and that it's so close to where I now work. Seriously gourmet.	1
Lidia's is a good restaurant for Italy food.  Though there is little bit loud, food here are really awesome. \n$6 is needed for valet.	1
I'm not sure why people like this place so much.  The wait was long, the food came out cold, and the pastas were overcooked, gluey, greasy messes. The service was friendly but the food was very poor. Will never go back.	0
I've had some excellent meals here when there were 3 or 4 of us.  I've had two group functions that were  way less than wonderful. I would not entertain having an event for any more than 4 people.  Even 10 people taxed the staff!	0
Went here for an early Valentine's Dinner last night. The service was great. We both ordered the pasta trio and the waiters' were very attentive at filling up our plates as soon as they neared empty. We also got the Polito appetizer to start and it was delicious- mix of octopus, potatoes, capers, onions and olives. Also, their wine bottles for $29 are a great deal. Just took off one star for the decor- a little outdated. Still a great night though- definitely recommend.	1
Great food and service, very pleased with my Valentine's day dinner here.  Planning to come back to try more of their fare, since their Valentine's day menu was limited.	1
I visited a few years back and had quite a pleasurable experience. The Sunday brunch for $25 included your choice of a mimosa or bloody mary, unlimited access to the soup/antipasti/salad buffet, entr\u00e9e of choice and unlimited trips to the dessert table. This is quite a value, plus everything was delicious. The fresh pasta trio is amazing. My only complaint involved the background music. The house system was playing classic rock, which is totally inappropriate and out of place for such a nice establishment.	1
"What an embarrassment. Rotten/black  salad greens. A server with a black eye. Pedestrian \""signature\"" pasta. Plates and glasses left uncleared. Greasy, scratchy plates at buffet. All yours for $28 per person!"	0
Had dinner with my son last night and it was fabulous. He went for the ribeye and I had roasted chicken. We started with the grilled calamari which was decent, could have used more calamari and less chick peas. The main courses were cooked perfectly and delish!  Definitely will go back when returning to Pittsburgh.	1
We finally made it to Lydia's and unfortunately it was disappointing! \nThe olive spreads that come with the bread basket were gritty and tasteless. \nThe lasagne I ordered was flavorless as well. The pasta in the lasagna was a nice texture. \nMy husband ordered the $42 steak, he ordered it mid rare and it was a bit over cooked but the issue with the steak was the flavor if a dirty grill. \nThe Tiramisu was very good also the calamari appetizer was terrific. \nThe service was good but she hovered too much for me personally. \nWe also had several drinks....\nSo, in the end $180 left a bad taste in my mouth..........	0
"Not impressed by this restaurant.  Ordered the pasta trio, which was recommended by the waitress and was labeled on the menu as \""all you can eat\"".  The staff service gave small portions of each and hardly returned for further portions.  If I wanted \""all you can eat\"" I would have been at the restaurant all night waiting to be served.  The pasta was cold when served.  The frozen pasta from my son's school fundraiser was better.  I would not recommend nor would I ever return."	0
Only average at best and when you figure in the slow service, cold food and high price i cant even give it an average rating. You can get better Italian food at any hole in the wall in Philadelphia, New York or Boston any time. i wanted to love it so much after watching Lidia on TV but the restaurant doesn't bring her own magic to the table it seems.	0
Classy Wonderful establishment. Visited for my mother's 60th birthday.   She was astonished. For that very reason,  I love this place. The food was great the servicew was excellent.  Kudos to Waiter Cheno!!!  Well definitely visit again.	1
Having basic cable for a few years now, I guess I missed who Lidia is. But her restaurant is sure nice. Wonderful and attentive service, nice atmosphere, and large portions of tasty food. I had the gnocchi, which comes with duck ragu - fantastic! I'm a huge fan of duck, and this was a new approach for me. The duck played really well with the thick ragu sauce. Not the best potato dumplings in a gnocchi, but still quite good. My friends dishes were also great, especially the lasagna which was massive.\n\nA nice comfort Italian joint with some unique twists and lovely service. Strikes me as a good spot that can please many different tastes.	1
I've been here for a brunch which I really enjoyed. You just helped yourself to a buffet. It was of course scrumptious! Don't remember exactly what I had but remember it was good!	1
What a disappointment. When the water glass cracked in my hand as the server poured and soaked us, we should have known it would be that kind of evening. Worst part of the meal was the pasta trio--the limpest, pastiest, most tasteless mass of lukewarm pasta I have ever been served. One waiter saved the day by insisting I reorder, while everyone else in the joint was content to let us stew. Every aspect of the experience was substandard although when I reordered, the beet salad was very good. Overall, Lidia should be ashamed to have her name on a place like that.	0
We were so looking forward to the food but our experience was awful. The restaurant is too large with modern decor with hideous red plastic/leatherette chairs but at lunchtime it had no character. There was no background music. The waiter was young and inexperienced. It seems that now that Lidia is famous she is no longer involved in the cooking  so the food is like any larger chain or worse without the quality control. Table cloth was dirty, the staff was not friendly and the decor and furniture were unkept. The best part were the breadsticks and dips with olive oil. Would not recommend it.	0
Have always had superior meals here. Wine selection is good. Service is always top-notch.	1
Lidia, you should be ashamed! This spot wouldn't have lasted a year in NYC. Citizens of Pittsburgh, don't be fooled. Lidia's is average at best. I ate here when it opened,a and again 4 years later. Nothing has changed. We did have some great bar nibbles, quality cocktails, and a good bottle of wine off of a pretty good list, but the food and service lacked. For starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads. The took away everything and only brought back fresh salads (mind you, we were one of about 10 tables being served that evening!). The entrees were dull and lacked seasoning. The servers were confused (how many times does it take to ask fro fresh pepper?) and our waiter seemed to hand off our table to another server. It's tough to find anything good here. Just another 'poser'.	0
I had really high expectations for this place but the food was overpriced & bland my lasagna tasted like it was made by Stouffers. The service was excellent the food nothing great.	0
Traditional pizza is awesome. Delivery is very fast as well. They always tell me 40 minutes and then arrive in 15-20.	1
The Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum pizza is an exotic treat! I also liked their cinnamon sticks to death! Very good. I can't believe they delivered to us all the way from downtown in such short time. Awesome pizza joint.	1
Ephesus is special.  Fast friendly service.  Surprisingly comfy and stylish seating and lighting for a primarily take out shop.  A broad, customizable menu with a solid mix of Italian and Greek deliciousness.  Low prices, massive portions, and better prepared, home made, flavorful food than they have any right to offer at the prices they charge.  \n\nEphesus is not a 5 star culinary experience, but for the casual fare and reasonable rates they offer, I can't imagine a better choice.  Well done Ephesus, you set the bar for all other local delivery spots to try to live up to!	1
When you are there order the Ephesus Pizza. It is their signature pizza, cant go wrong. Has many recipes on it; vegetables, chicken or pork shish kabobs(yes,heard me right, shish kabobs on a pizza), honestly one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.	1
This is the best pizza I have found in Pittsburgh so far. It makes me sad that it has taken me four years of tasting quite mediocre pizza before finding this gem. So far my favorite is the steak pizza, however, it is all delicious.	1
Too oily , i felt like im eating pure fat , even the bread is covered with oil ! I suggest they make it healthier with more whole wheat option, grape leaves are very dry and tasteless. Oh and their fries are terrible	0
This place is fanfreakingtastic.  \n\nThusly, I have had their Chicken Ranchero Pizza and their Greek Pizza, and their cheesy breadsticks, and good. gravy.  I can't even put into words how good the pies were.  The toppings were all super fresh, the meat expertly seasoned, the sauces to die for.  Their list of gourmet pies is mindblowing; their variety and inventiveness is spectacular.  I was skeptical about feta and fontina on my pizza.  Mea culpa.  I don't know if I'll ever go back to just run of the mill plain pies ever again.\n\nI've had my orders delivered all three times I've ordered from the place since moving there, and while they're a bit slow, it's worth the wait.	1
Okay, so I've heard a lot of good things about this place. And I wanted to like it!\n\nBut it was seriously bad. I very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because I don't like it. But I couldn't eat it. I got the Shadyside and it was super greasy, and the flavor just wasn't there. My roommate got the Portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.\n\nThe guy who served us was cool beans though.	0
This is a regular stop of mine because I work on the strip in Pittsburgh. I want to share that I have probably eaten here 40+ times so I have tried about 10 hoagies on the menu. I went with the regular Steak and cheese hoagie- grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo...add some hot sauce at the table, order of fresh cut fries and a drink. I get a work discount of 10% so anywhere you can eat lunch under $8 is awesome in any city.\n\nMy only complaint is that occasionally the meat to bread ratio isn't too great. Don't get me wrong I'm not expecting 12 ounces of meat but it can be disappointing. I recommend one of the more creative sandwiches then. Though the breads here are so fresh and enjoyable.	1
Very nice hotel in a great, convenient location.	1
Priceline, 69 bucks.  Pick 4-star and downtown Pittsburgh and you'll get either this or the Omni.  Walking distance from all sporting events.  Use the self-park across the street and you'll save $$ over the valet (which also uses the same parking garage).  Rooms are small-ish, but the location is totally worth it.  Bar in the hotel has great service and good drinks.  Con- no longer affiliated w/ the Bally's next door (it went out of business), but they will give you a day pass to the Gold's a few blocks away.	1
I never write reviews, but I have to recommend the Renaissance! The staff was ABSOLUTELY wonderful! I was traveling for business so I hardly had any down-time at the hotel... but I had a lovely, clean room with a nice bathroom. The parking garage across the street was very convenient and reasonably priced.\n\nWhen I checked out, I accidentally left my cell phone charger plugged into the wall and my raincoat in the closet (clearly I was in a hurry in the morning and not very careful!) I called the hotel that night and they were very nice and said someone from Housekeeping would get back to me the next day. Someone from housekeeping called me the next morning and she was so sweet. They mailed me both items for no charge (I offered to give them a credit card, but they said no.) I receive the package within 3 days of returning from my stay. They truly went above and beyond! I'd definitely recommend staying there.	1
Beautiful old building, five minute walk to PNC park.  Our visit was to see the Phillies and get a taste of Pittsburgh.  Great view of PNC Park from our room.  I felt the hotel and service were first class, yet the place was not stuffy at all.  We will definitely be back!	1
This is my default hotel when I'm staying in Pittsburgh.  The rooms were remodeled a few years ago, which was really needed.  This is a quiet hotel right in the heart of the business district.  Rooms are mixed - some are very small and have interior veiws, others are huge and have views of the river.  There is a very nice gym in the basement - cardio and strength equipment (if that isn't good enough, you can get a free pass to Golds a few blocks away).\n\nOne caution - this place does tend to fill up / usually the first hotel downtown to sell out.	1
Great location - make sure you ask for a view of the river.  Worth the money.	1
Renaissance is a beautiful hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. I've stayed on the North Shore, Station Square and city outskirts before, but this was my first time down here. I was not disappointed.\n\n- Location is its biggest plus, right near the theaters and Heinz Hall. Also within a short walking distance to Gateway Station, Market Square and right across the Clemente Bridge to PNC Park. \n- Convenient parking garage right across the street. Cheap rates on the weekend.\n- Comparable and reasonable pricing (although I do get Gov. rate).\n- A couple of good restaurants on site.\n- Very nice room with a great view of the city.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to come back here again. A great find in the city.	1
Beautiful spot for a wedding. Very clean, the food was amazing (not your average wedding fare) and a breathtaking view of the city.  I cannot imagine a more beautiful hotel venue for a wedding.	1
This is my favorite hotel in Pittsburgh.\n\nYou can't beat the location.  In the heart of the theater district separated from PNC Park by only the Clemente Bridge, close to plenty of solid dining options, walking distance from Heinz Field, walking distance to nightlife . . . \n\nBig rooms with unbelievably comfortable beds.  Likely to have a gorgeous view of the river, bridges, and stadiums (directly across the river from PNC Park), easy parking (valet or parking garage directly across the street) . . . \n\n5 stars	1
I travel all over North America the majority of the year, and have stayed at almost every Renaissance in the US. I've gotta say, this one is one of my favorites. My stay was on a Thursday night, and had a room on the 10th floor facing East.\n\nIt's located right down town in the theater area, and it's an extremely easy walk to a lot of essentials. There are convenience stores a couple buildings down, and tons of bars and restaurants to check out all around.\n\nThe valets at the front door are extremely polite and will open the doors for you and call you a cab if you need it, and the front desk people are extremely friendly and will help you with whatever you need.\n\nThe rooms are great, and the beds are extremely comfortable. The rooms have large desks, which are great if you are doing paperwork or have to setup to do some business work in your room. TV's are great and have good programming, the beds are super comfy, and the bathrooms are large with good showers.\n\nAfter being here, this is probably the only hotel in Pittsburgh that I will ever want to stay at again.	1
Good food worth waiting, and waiting, and waiting for...  Now wait & wait for the check.	0
Lori was working at the front desk the evening we checked in (7/24/14).  She was fabulous!  Thanks for the help, Lori.\n\nBeautiful place, great Wi-Fi.\n\nErin	1
Great environment great location with easy parking and access to Downtown Pittsburgh.	1
The absolute loudest hotel I've stayed at in a long LONG time. Paper thin wall,  poor booking practices ended us up in the middle of the most obnoxious wedding party ever. Drunk bride, hotel room parties until 3am, and an apparent lack of security to monitor anything going on in this hotel have lead to this rave early Saturday morning (and I do mean RAVE quite literally) review. And yes this was after the front desk was called several times with noise complaints. My best tip would be to not stay here unless the purpose of your stay is to not sleep.	0
I love the Convention Center.  I go to the car shows every year here, and they always put together a great program no matter what it is.  It is a great venue with a ton of room.  Not to mention, they have little concession stands set up that serve up some delicious food that will keep you satisfied.	1
A friend and I came here last month for a car show and had a pretty good time. The place is ginormous! It's also clean, and that's pretty much all I can say about it. We didn't eat there, so I can't comment on the food. The convention center is probably underutilized. I'd like to see a big comics convention come here for instance.	1
I was lucky enough that the conference I had to attend (which changes cities every year) was in Pittsburgh the year I gave a seminar! I really enjoyed riding the bus downtown to the Convention Center everyday, and the venue is really beautiful. Located right on the river, the balcony views from the upper tiers of the center are pretty fantastic. Furthermore, the maze inside was pretty easily navigable- this was really important to me because I had to get in and out of rooms quickly as seminars started and stopped every 20 minutes. Compared to other venues I've been to across the country, the David L. Lawrence Convention Center stacks up well. It was great to see Pittsburgh showcased in such a great light.	1
"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Err not too sweet. I live in Bloomfield near the Childrens Hospital. Took my moo moo pie on a walk down (about 25 minutes in the RAIN) to Bow Wow or whatever just to see what they were about and to kind of get a feel for what type of doggie day care this was and some general information.\n\nNot only when I came in dripping wet from the rain there wasn't anyone up front to greet me. She brushed me and my dog off when I asked her about more information. She had an attitude with me didn't really care to go in depth with me about anything. It was kind of \""We do this we do that\"" I ultimately ended up walking out on her mid-sentence. Complete waste of time. I don't usually write negative reviews but geeze if you treat animals better than you treat people fine but I at least deserve some respect.\n\nHer overall attitude was \""I don't even know you I don't even care to know you unless you want to pay for our services.\"" If that's the attitude you want to have I'll pass."	0
This is a fantastic hotel.  I went to a convention here at the end of June and loved the setting.  The convention center is well setup and the link between the hotel and the convention center works really well, especially if it's raining.\n\nMy only complaint is that the elevators are slow during busy times.	1
When I think of Westins, I think of business-classy, nice and modern. This hotel has a classic feel to it, but definitely not very updated. Unfortunately, it reminds me of the staid-ness of Pittsburgh too much.\n\nThe check-in desk was super slow during my stay there. I do like the fact that there's a Fish Market downstairs. I don't like the fact that it's the convention center hotel, so it can get pretty crowded. That said, it's within walking distance to the Strip, and Downtown, so you can't deny the convenience. Still, I think there are newer hotels that provide the same.	0
Great location, close to the convention center and many fine restaurants in the Strip District. Love the Heavenly beds and the shower with multiple heads. Spacious, clean & attractive rooms. \n\nLoses a star because the free internet is slow as hell, clearly to entice you to pay for faster speeds. Ugh. If I'm on a business trip, I want to be able to work in my room, and having to pay extra for the privilege of working efficiently is not cool.	1
Overall a solid hotel, I've stayed here 4 of the last 5 weeks so I have a decent sample size.\n\nPros:\n- BEST gym in any hotel I've ever stayed (100lb dumbbells anyone?)\n- As SPG Platinum, always a high floor or great upgrade, even when busy\n- Consistently clean throughout\n- Visiting sports teams stay here if you're into celeb spotting\n- Check-in staff is friendly\n- Location is great, access to both strip and downtown\n- Option for 500 pts instead of room cleaning\n\nCons:\n- Tough to get a reservation sometimes and they don't cut breaks to regulars (not at discounted rates anyway)\n- Restaurant is ok at best\n- Can be some bizarre crowds depending on convention (http://www.anthrocon.org/ - I'm not hating, but it's unusual)	1
The hotel is kept clean and the room rates were very good.  The service from the staff was excellent.  Interestingly enough the restaurant in the hotel has the best sushi in Pittsburgh.	1
The Westin  convention Center is located downtown of Pittsburgh. I reserved a city sky view room on the 18th Floor with twin beds. I got a perfect beautiful view of the city from my windows. The room was clean with a large LCD TV, but the sink is inside the bathroom. If someone inside the bathroom, I can't brush or wash my face. I hardly got any sleep at night from the loud clinking plumbing sound from the next door usage of the bathroom. addional indoor Parking cost $19	1
I've stayed at this Westin a few days a week for about a month. While technically located downtown, it's more on the outskirts of downtown (just based on my observations). It is connected to the convention center but I've never been inside so I can't give an opinion on it.\n\nMy overall experience at the Westin has been positive. There is no 'Wow' factor but the gym is incredibly nice (but close at 10pm). The rooms are standard with all the normal Westin perks, such as a bathrobe, dual shower heads, and heavenly beds. There is an option for free slooooow internet but platinum members get internet for free (yay?). \n\nI hadn't noticed at first but after someone pointed it out, you'll notice there is an odor in the halls and rooms. It isn't very noticeable but its there.	1
Stayed here for a convention next door, mostly bc it was the most convenient. If I had realized how small DT Pittsburgh was I probably wouldve shopped around a little bit to save some $$$. This place was totally close to lots of things -- the river, the football and baseball stadiums, etc.\n\nBut anyways, had a good two-nite stay.  Clean and quiet rooms, friendly staff (tho I really got the impression that all Pittsburghians are just naturally super friendly.. at least compared to Angelenos). I happen to like that they are making cool environmentally-friendly efforts to save water, power, etc.  Others reviews mentioned it was a hassle to come home to a hot/cold/dark room, but I got two keys at check in (one to keep w/ me, one for the light-switch thing that runs the lights and ventilation). Easy. Problem solved. There wasnt a fridge in the room, but I requested one and someone brought it up within 15 minutes.\n\nThe internet was suuuuuper sloooow. And out of the 30 channels on the TV I think ~12 of them were sports. Ohs wells.	1
Nice hotel.  Check-in was extremely smooth and quick.  Hotel is very clean.  Room is nice.  Shower drain kind of sucks but I can deal with that.	1
We stayed here for pleasure, not business and it was great. We had the Astros staying at our hotel (what's up Brett Myers and J Happ?) so it's got to be pretty classy, right? Parking was expensive. If you self-park in the garage, you don't have in-out privileges and valet is $22/night. But that's the price you pay for staying in the city I guess. We were able to walk to PNC Park as well as other shops/restaurants in the theater district. Staff was great, rooms were clean and our view of the river was beautiful. \n\nMy only complaint was our neighbor's shower let off a high pitched, very loud whine when it was turned on. It woke us both up early. We were able to get back to sleep and we heard them fixing it later in the afternoon but it was annoying at the time.\n\nOther than that, I would stay here again. We got a great deal.	1
Beautiful rooms, excellent meeting spaces. The beds are like clouds and the double shower head in the bathroom was amazing. \n\nHowever, the customer service lacks excellence and the WiFi is completely unreliable.	0
Marginal at best for the money. The whole place really does not seem up to the standard of other Westin properties I have stayed at.	0
Conveniently located next to the Convention and Conference Center in the heart of downtown. Great furnishing and modern up-to-date amenities one would expect at a Westin property. Big full head rainfall shower and comfy pillow and mattresses to relax after a long day	1
completely worthless wifi.	0
"Facilities are very nice, beds are a little small for a couple.  At six am on 3/21/14 the neighboring room's alarm (1106) went off and cut right through the wall waking everyone up. I called the front desk at six thirty asking them to send someone to stop it, she said they would have to \""involve security\"". 8am now and it is still going full blast uninterrupted. Great start to a vacation courtesy of Weston."	0
This is my 2nd stay here and since I had to unload my car at the valet and bring my own 5 suitcases to my room on a valet car I am already disappointed in the service. I actually had to get on the elevator with my own luggage with other people with this big cart. Disappointed that the Fairmont had no vacancies. Ditch this hotel.	0
Valet lost my car keys and have been incredibly unprofessional! Completely unacceptable and I would warn everyone about using valet services here. Disgusted.	0
"OK, here's what you need to know first-- they do not serve raw oysters. Where I'm from, you can't call your restaurant an \""Oyster House\"" without raw oysters served, unless you want a good ass whoopin'. \n\nNothing else about this place remotely conveys \""Oyster House.\"" It's a fried seafood joint, that doesn't serve Yuengling nor takes credit cards. We got all of our food on Styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. The \""waitress\"" stood and watched us eat most of the meal. This particular lady had a substantial moustache and sideburns.  It was unsettling. You also have to pay before being served. \n\nThe New England Clam Chowder was good."	0
Pre-fab fried food. Decor has character. The beer is cheap.	0
Awesome chowder but that's it...	0
Horrible, go to Long John Silver's. I hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap .	0
"If this place could be described in four words, they would be:\n\nAngry, Sweaty, Dive-y, and DELICIOUS\n\nThis place is a Pittsburgh classic. Don't go here if your looking for some hip and trendy seafood joint. I'm pretty sure the decor hasn't changed in the past 50 years, but that's part of what makes it awesome.\n\nThe cashiers and cooks are angry, and slightly scary looking, but not in a bad way (if that makes any sense whatsoever). Their no-nonsense, \""soup-nazi\"" style fits with the classic blue-collar Pittsburgh motif this place is still holding on to. If you go in knowing what you want, you'll be fine.\n\nBottom line, and most importantly, the food. Pretty much everything is fried, but it's all good. Never too greasy, and only lightly breaded. When lent rolls around, you always see every restaurant in town with signs boasting, \""Voted Best Fish in Town.\"" I'm not sure who's voting, and how EVERY restaurant seems to have the best. Don't be fooled, Oyster House IS the best fried fish in town."	1
Walked in here xmas eve after primanti bros stopped serving out of the blue, despite us sitting at a table. Place is a total dive but that's part of it's charm. Fried fish between bread. Load up the hot sauce and tartar sauce, get some fried oysters and onion rings, and expect exactly what you ordered. This isn't le bernadin in nyc. Some of these reviews seem like they were expecting fine dining. CASH ONLY.	1
Had an awful crab cake here with little crab in it but mostly lots of breading and filler.. Even the Phillips brand ones at Costco are better than most. And of course Eleven has the best ever. But anyways, hubby got a deep fried cod filet that was sandwiched between 2 hamburger buns, which was pretty decent fried fish while it was hot and crispy... But my crab cake was sadly unforgivable.	0
My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch. Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. \n\nThe place was unacceptably dirty, our table was dirty the floor was dirty, heck even the walls seemed to have a layer of grime. Both the waitress and the bartender were extremely  rude. \n\nMy mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini, immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress, they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous!\n\n I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy, the fried scallops were disgusting.\n\nI understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow, will i be going back, methinks not!	0
Everything about this place seems very antiquated.  I wasn't impressed with my clam chowder.  There was some kind of bread component inside the clam chowder that may have been an attempt at dumplings but just tasted like soggy bread.  \n\nI'm not a fan	0
We stopped here expecting them to have raw bar options as their name would imply.  However, they have several cooked selections. That said, we only stopped into this location for a drink and then moved on.\n\nThe restaurant includes outdoor seating and a long straight bar that extends from the front of the restaurant to the rear.  Overall, the interior isn't spectacular, but has several nostalgic photos of famous people (both local and national), some of the photos autographed.\n\nTheir drink selection is simple with many local brews and mass produced American beers.	0
Had lunch here at the OOH on a cold day in early Spring. It was a Wednesday, and thankfully not a Friday in Lent where it would have been much busier.\n\nI opted for the dual crabcakes platter with two sides, and the crabcake was mushy, not fried long enough, and just lacking any reasonable portion of crab meat.\n\nI've had the fried oysters before, and they were pretty good.  I think your results might be highly dependent on what you order.\n\nThis lunch kinda sucked.	0
A native all my life and  never been, finally went last summer. I felt it was the thing to do. I did not like squeezing in that miniscule bar and eating on a table the size of a frisbee. Look, I love food, and rarely complain, but I feel I have to be honest. Like one guy said, they don't really need our kudos now, as they are there and will remain there. Just like Primanti's and Isaly's,,,,oh wait, haha. The food was passable but could be better. the Oysters were good, and if ever I do go back I will get just them because the crab cakes sucked. Sure, I am spoiled by the east coast cakes I have had in Jersey and Baltimore. And that is the only thumbs up Ballymore will ever get from me!OOH, trendy hotspot you should take visitors to, fill them with cold Irons and fried sea fare, then take them home and they can say they have been there.	0
I love crab cakes. Whenever they are on the menu I have to order it. I got the crab cake sandwich to feed my need for carbs on carbs. The crab cake tasted fine but in the end it was more filler then it was crab. When I eat a crab cake I want it to mostly be the main event filled with large chunks of crab. Sadly this one didn't do that for me.	0
This restaurant is horrible.  The waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  The only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  How can you call yourself an Oyster House and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  The food overall was ok.  I would never go or eat there again!	0
"TOURIST TRAP. I found this restaurant online and my hotel room magazine. It had a pretty good number of reviews and apparently the first bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh so I added it to my Pittsburgh dinner options list. It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old, tiny restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square. It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  \""Original Oyster House\"" but ironically they don't serve raw oysters, let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the \""first restaurant\"" in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign \""historical landmark.\"" If you're looking for good oysters, raw or not, or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is definitely NOT the place."	0
The worst most over breaded oysters ever...It's a dive to boot.	0
We were excited to try the Original Oyster House given its history and nice outdoor seating in market square. We were prepared for foam plates and cash only, which works for a nice lunch outside. Sadly we were disappointed with our meal. Our group of 3 tried the breaded oysters, famous fried fish, beer-battered fish nuggets, and crab cakes with fries and onion rings. Although the portions were generous for being fried, much of the food was soggy due to the excess of grease. We were in an area with a server, but the service was terrible. Our server continually ignored us and frequently forgot items she was supposed to bring to the point that we went inside to get the items ourselves. The food is a good deal if you are willing to overlook the service and like really greasy fried seafood.	0
I love the food here and on a nice day, there is nothing better than eating it outdoors. The combos are great. On my last visit I had the oversized fish sandwich. It was good, but the bun was dry and stale. I wish I'd ordered the oyster sandwich, but next time. They have great slaw and fries and the staff were very friendly and accomodating. Love it!	1
Only has 1 person working and serving the restaurant. Took 15 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink, another 15 minutes to get a menu after asking for one. Annoying wait, they need to hire more people	0
I stopped in for lunch and it was busy-- about 15-20min wait from the time I walked in till I got my order, but let me tell you, it was worth the wait. I had the oyster sandwich, clam chowder, and calamari. The oysters were very tender and I only wished the sandwich had a few more on it, cuz it wasn't very filling. Good thing I had the soup & calamari.. The clam chowder was sinfully delicious, with a heavy cream base and tons of flavor. The calamari was okay, nothing to brag about, but the sandwich and chowder couldn't have been better. \nThe oyster House is split up into two different restaurants next-door to each other.. To the right side is a sitdown restaurant with a bar and the left side is a casual quick stop shop with a counter to order at (which is where I chose to go). The interior is a bit dark & outdated and it doesn't have much of a welcoming atmosphere, but the outdoor tables in Market Square are a great option, weather permitting.	1
Oyster shooters in a plastic cup. Looked a little dirty. Shooters just tasted like ketchup.	0
This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza, and my friend got an Italian hoagie. \n\nOne slice of this pizza, and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay, but the pizza...oh, the horror of the pizza. \n\nAvoid.	0
Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.	0
This place is awful.  The pizza is not good, but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad, they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it, I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone.	0
Unfortunately this dump is right down the street from my hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.	0
"I am really disturbed, tonight I ordered crab ravioli and I have kind of a special cheese culture allergy. Creams totally fine in small doses milk is too) so I ordered to the ravioli and said please no cheese it'll make me very sick.\""\n \""If there's no way to order this without just call me and I'll change my order.\"" \n\nThe pasta came smelling an awful lot like mozzarella) so I called and asked if the guy could check if the order had accidentally had cheese put in it. I mean I get things happen! \""\n\nThe gentleman told me he didn't know what was in the food and I should look it up online.\"" Then he proceeded to say if I was worried I should have someone taste it and snorted when I said I was dining alone. I'm upset and offended. I run my own business... and promote local business's constantly. I will be very sure to let everyone know this Pizza Parma.. believes the customer is not only not right, but their health doesn't matter.  What a bummer. I used to be a big fan."	0
Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.	0
Good for a fast lunch. Had the gyro and added feta. Gyro was fine. Bottle of coke had icy slush in it.	0
"Friendly service, good food and cozy atmosphere. Open late so best place to stop by and get some delicious snacks. 20\"" hoagie is the bomb:)"	1
Update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best.  So disappointing, we loved it the first time!  My guess is that if you get pizza right out of the oven you're good to go - otherwise, you're SOL.	0
"Strolling through Pridefest the other day we became very hungry. It was hot and crowded and we wanted to strand away from the main event for a little and get a good slice of pizza for a good price.\n\nThe atmopshere is very \""dive-y pizza joint-y.\"" Nothing wrong with that because I come from the beliefs that the divey-er the better! (Nobody makes chicken fingers and fries like a greasy bar!) There are some tables for sit-in, but nothing is top of the line. It was comfortable to get away from the crowds and escape the heat for a little with only one other table dining inside as well. \n\nI got the lunch deal which was a personal pan pizza (one topping of your choice) and a bottle of pop for about $7-$8. Not bad! The pizza tasted great, was at a good temperature and had that good amount of grease that I was anticipating from a downtown pizza shop. \n\nService was great as well! The man working the counter acknowledged us from the moment we walked through the door and was nothing but kind. He answered all of our questions and was very polite."	1
"Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \""the best pizza in the city.\""  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow."	0
Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me	0
Pizza is delicious chicken ranchero is one of the best pizzas i have ever had and they have a deal where u get xl specialty pizza with free sub or wings deff a must try	1
I got delivery and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but it was over done for my liking and colder than I expected. It still tasted good so I popped it in the oven and that helped enough to be able to enjoy it. They forgot my drink when they made the delivery but the driver went back and got my drink and returned in under 10 minutes. That alone is why I'm giving it 4 stars because being a delivery driver myself in the past, I understand how easy it can be to forget something small and when you're really busy so it's hard to be quick with bringing the missing items while keeping up with other orders. I will definitely order again just because of the service from their driver.	1
If you can find the place... Avoid it.\n\nIt's a tiny hole in the wall of a bar; which is acceptable, considering I live in Chicago and tight bars are our specialty.  I went with friends to see our friend Lola perform in her drag show of the evening.  It was fun enough as money and props flew around the bar's open floor 'stage' area.\n\nHad it not been for the somewhat under attentive bartenders and the overwhelming amount of cigarette smoke I would have had myself a fantastic time.\n\nNot being a smoker and living in a city where smoking is prohibited in bar and within 15 feet of a public building; I must say... It made me appreciate the Chicago law even more so.  If I were management; I'd figure out how to give your smokers appropriate areas to enjoy their death sticks, away from those of us who'd rather not die as a result of their desire to do so.\n\nIf you're looking for a good night out, somewhere you can let loose and enjoy yourself... You may want to venture somewhere else.	0
A great neighborhood bar in the strip with authentic tasting Irish pub food. I'm a fan of going early (though it's so empty and lonely looking early in the day) for a brunch of bangers, rashers, and mash. Inventive cocktails, and events (on their calendar) are some high points. The bathrooms stick out in your mind though, because they're down some narrow stairs and seemingly so far away they might as well be in a different building. And they may be.	1
Horrible staff! Terrible attitude and we could tell didn't want to be there.  Screwed up our bill and was visible aggravated and angry when we questioned charges.  This awful service makes us never want to return.	0
Have you guys been here in the daylight? This place is filthy! \nI understand this place is old, but wash the curtains (they look like they've been in a flood) and those glass lamps hanging from the ceiling. The woodwork and floor are sticky. \nWe had a Guinness (in the wrong glass I must add) and didn't have the stomach to eat anything. \nAll this place needs is a good wash. Let me know when, we'll go back.	0
Excellent atmosphere and friendly service.   Food was great.	1
For the first time in my life, I sent my meal back to the kitchen. The Corn Beef in the Corn Beef and Cabbage tasted really bad and felt like I was chewing gum. Avoid that plate at all costs	0
This is the most authentic Irish Pub you will find.   The food is good and plentiful and the beer selection is impressive.  I have been several times to the Ceili  dances on Tuesday night, they are a lot of fun, and the regulars are great about reaching out to teach newcomers. There's lots of live music, and a truly Irish ambiance.	1
"There's a reason why this place has no reviews.  It's never open...not even at 6:30 pm on a Thursday.  Even though the sign said \""Open\"" and the door was open.  I guess I was supposed to know that it was closed.  But all I got was two people screaming in my ear that it was closed like I barely understood or something.  So much for customer service.  Needless to say, I probably won't be back."	0
This is a very odd restaurant.  I was here once and probably won't be back.  The people who work here were doing a lot of screaming at each other, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant but our food took about 45 minutes to come, and the quality of the food wasn't that great.  You can definitely get better Vietnamese elsewhere in the city.\n\nWith all the wonderful dining options in the Strip, I'm confused as to how this place survives.	0
Uggh.  I wanted pho really bad, but theirs tastes like warm ramen broth with 4 little pieces of meat in it.  Got the fried spring rolls, too, and they charged $5-6 for four little rolls that were obviously prepackaged frozen spring rolls.\n\nI gotta stop trying out restaurants without checking Yelp first, because everyone else is dead on.  Avoid this place unless you're in the Strip and absolutely have to have some Vietnamese (and don't care too much about quality).	0
So here's my story, I went into  this branch of Burlington Coat factory on a Saturday morning when I was in town for a conference. It was 10:15 and I had to be at a panel at 10:30 (so I was in a hurry). I needed to get a pair of jeans because  the ones I had packed were damaged. I found what I was looking for and as I left the dressing room (wearing the item-which I have done at other stores--with no problem), I told the woman that I would pay at the register (keep in mind that I am the only person in the store). \n\nSHE WAS AGAST! She couldn't believe that I said that. She said that I absolutely had to pay for the jeans before I could wear them. Keep in mind that I've been on travel and had to wear clothes out of the store before and have paid for them and HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS.\n\nI FEEL LIKE SHE TREATED ME LIKE A CRIMINAL. I was deeply \ninsulted. \n\nI remember now why I don't go to Burlington Coat Factory.	0
I love this store. It is always busy and it is kinda ghetto but on a positive note the layout of the store is pretty ok because I still find amazing deals.:)	1
I. Love. Burlington! \n\nI love the deals and their stylish clothes on the low (!) &  how you can go in looking for anything from a hair accessory to a new set of bakeware and they'll have it!\n\nYesterday I bought a lunch tote that was $7.. i searched reviews for it on Amazon and it was listed at $25.. on Amazon which already knocks off prices.. Seriously a steal!\n\nThey even have Pirate shirts. I went in to look for one before a game & they're cheaper than I can find from the street vendors. (no sense in paying $20 for a shirt i most likely wont wear outside PNC park)\n\nYes, it does have some off the rocker customers, but you'll have that downtown at an off-price store..	1
I used to really like this place, but the service can't be overlooked anymore.  I ate here recently on a monday afternoon (granted it's not the A team on Monday's), but  it was so obvious the staff just wanted to get us out of there so they could go back to reading star magazine.  The food was good, not great but good enough.  The service as mentioned was poor.  The server was apathetic at best.  He didn't give us time to finish our soup before he had our entree's in front of us and a check on the table.  I think this was my last visit.	0
This place does decent Thai food, but is nothing special. There was nothing memorable or notable about my meal. The service was decent. This is one of few places in downtown Pittsburgh where a vegan can go and be reasonably accommodated.	0
The food is the reason to go. Lunch specials are a great deal- about 9-10 bucks for lemongrass soup (spicy broth with cilantro, mushrooms and tomatoes), a spring roll and entree. I would recommend either the red or green curry as both are spicy, flavorful and contain meat and tons of fresh veggies. The pad thai is decent and for those that do not like thai food, there is a chinese menu on the back that my friends contend has been general tso's than the authentic chinese places close by.	1
terrible service is right.  the minute my coworker and i walked in, the host (i think the teenage son of the owner?) was just rude.  he was going to give us the table closest to the register where people are always walking in and out.  my coworker asked to be seated at one of the other 8 tables that were open.  he mumbled something, but then let us grab another table.  and when he served the dishes he pretty much was throwing them onto the table.\n\nthe wonton soup was horrible.  the wonton itself was pretty much all dough (not even cooked all the way thru) and i don't even want to speculate what the tiny meat in it was made of.  i've also tried the house soup which is just water with tomotoes in it.  for my entree i had the green curry w/chicken, which actually wasn't as bad as the service but that's not saying much at all.\n\nsad that this is one of the few places for asian food in the pitts...	0
Pass.  I tried Lemon Grass for takeout and was as disappointed as many of my fellow Yelpers here.  The Pad Thai was bland and generic, and tasted almost gummy.  The coconut lemon grass soup had slightly more flavor, but it left a really greasy feeling in my mouth.  \n\nTo top it all off, while I was waiting for my food, I had to endure being hit on by the host.  To be fair, it's not like they were all that busy, so I guess it gave him something to do.  And I wouldn't have minded if the food had been amazing.  But sadly, it wasn't.  And it wasn't cheap, either.	0
Waiter was awful and food (pad thai) was not much better. Apparently letting the waiter know that your soda is flat (twice) is a huge inconvenience to him.	0
This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to. The servers are rude and slow, and the food is awful. Everything pretty much looks and tastes the same. The waiter seemed annoyed that my eating partner complained that his soda was flat, and brought him another flat soda. When he complained again, the waiter told him to see the host on the way out.  If you are in the area, there are many better choices for a good meal, other than this place.	0
Just had the panang tofu for lunch, and was crazy underwhelmed.  Tiny portion, very watery sauce, and just no *zing* at all to the flavor.  The wait staff was slammed by a half-full restaurant, so things like a coke took ten or fifteen minutes.\n\nThis trip was bad, even for the price.	0
Stay away!!!!!! The waiters/waitresses hate you and your hapiness.	0
Poor service, awful attitudes and sub-par food.  I could make the same food in my own kitchen ... Hope to see another Thai spot open downtown.	0
Oh this place needs Gordon Ramsay, Friendly staff, but something is missing I don't know what? \n\nFood was ok, but not fab. I was a little disappointed with the Panang curry which didn't look like what I know it should look or tasted like. \n\nThai tea was no bueno.	0
"I looked over the other reviews and I don't get it.  Maybe they've suddenly gotten better.  I moved to Pittsburgh about four months ago, so I only have recent experience to go by, and I think this place is great.  Would they rate as well if they were in New York or San Francisco? Maybe not, but this is damned good Thai food.\n\nI've eaten outside (dinner) and gone for takeout - both were excellent.  I like really hot food and usually end up disappointed.  Some places just throw a bunch of pepper in so it taste's peppery rather than having heat.  Last night I got a red curry with chicken.  I told them \""Thai hot\"" and assured them that I knew what that meant and got a great (and very hot meal).\n\nI am a little baffled by the mix of Chinese with the Thai - I guess the Yinzers in Pittsburgh can't really tell one Asian cuisine from another"	1
This restaurant has never been great, but if you wanted an Asian restaurant in the Cultural District it was an OK place to go. However, last night's dinner was just plain bad. I had beef salad, and it was some coolish beef on iceberg lettuce with sliced onions and a totally forgetful sauce. Nothing like the mix of sweet, sour, and spice that it should have. I also had tofu panang. It was also virtually tasteless. Some coconut milk flavoring in otherwise nondescript brown sauce with no spiciness.	0
A very lovely name for a very terrible resturant. \n\nThe food is bland, bland bland. How this place can serve such flavorless food and stay open for years is beyond me. \n\nThe inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained. \n\nI decided  to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce. The sauce was slimy and the broccoli was water logged and over cooked.  As if it has set in a pot of luck warm water for hours before being served to me. \n\nI'm noticing a theme of horrible resturants on 6th Street and I don't like it.	0
Don't waste your time or money. Rude service, and pizza was subpar.  So many better options right around. Please dont cut corners on quality of your product.   The bar looked small and quaint. ..maybe the beer is really cold or I just hit a bad day.  For pizza? Na ...won't be back! NEXT!!!	0
"This Starbucks is worthy of mention only because it moved into the lobby of the former Plaza Theater.  The Plaza is where my friends and I (legally) first saw R-rated movies on our own.  I remember seeing \""Pulp Fiction\"" here.\n\nOtherwise, it's just a Starbucks."	0
i go here because it's close and because i like sweetened iced coffee black.  also because i hate crazy mocha and there lack of making a simple sugar to sweeten iced drinks.  truthfully, i wouldn't go here if jeet was open at normal coffee hours.  why?  bad staff...well, one staff member in particular .the woman in front of me in line totally polite to her. me totally opposite. rude .big attitude and not even a thanks. i really don't care one way or the other about your sexuality but don't take it out on me because im a guy.	0
"I will start to say... The owner is not so much of a nice guy, the establishment could use some updating, the bathroom is Disgusting(!), Garfield is not an uplifting environment (women, do NOT walk alone here at night) those are the negatives offhand.  The good is that some obscure independent bands play here for a relatively inexpensive price, the sound is adequate the \""artwork\"" SUCKS! go see a show here & just be overwhelmingly WOWed!"	0
"This thrift store has a truly community friendly atmosphere. It is a smallish store and volunteers are always setting new items out from boxes newly donated. \n\nI have always gotten a good deal here in a time when \""thrift\"" stores can be overpriced for kitschy or unique items. A bag of books is always 1 dollar no matter how big or small the bag. There is also a furniture store next store which they need to show you into because it is often locked.\n\nGood place for cheap stuff."	1
The staff was all very nice and it was a very laid-back place. It was quite small though. Good for clothing, but not really any furniture or large housewares items. A small area with dishes, glasses, etc and then electronics which was mostly VHS tapes and cassettes. They have a nice-sized children's area in the back with clothing and toys.\n\nThis seems like the kind of place you might find a gem occasionally, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here since there are a lot of other places with a much larger selection.	0
I ate china house for dinner. I had the shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce combo that came with pork fried rice and an egg roll. I substituted steamed rice for the fried rice. I also got wonton soup (small). The price was great! For all of that and a can if sprite I paid 10.17! And the service was prompt and the lady in the front was very pleasant! Bottom line is the garlic sauce on the shrimp and broccoli was not good at all! It was very thick to the pony of sticky. It was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice. I could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross. The portion size was nice. The wonton soup was fine. Basically I will most likely give this place one more chance with a different item on the menu because of its proximity to my house and the great customer service. Hope I have better luck next time!	0
i just ate half of a cockroach.  Gross.  Never going here again.	0
Every time I have been to Cafe Sam I have been very disappointed.  On my most recent visit, the waiter was overbearing, the menu confusing, and the food unremarkable.  Avoid this place.	0
Gotta say, I'm not a fan of this place. The prices were very high for the quality of food. Not that the food was bad, but it wasn't great, and for the price it certainly wasn't good enough. The wait staff was nice, and was attentive, but would forget things and made our bill ( true it was a party of 10) a freaking nightmare. 2 waitresses recording their own bill, so two bills with everyone's items on both bills just randomly. Confusing, and a pain. The place it self is nice, but when the food isn't very good and way over priced, and the bar is SUPER over priced what's the point?	0
Cafe Sam has a cool Pittsburgh vibe. It's a bit funky but the food is good and interesting and their menu offers a lot of choices. I went with a group and we all had the Prix Fixe menu. It was a little bit pricey, but I think it was well worth it.	1
"Not great. Stale bread and the food was strongly over-flavored. I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another, and I said \""just a half glass\"" which I ask for all the time (and get). The reply from the waitress was \""we can't do that\"" and the same from the manager. CAN'T do that? Terrible attitude - more like WON'T do that. Well, I WON'T be going back"	0
Great flavor, nice ambiance, and delightful evening.	1
Huge menu, reasonably price, extremely mediocre food, with a nice plate of chocolate chip cookies with your bill.  I ate here when it first opened 20 years ago and it was good back then.  But over the years it has gone down hill.  Way down hill.  I won't go back.  It kind of reminds me of food you'd eat at when you are stuck in an airport.	0
The restaurant has a nice setting and pleasant decor, but the food is seriously lacking.  I always know it's going to be trouble when the menu is excessively long... that says to me that the restaurant does many things, but really nothing well.  And that's exactly what I got at Cafe Sam.  I had a pulled pork sandwhich that was bland, dry, and not particularly well put together.  My girlfriend had a similarly bland meal.  It was fine for lunch while we killed time waiting on the dealership to finish working on her car, but I won't be back by choice.  Toast!  down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch.	0
Great experience. Staff was quite attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Allowed us to sample a couple appetizers. Most of the items we had for dinner (appetizers, entrees and dessert)	1
I was totally blown away by our Mother's Day meal at Cafe Sam.  The dishes were creative and well presented.  The prices were very reasonable for the quality.  Our waitress, Corrin was delightful and smart and friendly and lovely.  The menu was as good as it gets.  I wanted to tear a page out and hand it to the waitress and ask her to bring me this.   A great value, plenty of parking.  Why would anybody go to the Olive Garden or Red Lobster.  This was better and cheaper.  Next visit to Pittsburgh, I'll be back.	1
The restaurant operates out of a renovated brothel...my brother and I dined at the bar...which had various house infused liquors...(maple whiskey...peppercorn vodka...cherry vodka...pickled gin... Dirty vodka..others)..we ordered the buffalo chicken medallions for appetizer...which were at best average ...my top shelf long island was average....food delivery was slow and the bartender was occupied for a whoke before taking our order...the bathrooms are dated....it seems like this restaurant is catered to 50+...the dining hall was not busy but our appetizer took nearly 20 minutes to come out and our entree over 30 minutes..my snapper was average on a bed of collard greens.  ..whipped sweet potatoes average again and creamed kake was definitely average.  ..the host brought out complimentary marinated mushrooms which were pretty good after our dinner...our dessert was chocolate cake a la mode..which was a cold cake with a small scoop of strawberry ice cream on the side.  The chocolate cake again at best average...the bill came to 90 with my brother ordering the cod and a beer. I had a Bailey's on ice which was probably the best thing I ordered...	0
My boyfriend and I had dinner here tonight and it was amazing! I read that it was hard to get seated so we made a reservation. We were seated as soon as we arrived. It was not very crowded at all but that could have been because it was late. We had the ahi tuna tartar and Italian sausage for our appetizers. My boyfriend had the porterhouse with parsley potatoes which came with a vinegar base slaw and baked apples. I had the filet with pasta which came with the same slaw and apples. We also had the pear tart for dessert... Everything we had was delicious!! I would recommend giving this place a try for sure. It will likely become our Friday night date spot! :)	1
One of the first things I did when I had a little free time after moving to PIttsburgh was to locate a good CD store.  Paul's definitely fits the bill.  A small but extremely orderly (re: alphabetized!) shop.  I knew what I was looking for, otherwise I could have spent an hour browsing.  Genre sections are clearly labeled and easy to find.  Right when you walk in, you'll find a rack of the newest releases on your right hand side.  \n\nAfter I had acquired my bounty of Wolf Parade and Stephen Malkmus discs, it was time for the final test... having a chat with the staff.  The experience was good - they are friendly and very knowledgeable, and I can look forward to asking them for recommendations.	1
One of the great independent record stores, Karl Hendricks runs his business just like he plays: with passion and creativity.	1
"Paddy cake bakery is a step up from the typical grocery store bakery but not by far. While many of the pastries are \""good\"" I haven't had anything from this bakery that really called me back for more. One might say there is a \""richness\"" lacking in ingredients.\n\nMany of the pastries are average price 75 cents to $1.50 for individual pastries with some items on sale for a $1 and I suspect these sale items might be a cheap, risk free way for you to acquaint yourself with this bake shop. I've visited Paddy Cake on 3 occasions.  Once had small cookies with chocolate icing centers (can't remember the name), once a creme filled Pizzelle ( icing too sweet and not rich enough for me), and once a cupcake that tasted just like the very cheap ones you might find in the grocery.\n\nTo be sure this place is a bit of a Bloomfield icon, and you might enjoy the bake shop charm is has to offer. It is to be noted that this location is not for sitting and eating or loitering. It's simply a shop to drop into and satiate the sweet tooth."	0
"Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night screaming, \""I NEED TO GO TO PADDY CAKE BAKERY\"". Okay, that may be a lie, but if you've been here you'd know why I'm saying this.\n\nAs much as I love the newfangled bakeries such as Vanilla and the now defunked Dozen, to me, there is nothing like a good old fashioned take a number type of bakery. Paddy Cake is located on Liberty Avenue near West Penn Hospital. If you blink you'd miss it which leaves more cookies for me.\n\nIt's hard to describe the desserts with any other adjective other than delicious. I hate to sound corny and easy to please but the thumbprints are to die for. Everything I've bought there has been better than I anticipated. Donuts- amazing. Cookies- wonderful. Pastries- Delicious. I think you get the point. I feel like I come with a ten dollar bill, leave with money and have a bag full of goodies. The money will soon be spent on milk to wash these puppies down."	1
"After meeting with several bakeries that want to \""rape your wallet\"" with crazy charges on wedding cakes, we met Susie from Paddy Cake.  She is absolutely fantastic - willing to listen to all of your crazy ideas and the prices at Paddy Cake are very reasonable.  The cake is also FABULOUS - seriously, the best white almond cake that I have ever tasted.  Not being able to wait until the wedding, we've actually ordered small cakes for every occasion preceding the event because the cake is just that good.  I highly recommend this bakery to anyone!  From the giant lady locks (seriously, the size of your face) to the freaking phenomenal wedding cakes, this place has it all."	1
Recently was in the Bloomfield area and thought I would stop by for a donut.  I ordered a long john which looked pretty good.  Unfortunately it wasn't.   I am pretty sure they simply took a hot dog bun and fried it, then put icing on top.  I ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker.  So many great bakeries in Pittsburgh so I would not go back.	0
I was skeptical about going to a typical pizza shop during a food tour in Bloomfield, but boy was I wrong. This pizza is really good and you can tell that they do not pick the cheap ingredients off of the shelf. The dough was perfect (cooked well, but kinda doughy) and the cheese was excellent.	1
"The large pizza is huge. Don't underestimate it.\n\nBe sure to try the \""Angelo's Special\"" sandwich with the homemade mayo sauce."	1
Sad to say, this wasn't the pie in the sky I was looking for. It all comes down to the crust--I threw it out. That should never happen. The crust wasn't enough like the bread from la gourmandine--if that bakery made pizza with the cheese (and even the sauce) from Angelos...now THAT could have some potential. So...still shopping around for a delivery and for a crust that bubbles up around the edges. It might have to do with the water or kneading or something?	0
I order frame Angelo's regularly .Quality in going downhill.First I waited on hold for 10min ,so I drive over and I'm still on hold,I go in there's one person inside and no orders ..WTF am I holding for .?...So my order is $30+ and I asked for a ranch and of course I have to pay for it ?Then I get my white pizza home and it looks like it was in a tornado,this seems to be happening more often..and delivery don't get me started.My rating is PISS POOR!!!	0
"Honestly, the hoagies are fantastic, but their service is appalling. I ordered two hoagies and received one and a half. After calling and explaining the situation, Aaron, the \""manager\"", rationalized that their hoagies are large and could send another half \""depends on how hungry you are\"". ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I have never in my life heard of such asinine customer service. The girl on the phone was really nice though...if that counts for anything. They just lost a loyal customer...never again."	0
Best Pizza Shop in Bloomfield. Hands down one of the best Sicilian Pizzas around! Sicilian Cuts and Cheese Fries are my go to every time I dine here! Plus they sell Turner's Tea!	1
While I was a little skeptical walking into the place, I loved the experience in the end.  EVERYTHING you need, or could possibly ever think of needing is there in the shop, in multiples.  If you don't know what you're looking for, or how to fix it, Gerry will help you.  As will the 6 other bike fanatics who are in the shop working on their own bikes.  The prices can't be beat.  And, while you have to do the work yourself, it's really rewarding to walk out of there with a bike you fixed yourself.  Same repairs at REI or Dick's would have been two to three times as much.  Would definitely go back for more!	1
The best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  6 stars for the pizza, n/a for the other food, 4-star decent beer selection for the size of the place, 2 star for the prices, 5 stars for the owner, 2 stars for the employees/service, 5 stars for timeliness. When it comes down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home. It's that good. Don't be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta!	1
Lived in a number of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and finding that locations best pizza is always a challenge.  I have followed friends advice, magazine reviews, etc., etc. with mixed success.  Having moved to Stanton Hts. I was at a loss, but driving around Bloomfield, the first one to catch my eye was Graziano's. A great mix of locals, students and employees from Children's Hospital.  The pizza was great.  Somewhat thin crust, baked bubbly and crispy around the edges, can use more sauce but the mix of cheeses quickly remedies that shortage.  Toppings are great.  Makes a great breakfast the next day outta the fridge!!\nThe beer selection is admirable.  The service varies depending on who is at the counter.\nSince discovering Graziano's I have been up and down Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield and always return to Graziano's.  The only other place to get my business would be Aiello's in Squirrel Hill.	1
I ordered a Veggie Pizza with 4 different toppings and did not really enjoy it a lot. They use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza. Also, the toppings were not greatly blended, just rather sprinkled. DIdn't even enjoy the pizza crust.\nI work right next door, but wont go there again.\nI usually dont write reviews. Was surprised Yelp had 4 stars and I was disaoopinted, so writing my experience.So sharing my input that may help others make an uinformed choice causeI think 4 stars is misleading.	0
Service was quick. Barbers are friendly and experienced. I was in and out in 15, and only paid 10 bucks. I strongly recommend them!	1
Old fashioned barber shop. Been doing business here for years. Good, fast, cheap.	1
Really cheap, & really quick! As mentioned before, the barbers do listen to you & cut your hair just the way you ask them. \n\nOnly drawback, if you see it as such, is that they specialize  in just traditional cuts (buzz cut, crew cut, etc). Nothing too edgy or crazy\n\nThis is a cash only place, so don't forget the $10!	1
Read some reviews and decided to try them out. Im very pleased with the haircut and even more pleased with the price. Walked right in, no wait, asked for what i wanted and they delivered. Will be returning!	1
I appreciate this joint very much.  An amazing deal at 10 bucks (plus a few for tip). i can't quite get my hair exactly to the way I like it, mainly because I can't quite describe how I actually expect the final product to be, but they do a great job with my vague descriptions. this, and they get the haircut done in around 10 minutes.  even when there are three people ahead of me, I'm not worried about spending too much of my time waiting.	1
Just went there for the first time today, very nice barbers and great price! Would recommend them to everyone!	1
Last barber on the left was who helped me. Very nice but not very skilled. He uses plastic guards for his shears and also I noticed after washing my hair I have very thin parts that were cut much shorter than the rest of my hair. Luckily my hair grows fast. I trusted Yelp! reviews but they let me down. I may try one of the other barbers with real shears once more but I am hesitant to recommend or go back here with  confidence.	0
OMG , I Found one of the VERY BEST Hot Sausage WITH CHEESE sandwiches that I have EVER tasted. Pizza Italia is a wonderful small business ( and I LOVE Small Buz ! ) You should check with your cardiologist before ordering these fine delicacies. This is a great balance of fine Italian hot sausage with onions and souses.  They even speak Italian to each other !\n\nPizza-hut can burn in hell ! This is how it should be done !!!\nAlso , The Prices are very reasonable.	1
You want pizza? You'll getta pizza. It's good. Definitely my go-to for price and quality, but, despite being my standard, it doesn't have that extra je ne sais quoi that would make a five star slice. By the slice pizzas often sit for awhile, and though a slice is only $1.30, they're only about 30% of a slice wide, so I'd recommend going in for a whole pie.	1
Basic pizza. Pretty solid, not too expensive and open till 11:00 on weeknights. Really not much to complain about.	1
I have only had the lunch buffet, which really isn't fair to write a review off of.  While cheap and I would consider a good deal, it was overall greasy and bland.\n\nOnce I go back and order something off the menu I will have to re-review.	0
I am disappointed.  I have lived in the neighborhood for over 6 years and I keep giving them a second chance (and a third).  The take out menu says in big letter on the front 15% off take out.  So we ordered again, although we generally get poor service and the food is average at best.  \n\nThis time we ordered 2 entrees and and a few sides.  When I went to pick up the order they had given us 15% off ONE ENTREE.  So it was no discount at all.  When you mention something to them about poorly worded menu and the principle of false advertising they argue with you.  \n\nSo we are done with them, no more peoples we will drive down to Taste of India from now on.	0
Way better than India Garden. The interior isnt that great, but the food more than makes up for it. The buffet is a great price and you get a good selection.	1
Delicious food and reasonably priced, especially if you go during there happy hours!	1
"I've ordered for delivery a few times.  Although you get small portions for the price..the food is pretty good.  This time I and a coworker ordered 2 seperate dishes that came with rice.  They combined the rice in one container.  Why?  My coworker leaves in 10 mins with my rice....ugh!  Called the restaurant and all I get is a ...\""wellll..I don't know what I can do?\""   Are you serious?"	0
I just wrote a bad review so I want to counter it with a good one. People's Restaurant easily wins the top slot on Kelly G's list of the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. The restaurant itself is small and no-frills (Indian shabby chic, you might call it), but they have a big table in the middle suitable for large parties. Their lunch buffet is smaller than India Garden's but slightly more delicious. Greg B. and I get take out, add a bottle of wine, and have romantic dinner parties-for-two on our front porch. Perfection.	1
"I would write a \""0\"" review if I could. I cannot review the food. I did not get a chance to eat there. Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food, during one of the \""Unblurred\"" Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully, and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No \""reserved\"" signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up. \n\nWhether or not he was prick or or a racist prick, I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield, so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble, who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat, we do not? \n\nWith the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers, I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating."	0
I've been hearing how great people's is from friends, so decided to check them out. I went for the lunch buffet. I arrived around 1pm when it ends at 2:30pm. There was still fresh food on the buffet. They refilled while I was there. As a vegan I appreciate Indian food & had many options. Usually my gauge for any Indian place it the Chana masala, my favorite dish. I was super impressed with theirs. Perfectly steamed  chickpeas with right amount of spice & cilantro! A second favorite was the Aloo Pang which is spinach potatoes & spices. The nan was fresh & hot. Also, the service was great, I never once had to ask for water. \n\nFor my second experience with people's I decided to order take out. They do free delivery to the surrounding area! (I live in Stanton Heights) it came within an hour of calling & was freshly made. I had no complaints. I order Chana Masala, Aloo pang & nan....it was about $20, lasted me dinner & lunch the next day ! Plan to\nOrder again soon	1
The lunch buffet on Saturday is great hangover food.  it is cheap, hot, refreshed often, and has the standard selection.  I love going here.	1
At first glance I wasn't too impressed with the buffet, I thought it'd be another botched attempt of authentic Indian food. While the selection is not that impressive, I would say that the quality is pretty damn good. \nI debated for a long time with my friend about the food going back and forth between a 3 and a 4. I ended up going with the 4 due to the Indian tea that they had - hard to find at any buffet!. \nThey aren't trying to wow you with exotic ingredients or fun twists, it's almost as if you're sitting down at someone's house and eating what they'd eat on a regular basis. Plus you're paying around 9 dollars for a buffet, I mean- let's get real. You get what you pay for.	1
Hadn't been here in a few years and remembered I enjoyed it in undergrad, especially for late night half off. Called in advance to make sure they were open until 10 and had half off like they used to. The woman who answered the phone said yes to both so I rushed over. The portions were small, but I assumed it was because it was half price so I shrugged it off. The tomato sauce was chunky and generic, the raita side dish was 4 spoonfuls big, and the chutney dips were cold and bland. Assuming this was due to the discount, I didn't complain. Receive my check to find out it was all full price. Despite the woman telling me on the phone that it was half off, it was buy one get one half off. The woman on the phone was the same as the hostess. She admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake. I don't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous. A subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing. Never going back despite the fond memories I had accumulated when in school. Completely ridiculous.	0
I take back everything I said in a previous post (about all Indian restaurants tasting the same and that it all tastes like something out of a box)!!\n\nI was so completely wrong! \n\nPeople's is amazing and fresh, vegetarian friendly, pleasant staff, warm and inviting.	1
Went here for dinner twice in 1 week when I was craving Indian food. The food is pretty good compared to other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Also, it's BYOB with no corkage charge. The service is also great. Just took off one star for the naan- it was a little burnt each time I came here.	1
Very expensive and quantity was quite less. I am an Indian and I love Indian food but their food gave me hard time in digestion; I suffered for 2 days. \n\nPrice-wise too, I wound't order again when I can have whole buffet at Tamarind at less than half price. I ordered chicken curry, the one at Coriander Restaurant on Murray Ave is yummy but this one was so-so in taste, mostly disappointing. I also ordered Samosa, I find the poorly fried samosas of Bombay Mart better than these ones. Then I ordered tikki (aloo patty), really disappointed, it looked several weeks old reheated in microwave. I know from 24 years of experience how fresh tikki tastes like. \n\nI like Indian restaurants in this order: Uddupi, Tamarind, Coriander, Indian Carts at Pitt, even Yuva India and All India more than this one. But definitely it's better than Prince of India, where food smells like 2 week old and there is absolutely no taste in the food.	0
This is closer to home-cooked Indian food than your average Indian restaurant. The lunch buffet is yummy. The chai is absolutely delicious!\n\nI am there almost every weekend for their lunch buffet. Yes, it is that good!	1
"My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night. I had been to the lunch buffet and it has always been alright. However, the dinner experience was wonderful.\n\nWe both got combo meals, he the chicken curry and I the fish curry. The fish in the curry was salmon, which was a little unusual and not quite as good as other fish you could curry, but I was also made aware of that when I ordered. For the price we both left very full. The waitstaff was very helpful. When I ordered a \""10\"" on the spicy scale, he asked if I wanted \""American 10\"" or \""Indian 10\"". After finding out that \""American 10\"" = \""Indian 5\"", I was steered toward the \""Indian 7\"" which really was perfect for me. (In previous trips, we had both thought the food a touch mild, but knowing there was an Indian heat scale fixed that problem right off).\n\nIt was a wonderful dinner, and I can't wait for our next trip!"	1
Maybe I went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible. The spring rolls were falling apart and only filled with noodles and a couple of sad looking shrimp, no thai basil or mint leaves or cilantro to speak of. I also got some crispy noodles with seafood which I only ate because I had been sitting on a train for 9 hours and was starving. And the whole thing was seriously overpriced for Pittsburgh, New York prices for extremely subpar vietnamese, meh.	0
So I am currently sitting here with Pho Minh's Pho tai...and I honestly have to say I am not impressed.  Its a monday and my favorite Pho place (Tram's...in pittsburgh anyway) is closed.\n\nI decided to give this place a go...and take out their pho...\n\nThe broth is actually good, very light yet flavorful.  But the noodles are a disgrace.  They are lumpy, smooshy and not at all chewy...they just kind of dissolve once you put it in your mouth, and they take up none of the broth's flavor.  I also ordered some fresh shrimp spring rolls that were halfway falling apart when I got them, and barely any shrimp.\n\nAll in all, I'll come back if im desperate for Pho on a Monday, but otherwise...nay	0
No way, dudes. Go down the street and get some tastier food at Tram's Kitchen. The grub is better, the restaurant itself is a little cleaner (not saying much on either account), and the water even tastes better. \n\nReally. I'm not joking about the water.	0
"I absolutely LOVE noodle soups.  From cold winter nights to a late night snack in the summer, a big bowl of pho always hits the spot (as does ramen or beef noodle soup, but that'll be for other reviews).\n\nPho Minh serves up pho with debatably the most fragrant beef broth in Pittsburgh.  Their pho also always comes with sliced rare beef, which is sometimes cooked well done at other pho places (COUGH TRAM's KITCHEN COUGH).  Also, they do some of the \""unique\"" parts such as tripe, which I am a fan of.\n\nService is reasonably fast, the atmosphere is reasonably dingy in a comforting homey way, and the food is tasty.  Yes, if I want some fresh spring rolls (Gi cun), I'll probably head to Tram's, but when I want pho, I want no nonsense pho, and Pho Minh is the place to be.\n\nOn a sidenote; their other dishes are pretty good too, but for me I'm heading to Pho Minh for their pho."	1
when tram's is out of the equation, this is my backup. just as good.	1
I had my second bowl of pho in Pittsburgh here, and although it was better than my first bowl, it was still pretty disappointing.  The broth is everything for pho.  Pho broth takes like nine hours to make.  The broth at Pho Minh is bland and almost clear in color.  Good broth should be dark and pungent, not like watered down chicken broth.  I had the combination beef with tripe pho, and there was literally about five small pieces of beef in there.  I guess since there is not much competition here for Vietnamese food, the $8 price tag is valid, even though that's much more than what I normally pay for good pho elsewhere.\n\nWe also ordered the deep fried spring rolls, and that was a disappointment too.  Mine was also still cold in the center, so I can only guess that they are frozen beforehand.	0
This is my favorite type of restaurant, regardless of cuisine; namely, a family run institution with great food, friendly service and an almost complete disinterest in spiffing up the surroundings. Yes, Pho Minh is a bit divey, and I relish this quality. The pho is great, as are all of the dishes I've tried here. I also have a deep appreciation for restaurants that do one cuisine and do it well...none of this Thai/Vietnamese/Japanese combo that only serves to confuse the diner as well as, often, the kitchen. Between this place and Tram's down the street, Pho Minh is my favorite. Pittsburgh has a woeful dearth of good restaurants...I'll try not to go on too much about that in my reviews, as I don't want your eyes to glaze over...so this is a destination restaurant for us. There are very few things more satisfying than a deep bowl of pho on a cold winter day.	1
"Tram's has better *ahem* \""atmosphere\"".  Pho Minh has better Pho."	1
"I just graduated from CMU and the thing that I miss most about Pittsburgh is Pho Minh.  Their pho is unbelievable and their #4 (pork spring roll) is equally as amazing.  Moreover, Pho Minh completely trumps Tram's Kitchen.\n\nI took my parents here for my \""last meal\"" before leaving the City and they loved it, too.  They aren't into 'ethnic food' at all.  That being said, I would take ANYONE here.  Their grilled chicken (#30 something) is perfect for people who dislike pho.  \n\nIt's a must if you're anywhere near Pittsburgh."	1
The last review I read said Tram's has better atmosphere. Funny that I ended up at Pho Minh for the second time because Trams had kitchen violations and was shut down. Both times , the food was perfect. We started with the spring rolls, served cold with a nutty fish sauce - deelish. We then ordered the rice pancakes, which were loaded with shrimp and tofu. Lettuce cilantro and basil on the side, all fresh and graciously served. I tried spicy beef over lemongrass. The spice and citrus were a perfect combination. The portions are plentiful and all the entrees were priced under 9$. Highly recommended. One tip-they only take cash. Love this place and hope to add it to the regular rotation of Pgh dining!	1
"Once I learned that Dr. Bebko charged twice as much as The Humane Society, I stopped taking my cat to the Cat Clinic. If you only need an annual examination and shots, go to The Humane Scoiety (and make a donation!). If you have an emergency, go to the VCA Castle Shannon Animal Hospital. For everything else, try the Cat Clinic. A day before a recent trip, my cat began behaving erratically. Because I live near the Cat Clinic and they had a same-day appointment available, I went there. I waited 40 minutes past my appointment time and I didn't appreciate Dr. Bebko's \""doom and gloom\"" comments. I won't be returning if I can help it."	0
"I brought my sick kitty here who was vomitting and had diahhrea for a few days and the Dr we saw was like \""so what do you want to do\"" and I was thinking well thats why I am here to ask for your professional advise. I felt like I spent $100 for absolutely nothing. I would not recommend this clinic for any legit issues, I am sure they are fine for a vaccination or routine check up but I would never allow them to treat one my sick babies. I had taken my lil girl to the AVETS clinic over the holiday and they stabilized her and asked us to F/U with a primary Vet (clearly something significant was going on), the visit I had was a total sham I felt it was useless and I found a new Vet to care for my lil ones."	0
Living near Groceria Italiana is like having my Italian family nearby.  Easy access to excellent food.  Homemade pasta, sauce, desserts, etc.\n\nTheir ready to eat food is delicious.  There is no reason a meatball sub should be a weekly part of my diet - but I can't help myself.  \n\nEveryone that works there is so helpful.  I've had a few parties catered by them - and they were overwhelmingly gracious.  \n\nI highly recommend stopping in this place to grab dinner - either for ready made food or their pasta and sauce.  You're about 10 minutes away from deliciousness.	1
It's a nice small and authentic market that's just one block off the main strip. I absolutely love this place! If you come at the right time, you'll be able to see the fresh ravioli being made right in front of you.	1
I consider myself a lucky girl to live in Pittsburgh's own Little Italy (although it has taken it's toll on my waist line, truth be told). Two separate and delicious family owned Italian grocery stores and countless amazing restaurants.\n\nGroceria Italiana is one of those quintessential corner stores that make you think of the way things may have been when your parents were young.\n\nIf you're one of those on the go-doing a million things at once types who rarely find the time to cook a meal, look no further than the hot food options they offer. It's that perfect delicious comfort food that these up coming autumn days.\n\nSkip out of work early and make a pit stop here on your way home, you'll thank me later.	1
I had such high hopes. And though they clearly pride themselves in their pasta and ravioli, mine fell apart like crazy. It was a mess. An expensive mess. Artichoke and Gorgonzola everywhere. Not only the seams fell apart. The pasta broke all over. I may go back for tiramisu in time, but I'll definitely hesitate before spending 9 bucks on a dozen pieces of watery mess again.	0
Years ago I discovered this quaint grocer and their awesome lunch counter. The meatball hoagie and weeding soup are seriously are amazing and authentic. I have not had better wedding soup in the city. I'm also in love with the homemade raviolis, (read the directions, these are baked not boiled.) My favorite is the artichoke gorgonzola, they are often sold out. If you're lucky enough, you'll get a chance to see the raviolis being made in action by one of the lovely pasta making ladies. Make certain to use the homemade sauce as well, we're talking heavenly good. Also, if you get there early enough, grab a warm, fresh Tuscan bread, (but maybe I shouldn't be telling you this.) it's crispy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. I dream of this bread. The deli counter is as well fantastic, get some meats and cheeses and have a banging sandwich. Anything you try from here is sure to keep you coming back for more!	1
Love the fish sandwiches, they are all they are cracked up to be.  If you want lunch - try a sandwich here - but order ahead for pick up, or be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more in a shady looking bar.  The bar is very smoky, although it is also stocked with a soda machine if you get thirsty waiting for your sandwich to be made.   Although for a fish sandwich and fries you'll probably drop about $10, I think its definitely worth it.	1
I walked in to try the fish sandwich that I have heard so much about but decided not to stay. The smell of smoke is over powering.  If your not a chain smoker, opt for takeout.	0
The bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky. You'll definitely feel like you're in the deepest hole in the way. The only good thing is that the drinks are cheap. But I really wouldn't recommend going there.	0
Yes, the fish was good. However, the restaurant was dirty, the bathroom smelled so awful that I could not go in it. The waitress was RUDE, CRUDE, and downright  OBNOXIOUS!!!!  Was the fish good enough for me to ever go back - NEVER!!!!!!!!	0
Sandwich lives up to the hype! The cornmeal breading is phenomenal and it isn't greasy like some others.\n\nAs of 07/2014 food service stops at 7 PM on Friday. The sign looks like the one pictured but with a giant black 7 over the kitchen closing hour for Friday so I'd guess all the other hours are the same (I didn't take a very good look as I was focused on the deliciousness before me).	1
Friendly, kind staff and good service.  I'll go here again and again, for eat-in or take-out.  I don't really have any favorites here...everything is tasty!	1
Love this place. And they have coupons too. The bonus is definitely the amount of food, you get enough for delicious lunch leftovers!	1
Tried the vegetarian thali ($12ish) and was really impressed by the quality, variety, and spiciness to order.  Will head back here with a smile.	1
I had high hopes for Taste of India, after reading the reviews, but I was not impressed. The food did not taste fresh (I had pakoras and an eggplant dish) and the rice was definitely old and crisp from sitting in the bottom of the cooker. I asked for spicy and my dish was quite mild. We were there toward the end of the night and the staff seemed resentful of our presence. As much as I love Indian food, I'll probably give Taste of India one more chance sometime, earlier in the evening. I hope to report back with at least one additional star.	0
"5:30pm, worst Baingan Bartha I've ever had. Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \""8\"" really pop with flavor."	0
Food from the motherland is a weakness of mine so despite good feedback from some friends, I tried to resist coming here when I first moved to Lawrenceville. So much for that!\n\nTaste of India is flat out great. Prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is simple and tastefully done (unlike another restaurant in Oakland, cough cough).\n\nThe staff are courteous and accommodating. I called out for take-out one night and when I walked up to the restaurant, I found that they had mixed up my order and I'd have to wait a few more minutes. As an apology for waiting, they threw in free samosas! (btw, the samosas here are delicious). Rest assured, this isn't a regular occurrence; the next time I ordered from here, the order was promptly ready.\n\nThe tandoori is very good. The chicken tikka masala is nice and creamy with good flavor. The palak paneer is also delicious. My taste buds are very happy to have found good Indian take-out within the city limits. (My waist-line is NOT pleased).	1
Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around.	1
This was my first time at taste of India. The service was very pleasant and I found the food and alcoholic beverages to be quite inexpensive. Most importantly, the food was fantastic. The flavors were well balanced and succulent. I will definitely be coming around more often.	1
It was more expensive than other Indian places I've been to, but it was good!  We did takeout and they gave us a ton of rice and I order way too much naan.  It was $65 for four of us.  \n I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and I loved it, my wife got the Chicken Curry, also very good.  The other couple got a shrimp dish and a tilapia dish, which I tried but didn't care for.  I would never have ordered those dishes anyway so I won't count that against them.\nI would like to try lunch here - I saw a buffet table, so that might be a more cost efficient choice for this place.	1
Buffet, while small is totally worth it. Has all the essentials!	1
If you really know and like Indian cuisine then food here gonna be flavorless and bland for you. Tandoori chicken doesn't taste like one etc. Decor is tasteless and old. Carpet looks really dirty. I'm definitely not coming back.	0
Not fancy but great Indian food at a really reasonable price. The eggplant was particularly yummy.	1
I would have to say that this is some of the best Indian I've had in pittsburgh so far. The staff were friendly and attentive. \n\nThe chicken korma was delicious. It had almonds and raisins in it, which complemented the sauce nicely. \n\nThe check comes in a tray with candy coated fennel seeds. We didn't know it was edible until our server said to try some. I liked it because I like black licorice. Also, our server explained that it helps to cleanse the palette after a spicy meal. \n\nThe prices were on point. The seats and tables were new and comfortable.	1
This place is awesome.  He was closed but was still there cleaning and took me in for a great old school cut.  I'd tried some salons and was relying on Sueprcuts a lot and hadn't been to a barber in quite some time.  Sure, I haven't had this kind of haircut since gradeschool, but he did clean it up quite nicely and even gave my beard a clean trim.  Definitely recommended if this is what you're looking for.  Also, some great conversation	1
I was desperately in need of a hair cut. Generally I had went to Hair friends in Oakland, who are great for styling hair in  a particular fashion , but quite pricey. I wanted a shorter, neat cut, and this shop was open. \n\nThe gentleman was very affable, and the atmosphere was pleasant. As others have stated, he does a very thorough, and quick hair cut. This is not Supercuts, folks, he knows how to cut hair. \n\nFunny guy too, I will return.	1
I called in to see if I could squeeze an appointment in on the day of the call. He said he was pretty busy, but that I could swing by at 4:30pm. This place is a one-man-shop with two barber chairs, and I knew that going in. I'm pretty sure that he knows all of his repeat customers. I found out about this place from a friend who said that the guy who runs it is awesome, and the person getting his hair cut before I arrived was busy in good conversation when I arrived.\n\nAnyways, the hair cut was nice, what I wanted, quick, and $14, so not bad. I know nothing about cutting hair, but this guy undoubtedly has a technique he has honed. At the end, instead of using an electric razor to shave the back of my neck, he used a straight razor with warm shaving cream.\n\nI'm going to keep coming to this place because I like the traditional feel and the familiar atmosphere.	1
Great conversationalist, inexpensive and high quality hair cuts, wonderful old school atmosphere. No computers, no expensive hair products they're trying to hawk, just a man doing his craft. Every time I go there I'm so happy this place is still thriving.	1
My husband comes here to get his hair and beard trimmed. I am always happy with the result. that simple. :)\n\nA couple of times I have accompanied him to the Golden Razor and have always found Tom to be accommodating, very friendly, efficient and professional. He is also so kind to my daughter - who loves to go with daddy to get his hair cut. \n\nI could not recommend him enough. My husband always has a great experience there and holds a very high opinion of Tom.  \n\nHe takes appointments and even though the man is very busy he will try to accommodate walk-ins but I would suggest you call ahead first.	1
I'm a pretty hard core karaoke fan, so I was excited to visit Nico's on a Saturday night after hearing about their awesome karaoke. Sadly, I was disappointed. The place is rather small and was packed by the time we came (about 10pm). It took ages to get a drink and it's hard to get around the bar with so many people standing around. That said, my drink was nice and strong and the prices are reasonable. \n\nNow the karaoke crowd was pretty fun...mostly hipsters with a few good singers but mostly people trying to be funny with their song choice. The karaoke host was just lame. He was an older guy, and seemed rather cranky and jaded, which really kills the mood when you're a karaoke buff looking for a good time. And he had a CD setup -- seriously, CDs, in 2010. His song list was waaaaaay out of date. He had a tiny TV screen that was setup in such a way that if you needed to look at the words, you would be facing away from the crowd. It was just really lackluster in my opinion.	0
This will be simple...\nThe karaoke had a very limited selection. \nThe DJ kept fiddling with the volume while you were singing. \nWas way over-crowded with wanna-be hipsters who were attempting to be ironic which just made them look pathetic, especially since they kept taking pictures to most likely show Facebook people how much fun they were having and how great they are.\nThere was only one server for a bar packed with people and was hard to get a drink.\n\nWon't be going back.	0
Bloomfield has some hidden gems and Nico's is one of those kind of places that is getting less and less common around the 'burgh. It's not a gastropub, it's not bohemian, Nico's is just an old time bar/restaurant that makes me nostalgic for a time before I was even born. \n\nI always come here on Monday nights for the wing special. It's something like 24 wings for 8 bucks which is not a bad deal. There are definitely better wings around the city, but I still keep coming back to Nico's. Maybe it has to do with the friendly atmosphere (seems to be a family run place), and the divey feel. The location is great as it just pops up in the middle of a residential section in the heart of Bloomfield.\n\nThe patrons are always friendly, and on more than one occasion I've had random people start chatting me up like we've known each other for years. If you are feeling adventurous try out karaoke night on Saturdays, its always good for some laughs and fun times.\n\nLong live the old school joints in Pittsburgh, I hope you last forever.	1
"This is a friendly, hipsters-and-yinzers-living-in-harmony kind of joint. Sports on the TVs, Yeungling on tap--quintessential Pittsburgh. The fried fish (with fries and coleslaw) is Lenten-Catholic quality. If I minded cigarette smoke, this place would be a four; but since I don't, perfect score. Like Scorpion once intoned...\""Get over here!\"""	1
Pay attention to the bill.\n\nCurly haired male bartender intentionally added $20 of drinks to my tab. When I confronted him he blamed the extra drinks on my friends who hadn't been drinking those things in the first place.	0
I don't understand why people love this place. I've been here a dozen times.\n\nThe beer selection is decent. The prices are good.  The bar food is typical.\n\nIt is just a standard bar to me.  If you want no frills beer and bar food, they are no frills.	0
Favorite local bar! The service is great, owner is on top of everything and her staff is always helpful and friendly. Great karaoke on Saturday nights, Pirates game specials and Meatloaf of Tuesdays is to die for!	1
I was walking my small granddaughter (not yet two) and when I passed I decided to go in to pick up some shrimp for my son.  I waited quite a bit of time in line for the shrimp, then again to check out.  When I checked out the woman at the register told me that they did not accept cards for purchases under $5 and since I had no money with me I told her I couldn't get the shrimp.  THERE IS NO SIGN ON THE DOOR STATING THIS OR I WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED MY TIME OR MY GRANDCHILD'S IMPATIENCE GETTING THE PRODUCT.  PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR SO PEOPLE CAN EITHER PASS BY YOUR STORE OR GO TO THE BANK ATM PRIOR TO ENTERING.  I will not be back (the woman was rude).  I have been there before, making much larger purchases, but never have been aware of the restriction.  PUT A SIGN ON YOUR DOOR WHEN THERE ARE STORE CONDITIONS I LOOKED FOR ONE ON ENTERING.  Restrictions are understandable, just not when you fail to publish them and I waste my time.	0
"I *used* to think Donatelli's was a great place--they're incredibly cheap, the premade foods like crab raviolis are delicious, and they have awesome chocolate covered pretzels and biscotti.\nThen I saw one of the deli members drop meat on the floor, pick it up, and stick it right back in the case! Also, a whole tray of meatballs and sauce from the hot bar was spilled all over the floor. They just scooped it right back in and I only hope it wasn't served! The place smells awful and the workers are grumpy. There's a lady there who's always screaming and cursing and some fat guy that's just as bad. The LAST experience I had with Donatelli's was when I bought a tub of \""freshly packed\"" soynuts. I got home, cracked a brew, and reached into my beer snack to find a WORM!!! If you value your health as I do, do not eat anything from Donatelli's that  was packed there."	0
Jane is so right. The food and prices may be great, but who wants to eat dirt with it? I've seen someone mop the filthy snow tracked floor then put the bucket of water on the deli counter. No thanks. I'll pay a little more for sanitation. There are other Italian grocery stores close by.	0
Whenever I'm in Bloomfield, I've gotta stop in at Donatelli's.  Okay, Donatelli's was my primary reason for going to Bloomfield the other day.  I had to pick up a few of the usual staples.  Our fridge was getting mighty low on mozzarella, provolone, and Italian lunch meats (the salami was on special, BTW!).  Ditto for our pantry--It was getting a little shy on the fine imported pastas, biscottis, etc.  Gotta restock!	1
Yet another review for Donatelli's?  \n\nWell let's take a look at the January specials.  Imported Polish ham for $3.99 lb.  Polish ham at an Italian store?  Okay!  Fresh homemade pasta for $2.49 lb!  Gonna be having some veal tortellini with spicy Italian sausage and my homemade marinara sauce for dinner tonight.  Nicholas coffee for $6.99 lib.  We all know that Susan doesn't resume the form of a human female until she's had that 2nd cup.	1
After visiting Donatelli's today as part of a Yelp Event, my husband and I returned to purchase Cheese Ravioli, Grandma's Plain Sauce, and Chocolate-Covered Almond Biscotti for dinner. After having tried all three this evening, I can definitely recommend Donatelli's food and look forward to having these items again!	1
I RUSHED to tan today after work. I got to Yolanda's at 7:20PM, only to find that the salon was closed. Both the sign on the door and the listed hours on the website state that Yolanda's tanning side is open until 8pm. I'm pretty pissed that I wasted time driving the whole way from Monroeville to Bloomfield for nothing. I've spent money on (multiple) tanning packages here, but I will definitely be taking my sad, untanned booty somewhere more reliable from now on.	0
If you wanna see local color, come to D'Amicos. If you wanna get a stiff drink in the middle of the afternoon while walking around with a bandage on your face and wanna fly under the radar (true story), come to D'Amico's. This place is absolutely no bells or whistles, the waitresses are loud, and the stale sent of grease and old liquor hangs in the air. All the way down to the cracked teal vinyl seats, this place is legit.  \n\nD'Amico's just don't give a s**t.\n\nBut it's all good. Having traveled quite a bit, I often find placees like this refreshing. The Wedding Soup is comforting and they are generous with the bread. And....they have no judgements about the previously mentioned strong drink that I consumed at 2:37pm on a Friday afternoon.	0
I live right around the corner, so I've been here a couple times. The atmosphere is local, and the service is friendly and attentive. What wins this place 5*s  is the food - some of the best italian food I've ever had! Pasta, gnocci... even the salads have been delicious. The bar is beautiful as well. It looks very old but in a good way. I was so surprised by this place - it's one of those Bloomfield gems that I was very happy to discover.	1
Damicos has been closed since December 2012	0
Hole in the wall - check.  Stern (at times) owner who rules his roost - check.\n\nI don't really trust a Vitnamese restaurant to be really really good unless it is a hole in the wall kind of place.   :)  And this place is good.  Now, my one beef with this restaurant is the limited menu.  But really, they do everything on the menu so well that you can't really complain.  And the prices are extremely reasonable.  Make sure you get the fresh rolls.  I usually get the vermicelli with a little bit of everything on top.  And unless you are ridiculously hungry, get the smaller bowl - it is still a lot of food.\n\nBYOB, so feel free to bring your own alcohol of choice.  I can't remember what the corkage fee is, probably because there is none, I believe.  And bring cash.	1
Like the owner. Informal atmosphere- almost Asian cafeteria style except the food is really good. Decor is a little disjointed. Cheap prices so I'm not complaining. Always fast service. Good place for a casual hang out w/ friends or a not-out-to-impress date. Do not add fish sauce to stuff- it almost ruined my Tram's proclivity forever.\n\nGood place to get a spicy hot soup in the winter if you're cold.\n\nSeems good for large groups. Cash only I think...	1
The first thing that charmed me about Tram's kitchen was the tablecloths. They are exactly like the tablecloths I saw in a little hole-in-the-wall restaurants throughout Vietnam. The decor is very similar to what you'd get in Vietnam, so if you don't like the decor, you probably should never go to Vietnam. \n\nIn terms of food, the service was quick, the food was piping hot and quite delicious. I was expecting more fresh herbs on the pho, but the complex broth more than made up for any lackings. \n\nI will definitely be heading back to this cheap, tasty hole-in-the wall.	1
Cheap, tasty, filling.  We tried the pho, spring rolls, and lemongrass chicken; all were well worth ordering again.  This was, however, my first Vietnamese meal, so my thoughts are necessarily less discerning.  \n\nThe owner is indeed a character, and he more or less ordered for one of us.  Luckily, we're pretty easy going, and generally happy to take a proprietor's advice on what's good.  He struck me as amusing and endearing rather than abrasive.\n\nThe place was packed, though we went at 7 on a Friday.  Given this and the fact that they take no reservations, it'd probably be a hassle to go there with parties larger than 4.	1
Great pho and fresh spring rolls!	1
great place.  great food.  perfect spice level and it doesn't interfere with the flavor.  had an everything bowl with vermicelli and some egg rolls.  very good.  quick for lunch too.   excellent pricing.  cant wait to eat here again.	1
If you have been to any other PHO restaurant, in any other city, Tram's Kitchen would be OUT OF BUSINESS! \n\nFor starters, the portion of the PHO is extremely SKIMPY! I don't think we have had such a small portion of PHO since we were Babies! Seriously, would it kill you to add more rice noodles? \n\nSince we had the PHO as our Appetizers, we then ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles...Oh wait...we paid for Seafood...but all we got were vegetables and some imitation they call seafood. What a Joke! \n\nSuggestion if you plan on going here. Come FULL and just order the Spring Roll.	0
This place isn't much to look at, but when the I'm talking about a restaurant ambiance falls second to good food. The pho here is great. Really flavorful with a great balance of ingredients. I need to go back and try the Bun.	1
stop 4 on our 7 state pho tour - and everything else you read is true.\n\nmy thoughts were like this...\nsmall, border line clean, authentic, no tripe?, took forever to get food on the table, excellent pho, nice little place.	1
I'm Vietnamese and I grew up eating Vietnamese food everyday.  Let me tell you, this place is a big let down.  I don't know why people are giving it such rave reviews.  All my Viet friends in this city also avoid this place because it really is NOT good.  \n\nThe portions are tiny, and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied.  It lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have.  I've had pho at home and in 30+ different pho restaurants and this was probably in my top 5 most disappointing.  As for the other dishes, it comes to the table looking like someone already ate it or like a jumbled mess.\n\nThis is aside from the service..I actually like the old man that works there...he's the only reason I give it two stars.	0
They have the best Pho (I get the vegetarian version), vegetarian spring rolls and tofu w lemongrass. Those are the only things I order there bc they are so delicious I can't bare to order anything else.  It's not the best atmosphere, but the food is delicious.. and that's what you go to a restaurant for!!	1
"Visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and wanted some Vietnamese so we stopped by here expecting to find the best pho in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant. The menu is small with very limited choices. Service is minimal. \n\nWe ordered some spring roll appetizer which was pretty good. Then we had 3 different kind of pho for our main entree. We ordered a \""sate\"" soup, a Saigon soup and a pho Hanoi soup. Only decent one was the pho Hanoi soup which isn't really like the typical pho. No beef tripe, tendon or beef balls in the soup and the noodles are fatter then what you'd find in typical pho. There was also excessive MSG in the soup dishes."	0
awesome vermicelli with coconut milk. if i lived around here i would eat at tram's every day. actually, i live in san francisco, which (obviously) has excellent restaurants, many of them vietnamese. i would put tram's up against any of them, any day of the week.	1
I've been to Tram's several times, always hoping for a better experience, and more importantly, better food.  I eventually gave up.  The food tends to be bland, the owner brusque, and with Pho Minh just up the street, I find myself going there when I'm craving a hot bowl of pho on a cold Pittsburgh winter night.\n\nFood highlights - \n   None that I can really think of.  The food is cheap.\n\nFood cons - \n   The component that makes or breaks a bowl of pho is the broth.  It is the one thing that must be good for the soup to be enjoyable.  I've never had any hint of real flavor from the broth itself (before you add the plum sauce and the srirachia and basil and lime).  This is something that Tram's has gotten badly wrong every time I visited.	0
Although everyone comes here for the pho, i also like the fried rice and the egg noodles with tofu yummy! yummy!	1
I don't know how other reviewers compare Trams to Pho Minh.  Pho Minh is disgusting and uses a very tasteless powder broth/soup base for their pho.  Pho Minh is a lot closer to the real deal, but their pho selection is really small.\n\nThis has been the best bowl of pho I've had in Pittsburgh, and the four stars is totally relative for the 'burgh.	1
Trams has Vietnamese food and it's in Pittsburgh.  So if you're craving spring rolls with peanut sauce or vermicelli with fish sauce and fresh herbs, this is the place to go if you're in Pittsburgh.  Be forewarned - if you've had Vietnamese food from places with large Vietnamese populations, Trams satisfies an urge but it's definitely not the greatest.  They're stingy with the herbs and the peanut sauce; a bit on the expensive side for this kind of food (especially for being such a dive); the pork is dry; and the vermicelli bowls are pre-mixed - even the fish sauce has already been dumped in.	0
I am from Houston, since I came here I've been searching for the perfect bowl of pho. I have to say this is the closest thing yet from home!!! Good pho with fair pricing, doesn't get ebtter than this.	1
"Darren and I came here last weekend, and I liked it very much. The \""Saigon Soup\"" was sssoooooo goood! I couldn't finish it! The portion was so generous. I also liked their egg rolls and the sauce that came with them. The owner was nice to us but doesn't play around! You have to order fast because the place is always full! I appreciated how he found a table and some chairs to seat us even though they were superbusy. I love Asian food, and now I have another place to enjoy.\n\nI didn't mind the decor, and the place isn't \""dirty\"" either. What do people expect? The Le Mont?"	1
I don't see the hype. Bad service, bland food.	0
Went here last weekend with friends. Two of us became violently ill with food poisoning. Ordinarily, I would recommend the spring rolls and the pho, of course, but since my trip to the ER, I won't be back here again.	0
Don't believe the hype.\n\nWas in the Pittsburgh area for one day and decided to try the pho here.  It was a toss up between Pho Minh and here.  I think I chose wrong.\n\nA rule of thumb is a good ethnic restaurant will be swarming with that particular ethnic people.  When I went, all I saw were non-Asians.  \n\nOrdered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable. It did not taste flavorful and authentic but maybe that's what is available in Pittsburgh.\n\nAnother sour note, they dropped off some spring rolls at our table.  It was our first time there and I thought they were complimentary so we ate them.\n\nLater on, we saw them on our bill.  WE DIDN'T EVEN ORDER THEM.\n\nThey were overpriced, and not worth it.\n\nBe careful if they drop off food or drinks at your table, they will bill you for it afterwards even if you didn't order it.	0
This is one of the best secrets of Pittsburgh. By far the best Pho in the area and over many places I have visited. If you want good service & environment, you'd better stop here. It's a hole in the wall by a seemingly angry asian (he's actually quite nice). Expect to wait on water or wait on refills. If you make your order too complicated, it'll probably get messed up.\n\nWith that, the Pho. It's amazing and I've had a lot of Pho. However, it has it hit and miss days too. The meatball is more tender and flavorful than the beef which can be dry or tough to some that haven't had Pho before. I wouldn't recommend any other versions. A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.\n\nSpring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly full of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only. There's an ATM at the entrance or any of the nearby gas stations.	1
The food here was awesome.  Get some	1
I really want to give this place more stars but the food at Pho Van is so much better. Tram's Kitchen tastes like home cooking, and it also feels like home with the owner's kids running around. \n\nBut the bun thit nuong (pork vermicelli) was pretty sub-par, even with my already low expectations for a Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh (we're Vietnamese from Cali so our expectations are usually really high!). The pork was so dry and tough it was inedible for me (though the bf ate all of his). The egg rolls were okay but just not the kind I'd sell at a restaurant. The spring rolls were edible yet I have to say the worst I've had (even I make way better ones). \n\nThe waiter/owner(?) is really sweet, and I feel a bit guilty for not supporting the restaurant but I'm sure those that love this place will keep it going strong. I'll try this place once more and hope to give it a better review next time!	0
My favorite pho resturant in town the fresh rolls are great the pho is very tasty.  The prices are good and the food is great.	1
if you're going out to vietnamese for the food, go here. if you're going out for the ambiance, go somewhere else. when you walk into tram's, you'll be seated and handed menus and approximately 45 seconds later be asked if you're ready to order yet. the staff is pretty get-in-get-out-get-going style. it is byob though, which is pretty cool too.\ni ordered the beef pho soup. i really enjoyed it. like i said, if you're going for the food itself, you should definitely check this place out, it's pretty damn good.	1
GREAT FOOD!  Like the other reviews - you will not be disappointed by the fresh spring rolls.  Best I've had in the city.  The only part of our experience I wish I cloud have changed was the ordering process.  We weren't really sure what any of the dish's were, and the server offered no clarification.  My boyfriend was so flustered he just ordered by number and ended up with two entrees!  It was pretty funny.  Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  We will definitely be going back (with a bit more knowledge of the menu)!	1
If you can get past its humble appearance, Tram's Kitchen has the best pho and fresh spring rolls in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe restaurant, which is owned and operated by a family of Vietnamese immigrants that left the old country in the early 1990s, is very down to earth and low key.\n\nThe service is primarily provided by Tram's father, who has one hand but somehow manages to seat, take your order, pour/refill your water, brings your food, clear the table and cash you out. He can be moody at times, but I have never found him to be rude even on a bad or busy day (he probably just doesn't have time for slowpokes who can't make up their mind). I would cut him some slack if he doesn't appear to be the most patient person in the world. \n\nParking in Lawrenceville can be iffy at times, but if you drive west a few blocks past Tram's there are usually many streetside spots. Cash only. BYOB.	1
1.5 / 5 - Beef Pho: Kind of bland tasting\n2.0 / 5 - Pork Chop: Not much meat and as much flavor as I'm used to, but still good.	0
Being Vietnamese I've had tried tons of Vietnamese Pho restaurants and Tram's has to be one of the worse place I've ever been to. The food was mediocre and full of MSG. I ordered a rice vermicelli dish with egg rolls and they were oily and greasy. The Pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty. \n\nMy total bill doesn't reflect the price of the dishes I ordered. My bill came out to be higher than what's listed on the menu. Maybe because I'm vietnamese and being a visitor to Pittsburg for the first time, they think is ok to overprice their dishes on a Sunday night. \n\nAlthough the old man at the place is nice, this place doesn't deserve the stars that's given. I don't recommend this place to anyone especially my Vietnamese comrades whom may visit to Pittsburg looking for good authentic home town cooking.	0
Location:4050 Penn Ave Pittsburgh\nPrice: $ 1/2\nService: Good\n\nMy family was really hungry and everywhere my parents visit they always want to try native food. So, I search Viet restaurant on the GPS and it lead us there- I mean if it was apart of the GPS' top 10 it must be good. I feel like being Vietnamese made me more critical on the food when I do go to Vietnamese restaurants. \n\nIt is in a residental neighbourhood downtown.You're able to park along the streets. It was a very humble environment and very cute. The service was okay, they were really nice and never rude. \n\nWe ordered Pho (of course...), com tam, pad thai, and bun. It all tasted plain;the Pho was a little off, the pad thai wasn't spicy or had enough of the sweet/sour taste to it. The portions were really small. I definitely feel like my GPS lied to me and that I've experienced better.	0
Love the Hanoi Pho and spring roll. Nice plump shrimp too. Do yourself a favor...it's far from a fashion spot, just real good eats. Reminds of what SF's Tenderloin excellent Cambodian and Vietnamese were back before everything cost an arm n a leg.	1
The best Vietnamese I have tried in Pittsburgh. The Tufu lemon from the appetizers was just perfect. I found the place from Yelp.com and I would definitely recommend it! Very inexpensive too! I really like it!	1
It's about 2.5. We live in Squirrel Hill with a lot of good restaurants and I thought this place is better than where we usually go. The pho is the cheapest in Pittsburgh but the portion is very small. The spring roll is the most expensive vietnamese spring roll. \nI ordered the Saigon soup for myself and #17 for my husband. My husband likes it because he is an america and like sweet stuff. Everything with coconut is good for him. These dishes we got doesn't look like what they showed on the photo. The Vietnamese place in Squirrel hill or the stripe is a lot better.	0
This is my go-to place for Pho. I normally get take out since I live in the area, but sitting here is quite an experience too. This is authentic Vietnamese food. \n\nHighly recommend to anyone looking for some good Pho.	1
"First of all, Tram's has been cited by the Allegheny Health Department for code violations like not storing meat at proper temperatures. I also personally know several people who have gotten violently ill from eating there. If that's not enough to stop you, read on.\n\nI feel like people who like this place are confusing \""dirty & mean\"" with authentic. The staff are unpleasant and it doesn't feel like a place you'd want someone cooking food. \n\nAnd finally, sure, all of this could be different if the food was good, but in my opinion, it is not. Bland and disappointing, the Pho most of all. Pittsburgh has so many great asian restaurants, including other Vietnamese options, that I don't see any reason to eat here."	0
For starters I had a fresh spring roll and a fried egg roll. The fresh spring roll is big and stuffed with shrimp, shredded pork, lettuce, basil, and rice. It was probably a sixth of the size of a chipotle burrito. The fried egg roll is a little smaller, yet it is still packed. I enjoyed the fried egg roll way more, but I wouldn't discourage someone from trying Tram's fresh spring roll.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Vermicelli noodles with coconut milk and beef. It was sweet and savory, but it missed a kick of spiciness to counter the coconut milk. I asked the staff for crushed red chili pepper flakes, but there was a significant language barrier which impeded me from conveying my request. Eventually, I said pepper enough, and I was brought jalape\u00f1o peppers. Not quite what I was looking for but they were an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe only subpar point of the night was the difficulty with service. The cash only policy could have been trouble; luckily, I read some reviews beforehand which prepared me. Also note that Tram's lets you BYOB.	1
Delicious.  Side benefit:  cheap.  We got the pork chop split rice and the pork sate pho.  Both were good.  Service is prompt and efficient. Cash only.	1
I came here awhile ago and ordered one of the rice-based dishes with chicken (can't remember exactly what it was, and there's no menu posted online for me to figure it out).  The dish was dry and lacked flavor.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish here, since the Pho seems to be what they're known for.  As it were, I wasn't impressed. I don't remember anything being off about the service, so it must have been fine.  If a dining partner specifically wanted to try Vietnamese, I'd come back and try the Pho, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, given that there are many better dining options on Butler St.	0
I was born and raised eating Pho and this honestly was the blandest I've had. Then, to mask the bland no taste of the soup, it was smothered in black pepper. On top of that, my meatballs were quite dry, even in soup.\n\nHowever, their spring rolls were great!\n\nThe service, was not the best. We were seated and then grunted at (literally) to take our order. From there, people who were seated after us, had their food before we did. They had a very similar order to ours. Then, when I did receive my food, the man hovered near me and then started pouring sauce onto my plate, telling me how to make my pho. I know how to make it! And even if I did need help, I was barely just given my bowl and getting my bean sprouts in first. Give me a second.\n\nI had high hopes based on the reviews, but unfortunately, I don't see myself coming back here again.	0
I had the fresh spring rolls and the pho, both are great.\n\nConsidering prices of all restaurants in Pitt, the prices here are very nice! For a large pho, it was $7-8. Spring rolls were $1.50 each.\n\nThings to note: cash only\n\nAlso, you can get the pho with beef, chicken, or meatballs. You get a nice portion, but the pho does not include tripe, tendon, flank, and other random meats you'd normally get with your pho elsewhere. \n\nBesides this, broth was excellent and portion/taste was great.	1
I love this place.  The vermicelli is amazing.  It is a cozy hole in the wall.  The food is so good.  And it's BYOB.	1
Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you've been doing!  Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries, and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger!  A great place to be drunk in, not so great to be hung over in...  They have your typical greasy spoon fare, so don't go if you're concerned about your health.  Otherwise, eat on brave soul, eat on!	0
I've only been here after 2 AM, and it's always been a flaming trainwreck of an experience.\n\nI've had to figure out if the waitresses were doing this as a halfway house job, I've had staff members not apologize while picking pieces of steel wool and green plastic scrubber out of my food, and I've witnessed an armed robbery.  The food is decent, for the hours they're open.  \n\nTry Tom's Diner or Eat 'n Park instead.  Heck, go to a grocery store instead.	0
A Pittsburgh classic.  Many, many late nights have I spent here, post strike party, or any other type party, eating the grease necessary to fight off the hangover I deserved the next day.  The waitresses are part of the ambiance.  Love their Reuben.	1
Okay, the food isn't wonderful -- but, it's pretty good AND it's cheap! I must admit I always stick with the breakfast-y menu items, but I'm such a fan of this place!\nYou gotta appreciate Ritter's being open 24 hours. Where else in Pittsburgh can you go at 2 AM and get some comfort food (or something to sober you up)? I've been here at all hours of the day, and the crowd is always interesting... and so are the waitresses.  Ah, I love it! There's just something special about Ritter's.	1
"Ritters is, for me, the definition of a diner.  If you go early an old grandmother will serve up a sloppy egg breakfast on plates that you can't be sure if they've been washed more than twice.  Go late night and you can join drunk college kids and \""the ladies of the evening\"", just be warned that someone may have painted a section of the restroom with a fine layer of regergitated food (\""hey, is that creamed corn\"").\n\nSay what you will about Ritters, it is a place full of character and full of characters.  Not to be missed."	1
Quintessential diner complete with in-booth mini-jukeboxes, waitresses in diner aprons and cheap, good, simple food.\n\nGo early, go late, go REAL late - it's ALWAYS open.\n\nLocated on the borders of Shadyside, South Oakland, Friendship and Bloomfield it serves the likes of college students as well as the eldery.\n\nUsed to live around the corner from it and went weekly.	1
The food isn't something to rave about but it's edible. I love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves. I have only been to (C)Ritters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when Pittsburgh's finest come out to play. Never a dull moment.	0
At 2am on a weekend night, the clientele is colorful, the service friendly and the food...well just forget about the food.  The food ranges from mediocre to bland.  Just be grateful there is a colorful place to go for a late night meal.	0
"Worst food in Pittsburgh. That's all. I have been there twice, never my choice, I had tummy ache both times. I think the food is boring. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with non-gourmet food, but Ritter's, is just \""blah\"". It also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around. \nThey are cash only also. That doesn't both me at Pamelas, because the food is oh so delish. Here, you are just wasting you apetite on food that has TONS of rooms for improvement."	0
2.5 but I rounded down.\nThis is not a place you go to eat out but it's rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps 4 in the morning. Cash only. Doesn't separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves.\nI'm not a big fan of diner's and haven't been to one so I don't have anything to compare to but like I said, if you have nowhere else to go you might try this one.\nFood is ok. It's like the food that a mom who doesn't care for cooking cooked. I don't want to be too mean. Waitresses are friendly. They are dressed up in scrubs like nurses.	0
"I can't really give a food review since I didn't order anything, but there is a reason why I didn't order anything.\n\nMy brother and his friends had the midnight munchies after the whole pub crawling. Being the responsible little sister, I \""chaperoned\"" the boys and went the Ritters with them. I wasn't in the mood to eat after midnight, but that's not the reason why I didn't order anything. The reason why I didn't get anything was because when we walked in the diner, I looked at the variety of dishes other patrons ordered and felt slightly sick to my stomach. Must've been my inner conscious that the food is bad news and I guessed correctly. My brother had the Arcadian burger and by sunrise, his stomach didn't settle well. Had no desire to eat throughout the day.\n\nTrust your eyes, nose, and instinct. It's most likely right."	0
Although it's called a diner, it's much larger than that.  It's open 24/7 and has a full menu.  Tough to fault, especially with good food.	1
Fantastic service, incredibly inexpensive, surprisingly tasty - that pretty much sums it up. As long as you come here knowing it is a cheap diner and not expecting something different, you will enjoy your experience. I had the spinach and feta omelet with tomato, which came with a side of hashbrowns. Each of these was great.	1
Ritter's will never be a fine dining establishment. It will always be a diner. It will always be a standby. It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.\n\nEveryone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry. Every now and then, I do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it is tasty.	1
The food at Ritter's tastes like I made it at home, and this is not an endorsement.  I had the feta and tomato omelet, and it tasted skunked, like it had just been cooked in a dirty skillet.\n\nIt's a dirty diner with meh food, but it is open 24 hours.  If you're drunk, I bet the foood is great.	0
They don't take credit cards (cash only), but damn do they have some good food! The server we had was funny as hell. It's just a good old fashioned diner that's open 24/7/365, and you can have whatever's on their menu 24/7/365! lol.\n\nEarly one recent morning (still getting caught up on reviews!), I had their fried chicken, and it was excellent. Moist and flaky. I loved the Strawberry Shortcake too. The portions are huge! We didnt find the place to be dirty when we came. They have their own free parking lot and have an ATM inside.	1
This was some of the worst food I've ever had.  If this is someone's idea of nostalgia, nostalgia is a term I'd like to forget, and the reality is more like nausea.  Their greek soup (tasted like Campbell's chicken noodle flavored with lemon) and nasty lamb gyro douched with cucumber dressing will likely haunt me as long as I live.  For anyone looking for a good nostalgic diner experience, i can't make a recommendation because I've yet to experience one, but at least in this case, leave the past where it belongs.	0
After many years of going past this place, I finally had the chance to go in and check out the food! As soon as you enter Ritter's Diner, right there in front of you is an ATM- credit/debit cards are not accepted. The d\u00e9cor is not modern, but it still adds to the diner's charm. The waitresses, who wear hospital scrubs as their uniforms, were friendly, but they seemed rather tired while I was there. Nonetheless, my waitress was attentive and provided efficient service. Ritter's Diner is open 24/7 and whatever is on the menu can be ordered any time of day. So for brunch, I ordered a steak breakfast that came with eggs, home fries and toast. Everything was delicious! I am so pleased with my first experience at Ritters Dinner that I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu!	1
"People call it \""Critters\"" for a reason.\n\nThe two times I've been there I was unhappy.  It's cheap, but the food is also gross and you don't get much of it (thank goodness!).  Very small toast, cold hard pancakes, and adequate dippy eggs was what I received last time I went.  \n\nOh, cash only too."	0
Joyce was a great server. She took great care of our party of 7 and was very personable. \n\nCheap, average diner food. You can have subpar breakfast, lunch or dinner at any time of the day! Best consumed late night when nothing else is open. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here besides a late-night drunk snack.	0
Ummm, we're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here. That was the last thing we had eaten for hours, and the next morning he DEFINITELY had eaten something bad after waking up... yikes.	0
Ummm..... so I will just be upfront and say that the few times I have been here I was at least a few drinks in, but this is an excellent place for cheap diner food and is fortunately open late into the night. I'm from the south, so it is very reminescent of Waffle House- which is awesome. The waitresses are nice and understanding of the state that some people come in at 3 in the morning, and it will always be a place I look to when I need greasy breakfast-type food. The hashbrowns are particularly amazing. From what I remember, it was cash-only, so if you go out make sure to have the moneys on you!	1
Pretty standard Greek diner - omelets, gyros, pastas and burgers with a 1970s look. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the lunch/dinner items (maybe I just haven't found the right items yet), but the breakfast fare is great! No exaggeration, we probably come here once every other weekend. The Greek omelets are delicious, don't let the idea of lettuce in an egg dish scare you off. \n\nAlso it should be said - the waitresses here deserve major praise. They work VERY hard and almost always with a smile, no matter how much they're running around. They're fast, pleasant, and they are always busting their tails in this hectic place. The food is really pretty inexpensive, so 10-20% for a table of two would usually only amount to about $2-4, so my advice is tip the waitresses well - they really deserve it! :)	1
Don't get me wrong, the foods great, but when there's only a handful of booths full it shouldn't take an hour and a half to get breakfast. If you get to the point that you'd rather leave and go to McDonalds just so you can eat something it's too long of a wait.	0
How does this place even stay in business. It's disgusting. The food is crap. Everything is filthy. All the waitresses look like crackheads. They screwed up a club sandwich & fries. How is that even possible?  It deserves negative stars for sucking so badly.	0
We were skeptical to eat here based on the mixed reviews. We can now say we've tried it and we probably won't go back. We were greeted by a hostess who sounded and smelled like she just got done smoking. Instead of escorting us to a seat, she told us which tables to pick and to seat ourselves. I ordered the sirloin of beef with mashed potatoes and my fiance got the steak and eggs. The food was just okay. Our server was friendly and attentive. We were thankful we didn't have one of the other servers, who was clearly dying of pneumonia or bronchitis or something. She was coughing up a lung in front of everyone and sniffling every 5 seconds. She washed her hands a lot, but the hostess did not wash her hands upon returning from smoking outside. Kind of gross if you ask me.	0
What you expect out of a 24 hour diner.  Food can be pretty good, service can be pretty bad.	0
It is definitely an experience. Located in not such a great part of town. Very old. Food is just ok, grease upon grease. Everything came out from the kitchen hot, but looked like it was all cooked in the same grease in the same pan. Waitresses do not make much of an effort. She was more concerned with eating her meal.  Cashier was a breath of fresh air. She was chatty and nice.	0
I took my family of 7 here on sunday 11/9. We arrived at 11AM and by 1:20 we had not received our food. This is after ordering over and hour ago. We noticed the table around us received their food even though they had been seated after us. The waitress was very nice and said she was sorry for the wait several times. I finally asked to see the mgr, who I assume is the owner. He finally came to our table and after I explained the situation to him all he did was said that he really cares about his customers and if he made all his customers wait this way he wouldn't have any customers then he walked away. He did nothing to compensate us for the long wait. I go here because it is convenient for everyone. The food is just so so. Well this will be my last visit. I understand everyone can have a slip up but it is how they handle it to make the customer feel better. Ritters gets a Failing Grade in this category and an OK for the food.	0
Best brunch ever!  You will have better luck getting seated quickly if you arrive by 10am.  They have the best potatoes in the burgh and it's good food that will stick to your ribs!  The service is always quick and friendly.	1
Awesome food and service.  Family owned homemade itAlian food. They way it's suppose to be. Will go again when I'm in Pittsburgh	1
Family friendly! While some reviewers may lament the outdated interiors, a feature that was not missed by me, I will merely say that Lombardozzi proved to be the best venue for our toddler that we have come upon in months. Our server did not know the difference between bolognese and meat sauce, but she brought soup and milk for our toddler faster than you can say pronto! She fawned over our daughter and made us feel comfortable. \n\nAdditionally, the owner and chef both came to our table to talk to us. My husband and I felt like we were eating at a friend's house, and that warmth is a hell of a lot sexier than any atmosphere we've gotten in a swanky Shadyside lounge. \n\nWe ordered simple pasta dishes: linguine and meat sauce, and spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was fresh and al dente; the garnishes were tasteful and classic; the sauces were remarkable. \n\nI recommend this place for the food and congenial service. It would easily get 5 stars if we hadn't sat in the outdated bar.	1
Don't waste your time!\nOh, where should I start..?\nMy family and friends came here for a Sunday lunch. The prices are crazy high (for -cheap- pasta). The menu outside the building and website doesn't match what they show you at the table. One of our guest was the last one to receive his perfectly square cheese ravioli and the filling was still frozen! (You'd think that for a $16 ravioli plate you'd get home made). After they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat. Some had flavorless Chicken Piccata, Fish and Eggplant Parmigiana. The atmosphere didn't help. The only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce. \nI don't understand the big fuzz some make about this restaurant. What a joke!	0
There has been a pile of vomit on there sidewalk for 10 days, For the life of me I cannot believe they havent taken care of this, such a turn off.  Today is 10/3	0
"Best Burger In The Universe.\nI am a burger lover.  People ask me, \""Alli, where can I get the best burger in DC?\"" I tell them that they need to take 270 to Frederick, get on 70 west, get on the PA turnpike, and get off when they're near Pittsburgh.  Ask anyone how to get to Tessaro's - I'm sure they know.\n\nYour burger will be huge, dripping, and will be so juicy that the bottom bun will be a disgusting soggy sponge.  None of that will matter, because you will be in burger heaven, delighting in the freshly ground beef that makes Tessaro's what it is.\n\nThe restaurant itself is barely more than a bar, with mean waitresses and tiny, crammed tables.  No one would probably ever go there (besides the old, crotchety regulars) were it not for the world-famous burgers.  All testament to why you must go. Now."	1
As good as they say. 5 star burger, and not just by Pittsburgh standards. Dry bleu cheese.\n\nSteak salad, spinach salad with steak are also good.  \n\nI used to say this is the only restaurant in Pittsburgh. Good food, professional service, a nice ambiance (a bar with a tin ceiling) and even a bit of view of the street and hills. And alcohol.	1
My first Pittsburgh review!  Believe the hype about Tessaro's; I can't recall eating a better burger than the one I had there last night.  A half-pound of quality beef, crisp bacon, bleu cheese, grilled mushrooms and onions, all served on a fresh-baked bun....well worth $9.50 and the month that mother probably took off my life.  I was also impressed that they actually cooked it to my specification; when I order a rare burger at most places, I usually get medium at best.  Good beers on tap, too.  Tessaro's figures to be a regular destination for me while I'm in the 'burgh.	1
"It's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this place.  But, I feel the need to re-iterate just how great these burgers are.  After a very long night I woke up in my hotel room feeling the effects of the previous night.  Had a friend in from Delaware and he actually suggested we go after seeing it featured on the food network.  We were there before they opened and actually waited for them to unlock the doors.  I had a gourmet burger cooked perfectly.  The meat had a ton of flavor and it was grilled perfectly.  The  hash browns were a nice change than fries and the coleslaw actually tasted great and wasn't just a \""throw away\"" side.  My friend chose a burger with no cheese or condiments just to savor the burger in it's pure form.  True to the hype my friend declared what I'm sure has been spoken many times that this is the \""best burger he's ever had\""."	1
"Tessaro's has some of the finest burgers in the US.  A wonderful \""corner bar\"" kind of atmosphere makes it THE place to take people in from out of town.  Grilled meats and daily seafood specials (try the prawns) are available and also an excellent choice, but the burger is easily the main event.  \n\nThere are a few downsides, it's frequently packed on the weekends, seating can be cramped, and taking a party of more than 4 is damn near impossible.  But I'd still highly recommend it to anyone!"	1
I went here after reading all the great reviews here on yelp. I was not disappointed and I don't believe my companion was either. It was a Friday night around 9 and the place was packed. We got right in and was seated in less than a minute.Our server came right to us for our drink order. We both ended up ordering burgers, I had the BBQ and it was bomb, delicious. O, and they came so fast, I mean  I was expecting a long wait considering I ordered mine Medium Well. Very good all around and the bill was round $40 for 2 burgers and 4 drinks.	1
I have to agree with all the other yelpers, this is a GREAT burger. After reading all the great  yelp reviews,  I took my family, including my out of town mom, for lunch on a Saturday and was not disappointed. I knew from the smell outside of the building that it was gonna be fantastic eats. We were happy with the service also. We had a party of six and did not have to wait. We will go back again and again and again...	1
"If you're looking for the best hamburger in the city, this place is \""it\"".  Go no further.  You won't be disappointed."	1
Putting lamb in your burger is not my idea of 'gourmet' burger. Sure it tastes unique, but there are better ways to skin the cat. Good, but after a couple of times I got VERY tired of the 'unique flavor' of their meat.	0
"I was entirely underwhelmed by the supposed \""best burger\"" in Pittsburgh, as it had been recommended to me.  I guess I was expecting more flavor - some kind of house seasoning or something special, but it was very ordinary.  \n\nIt was quite busy and seemed a little cramped inside.  They seated us near the window facing LIberty, which was great - but the way the seating was arranged, my friend had her back to it.  I generally prefer  tables perpendicular to the window which allow everyone to look out occasionally without craning their neck.\n\nI'm hesitant to go back, because the burger was the best-sounding thing on the menu and it wasn't that great."	0
"I also left here scratching my head after all of the lofty reviews of the place.  Yes, maybe it is a local institution, but it is not worthy of one of the highest yelp ratings for a restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe burger was mildly admirable.  I'll trust their word that they use high quality ground beef, but it's still ground \""beef\"", not ground sirloin or anything.  It was also huge, cumbersome, greasy, expensive and flavorless.  The amount of blue cheese they gave me for 50c was almost a joke, as well.  Wish I would have gotten the steamed broccoli, my \""potato salad\"" was a sea of mayonnaise.\n\nEven given my limited experience of the burger options in Pittsburgh, I would put double-wide grill's burger above these.\n\nNot much for atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind dirty, dark and dingy if it has character."	0
"I've had better burgers at several other Pittsburgh restaurants. I have never eaten anything else on the Tessaro menu--and since it doesn't look very appealing, it's not likely that I will--but the burgers are just OK. The service, in my opinion, is often quite rude. The \""ambiance\"" is loud, dark, dingy and depressing. Sorry, but I just don't get it. For a better hamburger, try the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium, Murray Avenue Grill, or even Five Guys Burgers and Fries."	0
"This place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers.  It may or may not be, and some of the food is actually quite decent- I've had burgers and seafood and chicken and salads over the years.\n\nThe reason why I rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal.  I've always felt like an outsider here, even when we were going once or twice a week for months.  (We live right down the street.)  \n\nThe hosts are terrible - it's like they look right past you if you're not one of their Special Friends and they shoehorn you into tiny and uncomfortable booths while putting smaller parties into comfortable and spacious booths.\n\nI'll go down the street to Lot 17, where the food is better and no one makes you show your \""Member's Card\"" to get seated."	0
OVERHYPED.  I've had better burgers almost everywhere.	0
"Never been treated so poorly\n\nI went with three friends to eat at Tessaro's on a rainy Saturday evening.  I dropped them off while I parked the car.  The hostess  sat them and when she found out I was parking the car, she told them literally to \""GET UP.\""  She said they wouldn't seat them because I wasn't there.  By that time I had arrived at the table  my friends were still in shock by the utter rudeness.  Tessaro's was a Pittsburgh institution that my family had frequented for years.  Our treatment is a disgrace to its reputation"	0
The burger was pretty good but, I've had much better. Tables are really close to each other like others have said. What I really didn't like about this place was the service. We had to flag down our waitress just to get refills. We were rushed through our meals like we weren't wanted! I mean they weren't crowded or anything. There was one other table of people besides us on the dining side and maybe 10 people at the bar. \n\nI should have went to Five Guy's! I would have been much happier!	0
best burger in pittsburgh**.\n\n\n\n________\n** based on taste, price, service and comfortable atmosphere perfect for a casual lunch, or proper dinner.	1
Overrated. No seating until all members if party have arrived...so we awkwardly hovered over empty tables.  The second bummer here was the lack of french fries  - which is borderline criminal when you offer a burger.  The bun was dry, the burger was ok, generous portion of meat though.  Nothing special here.  the crowd here is about as un-diverse as you can get. not sure what all the hype is about.	0
"I'm always trying to hit up places that are listed in the fantastic book \""Hamburger America.\"" Tessaro's is one of two places to be listed for Pennsylvania. I visited while in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago with high expectations. I like the joint, it seems like a family run business, and there's a lot of people coming and going. We didn't have to wait long for a table, and the service was fine. I do like the atmosphere, but I just had so many better burgers that I just can't rave about this place.\n\n\nThey don't have a frier, so your burger comes with home fries or potato salad. This wasn't bad, but I really love the classic combination of burgers and fries. Maybe it was an off day. I know they have their own butcher who works in house, and that is exciting. But the burger wasn't memorable at all.\n\n\nBottom Line: I've had better."	0
I've been coming here for the past 10 years and have always enjoyed the food and  the atmosphere, so I'm sad to have to write a review that speaks poorly about the place.  Having said that, my last experience at Tessaro's was ruined before we were even seated.  While waiting with my girlfriend to be seated for 25 minutes, a party of 3 walks in and is immediately seated.  When I ask why a party of 3 would be seated before the many parties of 2 waiting I was told that the seating was laid out specifically to accommodate a specific number of people: absurd!  We proceed to wait another 15 minutes until a 2 top opened up.  \n\nI would gladly recommend this place on the food, but given how inefficient the seating system is I'd only go when you can be seated right away.	0
Tessaro's is so old school it hurts. They're known for their burgers and on this occasion the hype suits the reality.\n\nThe inside becomes somewhat cramped during their busy hours but I always seem to get seated quickly. The meny is traditional and I've only had their burger. Yes, their burger is incredible. It's huge, cooked well, and on a good, sturdy bun. Like all good burgers, the meat steals the show but the veggies keep the burger's pace. I hate a burger that's all meat, Tessaro's is very balanced. I wish they had french fries as a side but, like I said, it's an old school joint and they serve old school sides.\n\nEither way, I can't complain, their homefried potatoes are good.\n\nThe service is impeccable and I haven't had anyone who wasn't over 40 and looked like they'ved worked there their whole life. They know what they're doing and they do it quickly. Tessaro's can handle a crowd, they've been doing it for years.	1
my burger was really dry and tasteless, and I ordered it to be cooked medium. I was disappointed in this place because everyone says its the best burger in town...I must be missing something. I thought the atmosphere kinda sucks and the way seating is done leaves much to be desired...overall might go back to see if it was just a fluke, but wont be rushing there.	0
So everyone always raves about this place infamous burger joint in bloomfield, so I had to try it...and I should just have listened to my capricorn perfectionist gf because she was right when she said it is overrated. We both got burgers...I got the bbq and she got the bleu. The burgers tasted like one part oxygen and 1 part hydrogen. At least the soup was good...and our waitress didnt know how to properly place the salt n pepper shakers....salt on the right(for the blind)....\nAnother negative about this place is that people sit so close to you, just like mad mex. It takes away your privacy, I wanted to talk about baby fetuses but couldnt	0
Never understood all the hype about this place. The burgers are rather bland and burnt.  No fries, only their potato things which are NOT as good as any fry I have ever had.  And the wait was always ridiculous to boot.\n\nI admittedly haven't been here in a few years, but it doesn't seem like this is the type of place that would have changed.	0
Eh,\n\nSo much hype, but the burgers are over ground and too big for the bun.  Maybe it was just over hype, but I want all the wonderful burger things to occur when I'm munching a burger, not just tons o' ground beef in a bun.\n\nTry BRGR just up the road.	0
Give me burgers or give me death!\n\nI think I got that quote right, didn't I?\n\nAs far as I am concerned, they make the best freakin' burgers in the burgh.  I'm sure there are people that would disagree.  Heck, I have friends who would disagree.  But I don't care, I know I'm right.  \n\nWe moved to Pittsburgh from North Carolina and Tessaro's was the first place we encountered that would cook a burger to order at anything other than well done.  And I like my beef pink.\n\nThis place serves up HUGE, tasty burgers with great toppings, and very yummy home fries-style potatoes to go with them.  You could probably substitute the side, but why would you want to?\n\nIf you're hungry when you arrive and can't wait for a burger (or if you are Catholic and grace this place on a Friday during Lent), I enjoy the Seafood Chowder -- rich and creamy with chunks of seafood and just the right combination of seasonings.  \n\nI've never had anything else here, but a friend ordered the steak salad once and I was almost tempted to trade in my burger, it looked so good.	1
My boyfriend and I went here for burgers because there are so many good reviews and we heard that they're the best in the 'burgh.  I was disappointed.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay.  Maybe my expectations are too high, but I don't want a burger that's purely a slab of ground beef with no seasoning or other flavoring in it.  I've had more flavorful burgers at chain restaurants.\n\nI did like the home fries, very yummy!  And an interesting side dish.	0
With how Pittsburghers talk about Tessaro's, you'd think it's the epitome of excellent all-American food.  But after having been here four times, all I can really say is that it's very meh and very Pittsburgh.\n\nI apologize for the bland, boring, generic tone of the rest of the review, but I'm not sure how else to describe the food here...\n\nThe portion is 'American' and the burger was really thick and as juicy as I expected done medium.  As with any BIG burgers I like to cut it in half so it's manageable...and so I can still seem somewhat ladylike.  The first half of the burger was OK/good/no complaints.  The second half just seemed to lack flavor...  I guess during the first half I was just hungry, but when you calm down and taste the order, it was so bland.  I mean of course I could taste the mayo/ketchup/mustard, but the actual meat part was just flavorless.  I was really disappointed by that...\n\nI ordered potato salad as my side and it was good/OK too...nothing to call home about.\n\nIn all honesty I would've rather had Five Guys or In-n-Out burgers.	0
"I know, it's a Pittsburgh institution and we're supposed to rave about it and declare it the \""best in the burgh\"". It's not. Not even close. I've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe I missed something. Maybe it was me. Oh but it's not. It's not me. It's just not that good. Over hyped, underperformed. Burgers are adequate - nothing special. Order something other than a burger and you don't get much better. \n\nYears ago it might have been worthy of its reputation since there weren't a lot of competitors. Now, forget it. Burgers are ubiquitous and great ones are everywhere. Best burger in the city is at Kaya - the Kaya burger. Tessaro's - a fading icon of days gone by.  Enjoy the crowds, convince yourself your getting the best, that you're in the know. You're  not."	0
Very good.  I got the barbecue burger with mild sauce.  Would probably go for hot sauce next time since mild was not spicy at all.  The toppings are nothing special, but the meat itself was cooked well and, for lack of a better term, meaty.  I was hungry and this really hit the spot.  I don't normally go for potato salad, but ordered it based off another review.  It was great!  I even could've eaten a little more than was on the plate.  I also liked the decor/environment -- very homey.	1
This was my first and last time at this restaurant. I thought Tessaro's was some sort of Pittsburgh landmark and I've heard rave reviews of their burgers. The burger I got was undercooked. I ordered it well done and it was definitely pink in the middle. But I didn't send it back because I never send anything back. I just ate it and it was a sloppy, greasy mess. The bread was cheap and tasteless. The home fries were just diced potatoes. That burger sat clogged in my stomach for 3 or 4 hours. And I had to make a few runs to the bathroom because I thought I was going to make a mess in my pants. Burger king is a lot better than this place and at a fraction of the cost. What else you got Pittsburgh? This better not be the best you got.	0
"I can't figure out the hype surrounding the burgers here.  It's at or near the top of more \""Best Burger in Pittsburgh\"" lists than not, and some people have gone so far as to name it the best burger in the state.  I've had burgers at well over 100 places in this state, and let me tell you, Tessaro's isn't even average.\n\nThe ingredients were of good quality, but both creativity in design and skill in preparation were sorely lacking.  I went with a group of five, and not one of us enjoyed the burger.  Also, not one of us got ours cooked as ordered.  I'm willing to accept a variety of interpretations of \""medium rare\"" but no pink and dry throughout is not one of them.\n\nThough shamefully mistreated, the meat's natural flavor, along with non-burger items, rescued Tessaro's from one star territory, but it was pretty obvious the clueless kitchen couldn't hold up to real competition.  (If you want a decent burger, try Burgatory.)"	0
Tessaro's definitely provides a solid burger to their patrons, and their side options are also delicious.  I got the gourmet burger, medium rare, with broccoli and cauliflower.  The veggies were excellent.  The burger was tasty as well, but it was extremely under cooked.  I know I ordered it medium rare, but I doubt it spent more than 30 seconds on the grill.  Next time I will go with Medium.	1
Came here to try their famed burgers.  I ordered the gourmet burger, and not bad.  However, it was absolutely nothing special. I felt like I could easily make it on the grill at home.  Also, the home fries were just mediocre.  \n\nI don't understand all the rave reviews for this place.  As for me, I don't think I'll be back.	0
I ate here this past weekend with my husband and a large group of friends. Although they don't take reservations (at least not this weekend, maybe because of the holiday) our party of 11 was sat together rather quickly at 8:30. Most of us got the Gourmet Cheeseburger and it was delicious! The burger was huge! It was juicy and full of flavor. I had mine topped with blue cheese, along with the onions and mushrooms. I chose to get the chips as my side and they were not homemade, something I was hoping for since all the other food was of such high quality. Our waitress was a bit scatterbrained and when she brought our food out, had no idea who got what and kept insisting the plates were right even though we each remembered what we got. Other than that, it was a great experience and I would definitly go back.	1
This is going to be short and sweet. It's the best burger in the 'Burgh, hands down! The in-house ground beef is so much better than what those trendy burger bars are offering right now. Tessaro's doesn't need to top their burgers with a bunch of ridiculous toppings as their beef is just that damn good. I don't even want to try anything else there as the burger was the first thing I ever had and I keep getting it every time I go there. The BBQ burger cooked medium is perfection!	1
This review only encompasses my 2-3 experiences with burgers - THE thing Tessaro's is known for. All I can say is - I don't get the hype. If it weren't for the blue cheese and bacon it would have been borderline inedible. There didn't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever. Bland would be an understatement. \n\nPoints for using fresh hand formed beef and consistently preparing it at the requested level of done-ness, but I don't know how the burger here even enter any debate regarding the best burger in the 'Burgh. I'd even say Lot 17 a few doors up has more flavorful burgers - saying nothing of places like Wingharts and Burgatory.\n\nService is always friendly and prompt - but the food is just...OK. I think this place is just more of a Pittsburgh tradition like the similarly overrated Primanti's.	0
I should preface this by saying this wasn't my pick, and not really my kind of place.  That being said, it's a decent conventional style restaurant and not bad for what it is. \n\nI had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy.  The boiled red skinned potatoes were pretty much what you'd expect boiled red skinned potatoes to be, and they come with melted butter on the side in case you'd really like to pack an artery.  This is definitely not a meal for anyone worried about TMAO.\n\nI don't want to be too hard on the place because, you know, it is what it is, and for what it is, it's not that bad, not that good, just ok; something like that.  \n\nNow, I just wonder how long that burger is going to remain in my gut.  I think I can feel the bacteria burping away in there right about now... Ugh.	0
I have heard a good amount of positive reviews of this place from lots of different people. That being said, I was expecting to be wowed by their burgers, which is the reason people told me to go. \n\nHowever, when I arrived with my guest, 8:00 PM on Thursday night, I was kind of disappointed. Not only did the waitress take a good 10 minutes before she brought us water, but she was not very attentive and never checked back with us until she brought the bill. The burger was so-so with little flavor, which was very disappointing. I could also tell that a few other tables in my section were looking around waiting for their server.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed by the quality of food as well as the service.	0
I want to go back to give it a better review, but here is my experience. I called ahead and asked if they had highchairs. When we showed up they only had booster seats. 3 years ago I wouldn't have known the difference, but after spending 2 minutes watching my 1.5 year old thrash around I can tell you their is a big difference. The waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him. Yelp says good for kids they said we have a high chair. The waitress was about as warm and friendly as a night in spent sleeping in the snow naked. The potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par. The burgers are big and if you looking for a giant patty of cheap meat then this is your place. I feel bad because unlike most places I give two stars I really want to like this place.	0
This is the only burger place I have ever been to that doesn't serve french fries. WTF? Went once, only due to bad weather, and would never go again.	0
A classic old-school joint. The bar dates back I don't know how long. And the service has that old-school quality. I wanted for nothing. I was stuffed by the burger they served me. It was tasty and delicious. I can't wait to go back and enjoy another.	1
Out of 5:\n3.5 - Burger: The first several times I came here, it was terribly overcooked and dry.  Then, all of a sudden, their quality and consistency of cooking went up significantly.

"I am only giving this two stars because I believed the hype. The burger I had was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had, and the menu--even for a carnivore like me---was too meat heavy. And we had to wait to be seated and it was not super cheap, so all these things combined make me less than thrilled with the experience. Perhaps if I had the burger cooked medium rare, things would be different, but I still crown Industry reigning king of all (Pitts) burgers. However, things are not bad by any means, they just aren't the absolute best, as I was hoping for. And there wasn't enough bread to hold the burger, causing me to do the unthinkable and use a knife! The highlight of the night though, was hearing a man refer to his wife as \""my darling\"" when she wasn't even within earshot."	0
We dined here in January with friends and had a really good time. The burgers are huge and flavorful. I had the barbecue bacon burger which was fantastic. My wife had the reuben burger and was disappointed with the quality and flavor. Drinks are pricey here, beware. Also, it gets crowded here quick! Get there before 6 for sure if you want to avoid waiting.	1
This is my all time favorite restaurant in Bloomfield. I have never had a bad meal here and have been going here since I was a kid. My favorites are the steak salad with their awesome homemade ranch dressing, chili, gourmet chicken sandwich, and tier homefries and potato salad are the best sides they offer! Sometimes depending on the wait staff they will give you half homefries and half potato salad to enjoy both! You can never go wrong with the bbq burger - I get it with mild BBQ sauce and add cheddar cheese and bacon. I am dying to try the deli burger but have yet to do so.	1
"After getting one of their \""famous\"" burgers, I really don't understand the hype. Mediocre food and mediocre service."	0
"We ate here last weekend on the recommendation of my son's professors.  They told him to 'look for the smoke\"" and we would be there.  We did follow the smoke and it smelled wonderful.  We were able to find a parking lot about two blocks away but the walk was nice.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes which is good considering the size of the place and all the people waiting.  The place is small with a large bar, dimly lit, you can watch the cooks make your food through a large window at the back of the dining room.  We couldn't get past the burger menu. There are other things on the menu but we came for burgers.  I has the blue cheese/bacon burger and it was fantastic.  The home fries were so good but they contain bacon in case your a vegetarian and don't expect it.  They are great.  My husband had a cheddar burger and it too was great.  Full bar service.  Can't wait to go back!"	1
Sure, the burgers are supposed to be out of this world. I find them kinda meh. But that's because I'm not a fan of burgers. The smell of the grill draws you in from blocks away. \n\nWhat I am a fan of is a place that can actually cook your meat to the requested temperature. By golly, Tessaro's never fails. I ask for a rare steak on the spinach salad, rare it is. Ask for a medium rare burger, done! I overheard a lady praising the kitchen on her well done steak, is that even possible?\n\nI've eaten here MANY times, not that difficult since I've lived in the neighborhood over a decade, and I've heard just about every conversation you could expect. What I've never heard is anyone complaining about the meat temp. \n\nThat is amazing. \n\nSo is the potato salad, though I wish it had egg chunks in it.	1
This is not only the best burger in Pittsburgh. It's also the best burger in the USA. Cooked to perfection. \n\nThe home fires are off the hook too. \n\nThere is other stuff on the menu but stick with the burgers. \n\nGreat eats. When in Pittsburgh I will make time for a stop at Tessaro's.	1
4 of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks. The pino Grigio tasted bitter and when we complained the waitress acted like we were bothering her by saying anything and kept trying to walk away. She only came to our table 2 times when we were there over two hours. \n\nBad customer service and to be honest we had bad service all around.	0
As an update, if you get the veggies as your side don't get them cooked on the grill. Sometimes they will do this and char them a bit which is delicious but if your burger is cooked in the same spot the residual plant matter sullies the flavor of the meat.	1
We came for steaks. Mistake. Probably great burgers (if you read the reviews), but that's it. They don't know how to cook steaks unless you like hockey pucks. They also have a wind problem every time the front door is open. Finally, a supposed owner that works as hostess needs to concentrate on her job and learn how a restaurant is run. We won't go back.	0
I went at lunch, so it was a little crowded for my liking, but that's to be expected. Despite how crowded it was the service was excellent and I very much enjoyed my HUGE breakfast burger. Reasonable prices, cute, local place. Would definitely go again.	1
Horrible Food, Horrendous Customer Service, #overrated\n\nSo I already wasted 2 hours of my life eating at this place, so I am not going to write a thesis as to why someone should not be a patron of this restaurant.  In summation, when we arrived we were harassed by the owner (acting as the hostess) for wanting to sit in the corner, served flat beer, and then interrogated by her after sending an order back for not meeting the clear specifications given to the waitress.  Living in Latin America and traveling in Asia for some time, I have been to a lot of hellholes, but this is hands down the worst place I have ever been.  Not only was the food lousy and way overpriced, but we were hassled by the belligerent, sarcastic, and condescending owner almost the entire time. Clearly, customer service nor quality of food are valued.  Honestly, I would rather starve than eat here again.	0
One of the most delicious burger in Pittsburgh !	1
If you like cheap, divey bars you need to get yourself to Teabags.  One of the very few bars that I've been to in Pittsburgh with a legitimate mix of people from all walks of life.  The bartenders are almost always lovely (only had one wacky one so far) and the patrons are delightful.  There's a pool table that is usually open, though it's not the finest table in town it fits the vibe of the place.  The drinks are dirt cheap.  The beer is always cold and the mix drinks are strong.  This place is just really perfect in my opinion and I'm just sad I didn't discover it sooner.	1
We just got back from our dinner at the Pleasure Bar. I ordered eggplant parmesan, starting with wedding soup. The soup was pretty good, although a tiny bit oily and a tiny bit salty. The eggplant parmesan came in a hearty portion with penne and pomodoro sauce. Their sauce is just the right amount of sweet and I enjoyed it. The eggplant was tasty and well seasoned, but a bit chewy around the edges. The prices are very reasonable, and the wait staff was friendly and approachable. The decor is a little PIer One but that's forgivable. \n\nI didn't deduct any stars for this since it's *technically* a special circumstance, but the only downside of the night was that the servers sat down to wrap silverware by turning the TV on really loud right behind us to the series finale of Lost, which I had planned on watching at a later date. Talk about a spoiler alert! \n\nIs this the BEST Italian food in the area? Probably not. But I'm also no expert on Italian food. In all, I found it tasty and a definitely a good value for the price.	1
When I first moved to the city I drove by the Pleasure Bar all the time thinking it was a strip club. Imagine my surprise when JB suggested we go there for dinner one night!\n\nEverything was tasty - we ordered the assorted fried platter that came with mozz sticks (pretty basic but hey! The cheese was still inside all of them!!!), fried zucchini and potato balls (plump little balls fried crispy on the outside and bursting with creamy whipped potato goodness on the inside). Bruschetta was full of flavor as was the rolled eggplant.\n\nPlenty of parking (paid) in the back of the restaurant.\n\nEvery time we are there we have the same server, Jim, which is cool by us because he's pretty top notch .	1
"i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time. my fiance and i went with a couple who live in bloomfield and go to this restaurant every two weeks or so. We walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table. We stood near the host area for 10 minutes. Several employees including the host walked passed us over a dozen times and never said anything to us. Finally my friend asked how long the wait for a table would be. The host looked at us rudely and said \""I don't know, 20 to 30 minutes.\"" He was so rude and huffy. We left because of how unhelpful the staff was. I was excited about dining at this place before 10 minutes of frustration. We left immediately and went to the Thia restaurant down the street. It was excellent and they actually valued us as customers."	0
The appetizers were great. Stuffed mushrooms, but my seafood pasta just came up bland and too oily. The broccoli in it was overcooked and the shrimp were undercooked. Italian wedding soup was okay--tasted like it came from a can. For the price though, it was pretty worth it. \n\nWould only go back for the stuffed muchrooms	0
Wow! If I could give negative stars I certainly would for this place. I wanted it to be decent because they have an ok draught selection and seating outside in the summer. That is where the positive qualities end. Food tasted like it came from a microwave - but that is actually generous, probably actually came from Fido's dog bowl. This is an excellent candidate for kitchen nightmares, the place looks straight out of the 80's and not in a cool hipster way either.	0
The food here is very good.  I did find the service a tad slow but of all the italian places in this area I would go here first.\n\nI had an italian hoggie that was very good and yes they do have excellent meatballs.	1
Well to be honest this was one of the worst dinning experiences of my eating career. We sat outside and the service was VERY SLOW. Then my purse gets stolen right from my hand by what I can only describe as a gang of thugs. As if that wasn't bad enough the slow wait staff took about ten minutes to call the police and then proceeded to charge us for our mediocre meals even as they saw me telling the police how my wallet had been stolen under the waitstaffs not so watchful eye. Save your money and your wallet and go to wendy's the quality is far superior to this place.	0
Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost $9.00. (My fault, I should have asked, I guess.) Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners.	0
not my fav! weird mixture of sit-downy restaurant and bar, with neither being really good.	0
Despicable service at the bar, very selective about who they serve, and incredibly rude when you request service after they ignore you for 20 minutes.	0
This place does not have good italian sauce it tasted like chef boyardee and my crab cakes were not cooked in the middle it was cold. I wont be back.	0
Clean and professional.  Not so cozy beds during the winter.  I was able to get extra towels when we asked for them  Parking does suck as the other review stated.  But we are in Pittsburgh!  It was what i expected!	1
We checked in very late but the concierge was very helpful.  The lobby is big and inviting and there's free coffee and wi-fi.  The rooms were clean and big, but what really sold me was the customer service.  The staff was super kind especially when I realized I had forgotten my family heirloom jewelry.  They were quick to assist me during my panic state and were able to locate my belongings and made sure they were safe within 5 minutes. Would definitely stay here again.	1
I think it may be a crime to give fewer than five stars to Twisters.  Seriously, they're awesome.  Their soft-serve (try half chocolate, half vanilla!) is probably the best on the planet and they offer homemade ice cream sandwiches.  Everything is affordable, so you can easily feed your frozen dessert addiction.  On hot days, or heck, even on lukewarm days, this is the place to be.	1
Oh Twisters is fun. We had ice cream here not long ago. I had some Blizzard-type thing, and it was delicious. The girl behind the window was a sweetheart too. I loved her hair and piercings.	1
The beauty of living directly next to Twisters is that well I have an unlimited supply of frozen goodies right in my backyard literally.\n\nI only get the chocolate vanilla swirl for myself and a small scoop of sugar free vanilla ice cream for the puppy.\n\nThe ladies that work there during the summer are always super nice.\n\nNothing to ever complain about here.	1
They have so many oldies but goodies! However, they stopped making the homemade ice cream sandwiches because they don't have the wafers :( Still a nice treat.  FYI, they only take cash	1
Living in South Side almost ruined my love of sports bars -- all I want is a place to watch a game and enjoy some fried food and drinks, without sloppy drunk girls spilling beers on me. Thankfully, my friends took me to Silky's and reminded me that it's worth it to cross the river now and then for a drink. \n\nThe bar food is quality -- I highly recommend the fried zucchini. There's also the Munchies Platter, with provolone sticks, onion rings, chicken wings. It is so massive, my arteries almost went on strike. Crowd is good company, bathrooms are surprisingly clean, and there's about five TVs for your viewing pleasure. If I lived in Bloomfield, I'd definitely be more of a regular.	1
Pretty good sports bar.  I didn't have any food, but they've got a decent beer selection, and prices and specials are pretty good.  They've got plenty of screens to watch your favorite event(s), and the outdoor seating on the sidewalk is good, too, if you want to escape the sports crowd but still enjoy some of the atmosphere.	1
We had heard good things about this little neighborhood bar, good beer selection (check), cheerful service (check), good prices on drinks (check), and food (check), and supposedly good food.\n\nThe only problem that our party of 6 had was the way the place was set up, they don't allow smoking inside but they should of. All of the smokers were standing outside in front of a giant sliding, garage style door and all of the smoke was sucked back into the bar. \n\nAll of us agreed this is the worst place we have been in for smoke and some of our group were smokers, they didn't even like it. So if your idea is to sit inside a smokey hazy bar you will love it, but to sit in that atmosphere and dine was impossible. We left for cleaner air.	0
Incredible drink specials, great atmosphere, and delicious food.  You can't really go wrong there.  They have daily specials and awesome beers on tap.  The pricing is reasonable, for both food and drink.  Non smoking inside, but easy access to smoking outside.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The jukebox isn't bad.  All in all I was pleasantly suprised with how much I actually enjoyed this place.  I was a little leary at first, as I kept associating it with Silky's the strup bar in McKees Rocks.	1
Out of my three day, 3 state bar crawl this was my favorite bar. Service was good, the beer selection wasnt amazing but okay, and they had shuffle board. But what sold me was the Silky's had that homey feel to it.	1
I came here for dinner with some friends the other night and it was pretty fun. It was really quiet when we got there and there weren't too many people. It wasn't crowded at all... surprisingly. \n\nWe all tried their pumpkin spice martini which is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I highly recommend it to everyone. It is so good! \n\nThe food on the other hand is just your standard pub fare. It doesn't taste particularly better than any food you'd get at any other pub. It was just okay. I had a buffalo chicken wrap which was good. \n\nOur waitress was on top of things which was nice, but then again, how could you not be on a slow night without many tables right? \n\nAnyway, we had a fun time here. As for the food, I probably wouldn't go back JUST for the food. If I were meeting  a group of people here, I'd definitely come back, but on my own, maybe not.	1
The only bad thing I can say is that the calamari rings need more sauce and more spice.\n\nThe greens and feta on flat bread was delicious but the flat bread is plain, limp and superfluous.\n\nThe burgers are large and covered in goodness.\nI asked for bacon instead of ham and I was rewarded with a fistful of mana atop my hand formed patty. The egg was a little over cooked and did not drip as I'd hoped.\n\nThe beer selection is good.\n\nThe TV's are a plenty.	1
I really like Silky's- it's a great little bar with a good two list. Last time I was there the southern tier 2xipa was on. So. Good. I had the Reuben and was so happy with it. \nCrispy buttery bread with corned beef and sauerkraut. The fries on the side were crispy and soft in the middle.\nI'll be back!	1
Excellent food! Excellent service! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal with great service.	1
Flies in this place.	0
I love this place for a quick bit!! If ur on a diet this is a great to stop for fast food ..yummmyyy lunch stop	1
I came here for a filling after not having time to get it completed by my hometown dentist over Christmas break in early 2011. Not only was the filling $120 (no insurance), payment was demanded immediately upon exit, I also felt very disrespected by the office as a whole. The front staff is very curt and short. The gentleman who did my drilling had a patronizing and smart alleck attitude. When asking questions about the procedure he was doing, he mockingly imitated my voice (I am sorry I am not the most clear and articulate when I have a rod down my mouth getting a filling) to ask me what I said. He was very patronizing the whole time and unsympathetic to my legitimate worries I had seeing as this was the first time I went to a dentist other than the one I went to my entire life since childhood. I would never go back under any circumstance.\n\nEDIT: In my original review I stated this procedure was $250. The correct amount was actually $120. My apologies.	0
I stopped by the Pittsburgh Jiffy Lube on Baum today to get an oil change and tire rotation.  There really aren't a lot of choices to get an oil change on the weekend.  Overall, I had a good experience.  The service was quick, the staff was friendly and everything seems in order. They give out these massive coupon books with oil change/service discounts to get people to come back which I will likely get me to go back.\n\nLike most places like this, they offer to do extra services (air filter change for example) which you could probably do on your own without much hassle.	1
It took more time to write this review than it did to get my oil change. Nice location.	1
They are friendly professional reliable quick I think that's enough . I keep coming back to them because I trust them.	1
$400 IN DAMAGES\n\nThey cracked my oil pan and it cost me four hundred dollars to repair. Everything was fine before I brought it here. Mechanic said it looked like they put my bolt in crooked and then hammered it in. Avoid at all cost. They will ruin your car.	0
Never go to this Jiffy Lube.  They tried to charge me $45 for an oil change- no way! I just asked them to change my headlight bulb, and it took an hour and a half.  They kept taking other peoples car who had come in after me, probably because they weren't making much money off of me.  It took them at least a half hour to actually change the bulb- I looked over and 4 people were under the hood trying to figure it out.  Clearly they have no idea what they are doing because last time I needed this service it was done in 5 minutes.  All of the employees were rude and had an attitude.  I would NEVER go back or recommend this place to anyone!	0
Very good service. Came in for an oil change, was informed about other things that might need to be changed in the future, and was not made to feel guilty when I declined. The service worker even gave me a tip about making sure that my toll money is no-where in site when I get my next service change to avoid tempting some dishonest people out there (turns out the corners of a few bills were showing out of one compartment...all bills were still there). He gave me a 10$ discount even though I didn't come in with a coupon, and the oil change was complete in 20 minutes. Will go back.	1
Terrible experience. I dropped my car off at 9:25 AM on a Saturday and there was one other person in front of me. I didn't leave until 11:05AM and was charged $99 for a synthetic oil changed. Overpriced, terrible customer service, and long wait times. Never coming back here.	0
Very bad service. They are extremely slow. I waited 90 minutes even though there were just 2 cars in front of me. I bought the signature service which includes vacuuming which they didn't do at all. When I told them that, they just lied and said they did. Never going back here!	0
I went here with a couple friends, and we had two appetizers plus our entrees.  The nacho appetizer was great; the beef strips appetizer was not quite up to par for the price.  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich--the chicken was grilled just right without being too dry, and the buffalo sauce was perfect (hot, but not overwhelmingly so).  They had a good draft beer selection.  Overall, a good time, I'd certainly go back.	1
"Pittsburgh is a town where \""bar food\"" means the exact same menu in every last place you'd drink a beer, with the fryer in heavy rotation.\n\nMy girlfriend and I both had sandwiches, and they were among the best I ever recall eating.  I had a portabella mushroom sandwich, and at no point did I wish I'd just ordered a burger.  \n\nAs far as bar food goes, this is the best I know.\n\nEdit: Went back and was less impressed; dropping this from 5 to 4 stars.  Nothing particularly wrong, but not in the \""best thing ever\"" category.  Still really solid."	1
Go there only if you want served uncooked fish, odd tasting salad, or way too sweet tea (btw - no unsweetened).	0
Lot 17 is a great little neighborhood bar in Bloomfield. It's places like this which remind me why I love Bloomfield. The patrons know each other, the bartenders know the patrons, and if you are a stranger to the place they will get to know you too. \n\nGreat old time feel here with a wonderful ornate tile ceiling, brick walls, and a beautiful old bar. Beer prices are reasonable with a very wide selection of drafts and bottles, but are by no means the cheapest in the area. I haven't tried much of the food except for the wings, which are good and a safe bet if you don't know what to order. \n\nLot 17 is a PITT bar and a great place to watch a Saturday football game or a basketball game. I also believe that during the basketball season it is host to the Jamie Dixon radio show. Just don't come in here with WVU gear on and you will be just fine!	1
Dude. We're over here. No? No eye contact?  Too busy with your iPhone?  \n\nThe bartender was beat. We left without being acknowledged or served (and we literally waived our arms).  Could be good, but who'd know.   Wasn't busy either.  You're fired.	0
My Merlot was decent but the calamari was not. The calamari while had hints of Italian seasoning was bland and became soggy of the cooked vegetables that they had underneath it. Plus I think I found a fry or two with the vegetables. Also Lot 17 had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there. Service could have been better. I might return for drinks but only drinks.	0
I've been here twice and ordered to-go once.  The food is bad!  Last night our table ordered French fries, stuffed portabella mushrooms, and calamari.  The best of the dishes were the mushrooms stuffed w crab meat and topped w red peppers...the fries and calamari were terrible!  I don't want to come back here...it's over priced and the food is below ave	0
I always enjoy my time at Lot 17. You can just hang out and grab a beer or enjoy some food in the back. The food is amazing. I especially enjoy the Mediterranean Seafood Salad. It is a MUST ORDER. The sweet potato fries are a great compliment to any of the burgers, wraps, or sandwiches. Go to Lot 17, you will not regret it.	1
Atmosphere Nice / Sports on every television with Volume Up Boooooo!\nBread Pudding by far the Bestest in the Burgh!	1
The Lot is my spot. Had a party there on Friday night and it was great. We had about 25 people upstairs. John made us fish and a filet and both were really good. We had an open bar for three hours to go along with the food and Lisa waited on us and hustled up and down the stairs all night. All in the total cost was reasonable and we all had a blast. Definitely recommend the lot for your next party of 20 to 25 people.	1
"I came here for the first time Saturday to watch the atrocious pitt vs. UVA football game. We got there early enough to secure Seats at the bar. It got packed quickly once the game started as lot 17 is a true \""pitt\"" bar. Service at the bar was very prompt and friendly despite them being very busy. We started off with an order of garlic jerk wings which were very tasty. Not overly spicy or garlicky and cooked perfectly crisp. I later ordered the Rachael with sweet potato fries. My boyfriend ordered the Reuben with Cajun fries.they have several other menu items that looked good: a salmon blt, crab cake sandwich, turkey club on focaccia, and many burgers that are very good from what my boyfriend says. The Rachael was really good- the rye was marble which I prefer. The sweet potato fries were served with a honey butter that was amazing! He liked his Reuben a lot and the Cajun fries were good but too spicy for my tastes. Beer selection is really stellar too- lots of good craft drafts. This is one of my boyfriends favorite Bars so we will surely be back."	1
The only positive thing I can say is about this place it is open late.\n\nWe ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed.\nPancakes were burnt. Hash browns were burnt. A breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it. I was drunk I don't remember.\n\nBah. Cook/waiter was funny, so points for that.\n\nAgain, the only good thing was that it was open when I wanted food.	0
Don't let the outside fool you! My girlfriend used to live in Bloomfield and we discovered it by just walking in looking for something cheap. The place is tiny but it doesn't matter because the food is good and the portions are big and most importantly it's cheap. I always got the $3.95 breakfast at least I think it was $3.95 all I know is it costs less than $5 for a meal. The staff are friendly and you don't wait long for your food. Wish I could go more often but I can never remember the hours as they are open later at night than during the day.	1
A great option when there are no other options.  If you find yourself devastatingly hungry in Bloomfield at 3am to drunk to drive or walk ANYPLACE else, sure, go for it.  Otherwise, take a pass- your insides will thank you in the morning.  The times I have eaten here have induced self loathing  of the worst kind..  the only thing worse are the stomach cramps brought on as a result- but I was drunk and it seemed like a good idea at that moment.	0
Mama Ros's (sic) is a great place to eat late at night or early in the morn. They have weird hours, weird cooks, weird customers, and great food. \n\nThe price is great and the silver dollar pancakes are soooo good.	1
Nice, cheap diner food with a great, homie little vibe. Plenty of interesting people drop through all the time, and there's always good conversation.\n\nThe service is occasionally a bit slow when the diner fills up, but it's not usually much of a problem. The food isn't exemplary, but considering the restaurant's very reasonable prices, it feels like a deal.\n\nI stop by a couple times a week, would definitely recommend it.	1
If you're into diner food and unpretentious plates, then this is the place for you. (And me, and everyone alike.)\n\nThe Sandwich Shop doesn't look like that much from the outside but the warmth and atmosphere that Mama Ros and Mike put into it, is something amazing. \n\nJust had some coffee, and a modest plate of over-easy eggs with rye bread--but the eggs were cooked perfectly and the coffee great. If I remember correctly, you can customize your pancakes etc... Yes. A million times yes.\n\nI'll be sure to pay Mama Ros a second visit if I'm ever in Bloomsfield again. So should you.	1
This place has the worst french fries I have ever tasted. They were literally BLACK. All I tasted was burnt oil. My photo is the zucchini planks and that lump of blackness are the French fries that I was sent home with. I could not even eat one! I also ordered the zucchini planks and a grilled cheese on rye with bacon. The grilled cheese was incredibly dry and the cook put the bread together upside down, like it did not match up...One piece of bread was the opposite way than the other. Also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should. Ugh. The zucchini planks were delicious. 1 out of 3 is not great. My sister raved about this place. I am so disappointed. Disgusting. DO NOT EAT HERE. I spent $30 for only one edible thing worth $4. So pissed!	0
Very average Italian food.  If you're looking for a pasta+sauce experience, it's pretty boring.  Eggplant parm was a little better than average.  But all in all, not any more exciting than what I can make for myself with a jar of sauce and box of pasta.	0
The food - bruschetta and fried ravioli apps, side salad, 1/2 order of aglio olio, and rice pudding - was pretty good. The aglio olio and rice pudding were the best parts of the meal. The service was good. Everyone was friendly. The interior could use some sprucing, but, all in all, it was good Italian food. I'll be back for the half-priced wine!	1
Not real Italian. When there's a crab dish on the menu and you don't let your customers know this there's a problem. Imitation crab meat at an Italian restaurant doesn't fly. I was hoping for some good Italian while out of town and was truly disappointed. The bar service was extremely friendly about my compliant and did remove that dish from my bill. My entree was pasta and shrimp. I haven't paid $20 for a dish of pasta and 5 large shrimp in a long time. Don't worry but I won't come close to this restaurant again.	0
I wasn't really a fan. In fact, this may hae been some of the most sub-par Italian food I've had (it seemed very touristy), and it was definitely my least favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh while traveling there on business the past few months. Cute ambiance! Cute neighborhood! Friendly local wait staff! But kinda touristy & uninteresting food pairings / ingredients.	0
Looking at all the other reviews about this place, I wondered if we actually went to the same place.  I thought it wasn't very good.  I had the Eggplant Alexander which consisted of a bunch of soggy fried eggplant with a ton of cheese melted on it.  I've made much better at home.  My beloved had veal Parmesan.   Which was dry, overcooked and lukewarm.  Did we catch them on a bad day?  I'll never know because I don't think we'll return.	0
I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today, half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entr\u00e9e too, but at least it was edible.)\n\nI finally think I'm done with this place.	0
I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant bringing 8 out of town guests from across the country. The food was outstanding and the wait staff is very accommodating. Alex made a special effort to make sure our time there was enjoyable. Good authentic Italian cuisine at a very reasonable price.	1
Suffice it to say, this is not real Italian food and it's below average and overpriced when it comes to American-Italian food. The staff was excellent though and you will have great service and conversation. Thanks but probably won't be back.	0
Very nice classic Pittsburgh neighborhood Italian.  Best choice for hearty, simple popular Italian dishes  I took my parents there for dinner and we all enjoyed our meal.  My mom loved her chicken parm.  My clam sauce with whole wheat pasta was absolutely perfectly al-dente.  Salad is fresh with a very nice balsamic vinagrette.  Wedding soup was a bit salty, but otherwise perfectly fit my conception of what wedding soup should be.  Dad had the tortilla soup (I know; odd choice) and he liked it quite a bit.  Standout item was the beans & greens which were very fresh.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere is a bit dated and very Pittsburgh, but if you are looking for decent American Italian at good prices with good service, highly recommend.	1
"Crappy, boring, limpid. \n\nThe pastrami tasted bland, the bread was borderline stale and uninteresting, and the whole sandwich was a little wet and lukewarm. Got a Penn Pilsener from the bar, and it had the unmistakable taste of dirty lines - a little sour tang of lactic bacteria. \n\nHow is this place \""famous\""? Is it really? Can anyone please just brine some brisket and hand-slice it?"	0
"If you're famous, why is there never anyone in your restaurant?  Seriously, I live right around the corner, and I've never seen more than one customer in there at a time, and it's completely empty about 3/4 of the time I walk or drive by.  As one other reviewer rightly pointed out, Sammy's seems to be famous for claiming to be famous.\n\n(Note: this is for a visit about ten months earlier - could've sworn I'd already written one.)  I'd been walking/driving past Sammy's for several months after moving into the neighborhood when I decided to finally hoof it over and try one of their \""famous\"" corned beef sandwiches.  The sandwich itself was, well, mediocre at best.  There was a decent amount of meat, but it was pretty average.  The other ingredients were also...average - certainly nothing that would generate \""fame\"" because of its flavor.  \n\nService was the usual gruff, put-upon treatment I've come to expect from small businesses in da 'Burgh.  Prices were okay, but no great bargain.  I haven't been back.\n\nThree stars for the sammich, 1.5 for the rest."	0
One of my favorite Thai places, maybe ever.  Fresh, sweet, spicy and all around good.  Not super heavy or cloying sweet.  Friendly service and all at a fair price.  \n\nI hate hearing my neighbors, though.	1
well i finally took the advice of fellow yelpers and gave Thai Cuisine a shot last weekend.   I showed up at 930 on Friday night and the place was packed.  I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.  Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect.  Like so often at thai restaurants i am always sad when i get to the bottom of the bowl.    Looking forward to my next visit. (4.5 stars)	1
"First visit to Thai Cuisine (interesting name, no?) and first visit to Pittsburgh, so that should set up this review nicely. Context is, of course, that I expected very little from this town, yet I've been completely surprised. #1 - faux meat on a menu is a huge plus for me, I just love it, and I don't care to hear comments like \""if you are a vegetarian, why would you eat something that is meant to taste and look like meat?\"" Shut up. I just like it. #2 - the prices are so cheap. I only looked at the vegetarian menu where every entree is about $10 for dinner, and while that's no steal nor does it compare to Thai food prices in Thailand, it's decent. #3 - cutest. waitress. ever. AND she mentioned that \""all of my cool friends have read that book\"" which, by default, makes me a cool kid? Hmmm. Maybe. Then again, maybe not."	1
"Best Thai food in town, for sure.  Screw all those other places, they're inferior and probably cost way more.\n\nThe green curry is my favorite thing, but the yellow curry is pretty good.  There are vegetarian options (although I usually go for the meat), and one time they had a salmon tom kha gai soup special, which I wasn't sure was a good idea, but it was actually a terrific idea.\n\nOne of the few places I can take any or all of my family or in-laws and be sure that everyone will enjoy themself.\n\nThe name kind of lends itself to semi-comedic confusion, though:\n\""Where do you want to go for dinner?\""\n\""How about Thai Cuisine?\""\n\""Thai sounds great.  Where do you want to go?\""\n\""Um... Thai Cuisine?\""\n(Wash, rinse, repeat...)"	1
Delicious-- try the spicy basil noodles.  Really relaxed atmosphere, nice low lighting, friendly staff.  Your water glass will never get more than a third empty!  \n\nOh, sometimes I really miss Pittsburgh.	1
What's not to love about Thai Cuisine?  Relaxed and spacious atmosphere.  Friendly hosts who will humor you if you try to speak Thai to them, and of course great Thai food. \n\nThey were even kind enough to offer me a generous handful of Kaffir lime leaves when I wanted to try my own hand at some Thai cookin!	1
"Pretty good Thai, though slightly overrated. Hit and miss, with the curries more solid than anything else I've tried. Enormous portions.\n\nAmbience is very open and casual but somehow still pretty \""nice\"". Seating is never an issue.\n\nIt's good to have more BYOB options. Go here with some friends casually, bring a growler or a couple of bombers, have a good relaxed time. Overall, I'm a fan, but wish my friends would want to go here less often."	1
When I lived in Pittsburgh, I was always trying to find the best Thai restaurant. I failed miserably. So when I visited for July 4th, I had a friend take me to her favorite place. This was it! and I was grateful!\n\nI went with about 8 people and we BYOB'ed which was a fantastic idea. Some semi-sweet white wine went well with the flavorful light Thai food. Most of the table had the curries(I thought the red was the best), but I went with the eggplant with the vegetarian duck. Simply delicious! Highly highly recommend it. The spicy basil sauce was the highlight. My partner had one of the chef specials, which was by far the most interesting, but maybe not the tastiest. \n\nOverall, an affordable, low-fuss, great place to eat. There also seemed to be a steady crowd there when we got there and left. It looks like a popular spot. For good reason!	1
Thai Cuisine is one of the best Thai places I've been to in the States - finding it in Pittsburgh was a real surprise.  The food here is outstanding, and the service is comparable to what I'd expect in a $50/person restaurant, and this place is definitely not $30/plate.  With appetizers, Thai iced tea, and two entrees, my girlfriend and I paid about $30.\n\nI highly recommend the cold chicken and sprout salad.  Wish I could remember the name of it, because it's heavenly.  (...Which probably assumes that heaven looks like Thailand.  ...Which would be a nice place to spend eternity.)  Thai iced tea is really good, too.	1
Like other reviewers have said, this place is very basic but the service is fast and friendly and the food was amazing. The vegetarian Tom Yum soup was perfect! We ordered the special of the day - a fried trout dish which was incredible. The price was very reasonable too. The six year old in our party (who doesn't like spicy food) loved the fried dumpling which was recommended by our server and one of the house specialties - three flavored chicken. We ordered the banana springroll for desert - also tasty. Don't expect a fancy place but if you want really good and fast thai food, this is the place to go in Pittsburgh.	1
I'm not a Thai food expert, but I really really enjoy their food.  The 3 spice duck is great, Pad Thai is fantastic, as well as almost all the appetizers.  The servers are so nice and accommodating.  The decor could use updating.  Closed on Tuesdays, which somehow is always the day I'm craving it.	1
i was very excited to try this place.  thai is one of my favorite cuisines ever!!!  but i was sorrily disappointed. we started with spring rolls, through the rice wrapper i could see that the lettuce was browning, a sure sign that the rolls were not made to order.  the pad thai was dry and tasteless.  my friends curry and potatoes tasted like water with a touch of curry powder.  i hate giving poor reviews but nothing that i ate at thai cuisine was yummy.	0
After moving from SF to Denver about 1.5 years ago, I've missed good Thai food.  Luckily, I've found myself in Pittsburgh for a week for work.  I found Thai Cuisine on Yelp and loved it!  I took a short drive from my hotel, near CMU campus, across a bridge into a very authentic little Pittsburgh neighborhood.  As soon as I saw their special, Winter Curry, (Green Curry that includes Kabocha Squash, Zucchini, Potatoes, Carrots, Chicken), I was thrilled.  And, after tasting this scrumptiousness, I was hooked for life!  I gave 4 stars and not 5 only due to it not being an amazing environment...but for food only, definitely a 5 star!\nHaven't left Pitt yet but already excited for a return trip for more yummy Thai!	1
Very solid Thai place. I have the fried spring rolls, which was good (crispy flaky crust, but the filling wasn't anything to write about), the vegetarian tom yum soup (pretty good, but honestly I've had better tasting broth), and the winter curry.  The curry was interesting, but the kabocha squash (which i'm a fan of) didn't seem to fit in right with the curry.  The curry itself was good and the dish was a good effort.  My gf had the vegetarian pad thai.  She thought it was good, but a little too soupy (too much fluid).\n\nAlso, they offer most things spiciness from a scale of 1 to 10.  They said 5 is good, but I tasted almost no spice.  I'd go for a 10 next time.\n\nFrom what I read this places is among the best in Pitt, and I can see how this might be true.  Next time I'm in Pitt, I'll definitely consider coming back.	1
Took a friend to chow down at this thai restaurant. \n\nPROS: Have had the pad thai, wide noodles w/ black bean sauce, and mango curry here. All were good. The front desk was very welcoming. Decent prices ($10- 12/dish). They also have a daily specials menu, at least for dinner.  \n\nCONS: Crab rangoon was overfried- wouldn't recommend this appetizer. Side street parking. \n\nOverall, will be back to check out the rest of the menu.	1
DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER.\n\nA hidden gem, this place is phenomenal - best Thai food I've ever had. You need to go here.	1
I agree 100% on Maggie G's review. Over priced, bad food, and Pittsburgh DOESN'T know GOOD Thai food.. Plus $40 bucks on Take out...seriously? Ill pass I've had better Thai for less. \n\nYellow Curry (Ive added a picture of exactly how watery the curry truly is ) \n(x2) Spring Rolls (2 per order)\nDumplings (5 per order) \nWontons (4/5 per order)\n_____________\n\n40 BUCKS\n\nIll stick to Bangkok Balcony. No more trying out different Thai places in the city. I rather not waste my money on watered down curries and bland dishes which seems to be the norm for the Pittsburgh Thai scene.	0
Our favorite place in Pittsburgh for Thai food! Service is excellent!!! We're kind of regulars now and we always get lucky to be served by this white guy who is awesome and polite. Their food is a little expensive but its so good. Try their tum yum veggie soup!!!! My favorite!	1
I didn't quite realize how much I love Thai Cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel. Their absence was deeply felt. Now that they are back in action, the restaurant is better than ever! It is now fully handicapped accessible, with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls. I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel, but no, they are the same. The food, also same, if not improved. The Tom Kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious. They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy. Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan (just ask about egg - veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste). And the service has always been excellent.	1
My wife and I have been coming to Thai Cuisine for many years now even though it's almost a 2.5 hours drive from our house (round trip). We both love Thai food and Thai Cuisine is still the best we've ever had (2nd best so far is in Virginia Beach, VA).\n\nTheir Pad See Ew, Three Flavor Chicken, and Thai Spring Rolls are our regular favorites. We also love having their Mango Sticky Rice for desert when it is in season.	1
blandest thai food in pittsburgh I think.  You could really just walk down a few blocks and spend less for better food.  I think the only people that like the food are vegatarians since they have fake meats.  Their sauces literally are all the same, their curries are bad, and everything is way more expensive than it should be.  Their new facade is ugly as can be too.  It looks like someone used some old floor tile from a kitchen and used it as brick for the front of the building.  Looked way better before.\nD-	0
Pretty good and decently priced for a Thai place. I was sick when I went there (the ginger tea helped me quite a bit). The wait staff was very friendly and came over to ask if we needed anything on a regular basis even though it was close to 10pm.\n\nSpicy noodles were great. We also ordered the lychee curry, which I thought was ok, but nothing too spectacular. All in all a good place for decent thai food in pittsburgh.	1
They only deliver through WheelDeliver.com	0
Oh my, Thai Cuisine, how I miss living a few blocks from you.  \nThis is my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I couldn't even begin to count the number of times that I have been to this place. I mean it when I say everything is delicious.  I have had multiple curries, noodles, and apps, and none have disappointed.\nA few of my favorites, Chicken Dumplings (steamed or fried), Thai Spring Rolls, Pad Thai (naturally), Thai Cuisine Bird Nest, and Spicy Basil Noodles.  \nService here is always on point, even when they're busy.  This place is BYOB, so bring your favorite adult bevie and enjoy. While a smaller restaurant, they happily can accommodate larger parties. \nWhile they don't deliver, you can get take out, so you can bring home a yummy Thai treat.\n\nI need to go here again asap!!! :)	1
Awesome!  We ate here several times and everything was very good.  Good service, clean place, and the noodles...	1
"If you live in Pittsburgh, you may understand how contentious the issue of \""favorite local Thai restaurants\"" is.\n\nSo, I'll begin this review w/ my personal bias: Thai Cuisine is our go-to Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. This is in part due to proximity, but the relationship is on no small part sustained through friendly staff and consistent dining experiences.\n\nThai Cuisine is -- as my wife and I like to put it --\u00a0a rainy-Sunday-evening type place. Their curry broths are great, the apps are tasty, but not too filling, and the ambiance -- particularly after their recent renovations --\u00a0is warm and inviting.\n\nI'll admit, that if your'e in it purely from a culinary angle, there may be better options, but for the buck, you won't find many that beat Thai Cuisine."	1
Excellent Thai food. The red curry, crab fried rice and Pad Thai were very good as was the seafood soup.  Service was awesome!	1
The coconut curries served in ceramic pots are all delicious. The red curry is probably my favorite. Also worth mentioning are the spicy basils stir fry, the spicy basil noodles, and the three flavor chicken. My family goes here for birthdays, Christmas Eve, and anytime we have guests in town. There isn't a bad thing in the menu. \n\nSpicy scale is 1-10: ask for the spice caddy with pickled jalape\u00f1os. \n\nPRO-TIP: Go for lunch and your entree comes with a salad w/ peanut dressing, and rice- all under 10 dollars. \n\nTalk to Lisa about what to order. She is a wonderful restrauntuer and a great lady.	1
If you're looking for straight-forward good Thai food then Thai Cuisine is the place to go. No frills, BYOB, no spa-like music simple Thai. It was quite good-I can't say it was an over the moon astounding, mind blowing, life changing experience, but it was good and what you want when you go for Thai food. \n\nMy husband had the spicy duck and it had good flavor, although more of a 5 than 7 on a 1-10 spicy scale. Really good. \n\nI had spicy noodles chillin' at my standard 7 on the 1-10 scale. I can't complain. The noodles were great and the vegetables were deliciously cooked (I tend to go vegetarian). \n\nI will say the dumplings and spring rolls we had as appetizers were a notch above what we've had elsewhere in Pitt. \n\nWe will definitely go back!	1
very delicious and good service. byob, which is a dream. love this place.	1
I will start my review by saying that I am not a Thai food expert, but I love Thai Cuisine!  My friends have a hard time talking me into trying any other Thai restaurant as I keep coming back here.  I'm hooked!	1
Been back several times and it's still our favorite Thai in Pittsburgh. The pad Thai is very good, with a slight smoky flavor that keeps you coming back for more. It's a light pad this, not thick and gloopy, so your friends who only know to eat the pad Thai (assuming you have such friends) won't feel overloaded by their dinner. \n\nI now know not to eat green curry anywhere else! Did that recently on a trip to England and was bummed.	1
The Tom Kha is delicious. All of the curry's hit the spot as well, my favorite is the red bean. Thai Cuisine has many traditional dishes as well, don't be afraid to try something you've never had before. As far as my decade of experience goes here, all of the food is good.	1
Okay Thai food, nothing special, and overpriced. Ordered the eggplant with shrimp, veggie fried rice, and chicken satay. Eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp. The veggie fried rice and chicken satay were both substandard as far as other Thai food restaurants in the area. It is pricier than most other Thai places in the area and based on the quality, I would not recommend.	0
Seems like a very nice neighborhood restaurant and bar. A bit on the expensive side for me with dinner probably in the $15 - 30 range when all is said and done.\n\nThat much said I had the Prime Rib and it was very tasty along with a simple baked potato. \n\nGood service. Plenty of parking in their own lot.	1
Great food, never had a bad meal there.  I love that they get their desserts from Signature Desserts.	1
Note the date on this review because, yes, this place used to be awesome. I keep giving it chances and now i am DONE. I just had the worst meal ever here. It is the NV salad. It used to be my favorite and i would come once a week back in the day. This salad was so nasty...they forgot the cheese...forgot the salsa and sour cream...it was disgusting. Ad the draft beer is luke warm. Not surprising it was empty when it used to be packed on friday night for dinner.	0
Very strange place. Idk what was going on but I went in around 12 pm and there are tons of young kids (5-8) running around the bar. Not a big deal just thought it odd. Got a huge plate of nachos were alright. The rest of us got assorted hoagies. Just meh sorta flavorless. And side dishes tasted as if they were made a long time ago. Good place 4 a large group to drink get apps tho.	0
I haven't been to the Getaway in a few years, and now I remember why.  Aside from my hubby, who got a burger and fries, we were all rather underwhelmed with our dishes.  Once upon a time this place used to be really good.  Now not so much.	0
This is one of those places that you really really WANT to like, especially if you live nearby.  I have been mostly underwhelmed by the food,except for their desserts which are perfection.  They have a very ambitious menu which perhaps does not give the cooks time enough to really focus on making fewer items really well. Sometimes the dinners are good, sometimes they are not. The salads are good.  I would only go there to meet a friend for a drink or attend an event that you are invited to, going there as dinner date is a real gamble, even if you do have a groupon.	0
I feef that the waitress was not trained correctly and she should never have been fired	0
Fiori's is always great pizza - especially when you're on the way home from town and hungry.  It's open late, and usually packed on the weekends.  My recommendation, however, is to go to Campitis (a few blocks away, on Potomac Ave in Dormont) if it's not too late, as they have the best pizza in Dormont.  But you'll never go wrong here, either. Quick, good pizza, and always a pleaser.	1
A south hills legend.  The only problems are a total lack of parking and long wait but a great pizza if you can be patient.	1
I have to admit, I've never physically been inside Fiori's, but I've had their pizza several times. In a word: forgettable.\n\nThe last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye. All the cheese was on half the pie. The onions were diced - an interesting choice - and I actually liked that they were raw. The green peppers seemed to have been cut willy nilly, but that's OK. It's not 5-star, it's pizza. The pizza has a sweet taste to it, and I can't can't if it's the sauce or the dough, but I suspect the former. \n\nOverall, I'd eat it again, but wouldn't go out of my way. I suspect it would be really delicious cold, for breakfast.	0
It was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat.  Stopped by Fiori's, haven't been there in years.  Yes, it was crowded but got a table and ordered pizza and wings.  \n\nThe pizza was hard to chew the crust was hard, the cheese was too!  The pizza was just sweet without much other taste, almost like ketchup!  Definitely not a fan of sweet pizza...I don't know why it is so popular but most people tend to like sweet food and drinks...but not me...I want some flavors and spice!\n\nThe wings were so average....not anything I would order again....my son ate one and said he was done...amazing!\n\nI know! I know! this place is popular, but it is just is not for me!	0
"This is Mecca... I don't know why it's so good. The sauce is really sweet, the best thing I can compare it to is spaghetti O's sauce... respectively.  But when it meets the crust and pepperoni or the \""out of this world sausage\"" ... magic happens. I would reccommend pep, sausage and onion. It's in a class of it's own. Trust me."	1
CHEESE ON CHEESE ON CHEESE ON CHEESE ON CHEESE\n\ni love fioris.	1
I've travel 52 weeks per year. I grew up in Pittsburgh, lived in Chicago for 5 years came back this year.  Been to Italy, New York...Fiori's is the best.  Sauce is great, cheese is great, service is always friendly and entertaining.  I have been going here for 20 years.	1
We ordered two pizzas and wings on a Friday night over the phone for pick up. They told us it would be ready in an hour. Sure, it's Friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable. My husband showed up an hour later and it was not ready. He had to park illegally because there is absolutely no parking available here and was very worried about the car getting hit. \n\nIt took another 45 minutes before he actually got the pizza. 1 hour and 45 mins is ridiculously long to wait! They should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed!\n\nWhen we tasted the pizza, it was... Okay. The sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland. Kinda like the pizza you'd expect from a street vendor at 3am in the South Side. \n\nWe will never be back and will remain loyal to Krazy Brothers and Molly's Pizza in dormont for now on.	0
I'm with Zachary on this one, after years of hearing about this pizza I finally tasted a slice at a steeler party. The sauce was normal, kinda sweet, garlicky, nothing special. Loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it. Knowing I don't eat meat my friends ordered me a half pizza with peppers and onions. It was still dripping with grease. I removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables. I was still kind of dumbfounded as to why this place gets raves. The crust was nothing to write home about, it was just kind of yeasty and chewy. I definitely don't see what all the fuss is. When I'm going to have a cheat day with pizza it's Beto's for me.	0
Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.	1
Best pizza in the Burgh. No doubt.	1
Their cheese pizza is a must have if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Period. It's where all the locals go and you should too!	1
There are some great pizza places in this City, and this is one of the best. Good balance of quality ingredients, and crust is consistently finished. The  small interior can get crowded at times, but the pizza is worth the minor inconvenience. Easily on par with Aiello's and Mineo's in Squirrel Hill, two of the more decorated pizza joints in Pittsburgh. Fiori's gets extra credit for using the small spicy pepperonis and always having a pinball game in the corner!	1
My girlfriend is much newer to the area so I try to take her to real Pittsburgh places. Fiori's should be held right up there next to Primanti's as a staple. South Hills icon. \n\nThere's old world charm when you order. Pie comes out quick. It's awesome deliciousness scored me many points with the lady and satisfied my soul for making my not-often-enough trip to this fantastic pizza icon of the City of Champs. \n\nPreach.	1
"Ok I'm from the southhills and realize people in Pgh have no idea what good pizza is. I assure you this place isn't it. Problem is the block heads that love this place so much just say they love it cause they are from brookline and think it's cool to say \""I love fioris\"" with a really slang sound . Hoagies are garbage and sorry but provolone cheese isn't used on a true ital pizza and sweet sauce ? Garbage !!!! After all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude. Lol this place would not last 2 weeks in New York plain and simple!!!"	0
The sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car I always wanted for a price I could afford.  Talk to Jeff and Dom they are Awesome!	1
Basically when we took our car in to see if they would look at the issues with our car they responded like a bunch of mindless monkeys with wrenches. Toyota will not take the time to find the solution to what is wrong with your car. Do not buy from Day or Rohrich, they will not care about you or whatever is wrong with your car. Also, their warranties SUCK.	0
We've been to a lot of car dealerships in the last few weeks, and this was hands-down, the worst experience of the bunch. We were first ignored, then made to sit and wait for pricing for more than 20 minutes, for no apparent reason. We will definitely not be going back.	0
This is up there in my top 5 thrift stores. While it doesn't have a lot in the way of furniture (a few pieces downstairs), it has plenty of everything else. My first visit was meant to be a short browse, but it turned into a marathon 2.5 hour shop. There were shelves and shelves of bric-a-brac to sort through, kitchen supplies galore, and so many clothes I couldn't even think about looking through them all. The only downsides were the out of control kids running around, and the constant traffic jams of shopping carts in the aisles. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place for the serious thrifter/new apartment dweller/anyone looking to kill a few hours.	1
Ahhhhh. I cut my teeth on the RW&B in the mid nineties and just revisited it for the first time since then!! I always looked for thrift stores like this in LA and SF but....hell no. \n\nWow, has she gotten a makeover: ATM in the corner, a bathroom for patrons (one that is actually somewhat clean!) and the absence of that old person-Ben-Gay smell. Prices have gone up slightly....but where else can you buy a brand new tennis racket, framed photo of Kermit the Frog (signed!) and an oversized pair of Joan Collins a la Dynasty sunglasses....true story! And knowing that half your cart is filled with items the have color tags that are HALF OFF THAT day without knowing until checkout provokes sheer joy. I was a giddy schoolgirl the whole way home.\n\nFYI- it is still cash only and the parking lot can get a little wild. Watch out for the potholes!	1
Love the store. Nice stuff. Price reasonable. BAD parking...Employees at this location are nicer and willing to help compare to the one at Ohio River Blvd....Easy check out. Friendly staff.....	0
It's a like a stampede when you enter this store! The least of the problem is the other shoppers, but the staff are gruff and unfriendly. Wasn't worth it for me.	0
Parking sucks. It smelled. They are way way overpriced!  I saw a bag priced at $15 that was apparently donated from a yard sale because it had another tag for $3!  Just really lots of junk. Also it's a cash only place but they do have an atm. Their clothes are sorted by color which is cool.	0
I've been to many thrift stores in my life and this one is definitely over priced! They are selling some items at a price that I could spend on the same item brand new! \n\nThe store closes at 6:00 which is very inconvenient for most people who work a 9-5. I had to rush to get there after work and still didn't get there until 5:45.\n\nIt is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude.\n\nI'd rather spend my money at Goodwill!	0
The food here is so good that I was ready to give It's Greek to Me a four-star review after eating takeout that had ridden halfway across Pittsburgh to meet up with me. It's a cliche to say dishes have layers of flavor, but there's no more accurate way to describe this thoughtful, absolutely delicious cooking.\n\nThe restaurant isn't fancy, but it's like eating in someone's living room, and those are some of the best restaurant meals I've had. The takeout gyro was great, with buttery pita and a potato-garlic spread that goes with frankly everything. But the souvlaki eaten in, while considering the scrapbook-worthy collection of paintings and memorabilia on the dining room walls, was sublime - a little char and a lot of flavor in every bite.  I have eaten a lot of Greek food cooked by a lot of Greek people who are very good cooks, and this stands up to any of it. Save room for the baklava, and don't share - you'll want your own piece.	1
"Very sad to find that donuts are made the day before.  I ordered three dozen donuts at about $10 a dozen, and found them to be stale and bordering on disgusting.  With all the awesome donuts in this town, why would you sell \""yesterday's donuts at today's prices?\""  Won't be returning there for any baked products as I have no idea when they may have been baked.  The woman that works at the counter is very sweet, I wanted to support this local business, sadly, I cannot."	0
Very good!  The dinning room is located in the back behind the bar.  You must get the fried zucchini!  Their breading is so light yet flavorful!  The portions for the entr\u00e9es were HUGE!  Service was great, and everyone was very friendly.	1
They make their own Pita breads here, and they make them delicious and cheap. This would be enough reason to go here, as it's hard to find tasty and fresh pitas (most of the time, the bags still have steam in them because they're so fresh) for a good price, and this is it.\n\nOn top of that, they have frozen raw gyros meat and home made tzatsiki sauce, so you can throw together a gyros sandwich. They have hummus and different kinds of olives by the pound, and a huge selection of turkish and arab foods. Some of their more interesting specialty items do get pricier, but mostly the cost is reasonable, and you can at least understand why a little box of food bought in sub-bulk from a random country in the Middle East is more expensive. \n\nDiverse, well stocked non-perishables and cheap, delicious pitas and prepared food accompaniments.	1
Pita Land has the best pitas in the city, hands down.\n\nThey also have amazing spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well, technically, they are not pepperoni rolls, but pita pepperoni rolls. Which is even better. \n\nI brought a $8 jar of tahini from Giant Eagle and came in here two days later and saw I could have brought twice as much from here for the same price. Once I finish that jar, I am coming here to buy my tahini.\n\nThey also sell gyro sandwiches for $5 on Saturdays. I haven't brought one, but I sampled one and it tasted good.	1
We've always been fans of Pita Land as a great Mediterranean grocery and the best joint in Pittsburgh to get freshly made pitas of all varieties and hummus.  When we heard they were putting in a cafe, I knew it would be good.\n\nGyros, baked flat breads, pizzas, burgers, and all kinds of Mediterranean fare do not disappoint.  Much to our own demise (wayyy too much to eat), we ordered a meat flat bread (thinking it would be small), a Gyro Doner (larger than normal), and a Lamb Burger.\n\nThe Lamb Burger, hands down, is one of the best burgers I've actually had in Pittsburgh.  Super juicy.  Cooked to order.  Feta cheese, pickled onions, etc.  I highly recommend.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get a piece of baklava from the counter on your way out as well!	1
My favourite  restaurant and bakery in  pittsburgh	1
Pita Land, olive you.\n\nI don't know why I don't come here everyday.\n\nIt's a great little market, where you can get delicious Mediterranean/Lebanese/Middle Eastern groceries. They have fresh made hummus, dips, pita bread,  you name it! And everything's reasonably priced (don't have to shell out too many leaves for my grape leaves ...) \n\nBest of all, in the last year they opened a cafe inside. It's damn delicious and cheap to boot! The gyro, lamb burger, french fries with rosemary dip, flat breads are all excellent and won't disappoint!	1
New pita caf\u00e9 is a welcome addition to a classic bakery and some of the best hummus in Pittsburgh. A great menu with fresh and local items served quickly efficiently and kicked up condiments and extras at every turn. This is the best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh bar none. Chef Greg keep it coming	1
Absofrigginamazeballs!  This place is the bomb!  Great food, friendly service and a little grocery in the side. Who could ask for more!?!  The falafel pita will astound. Yummers!	1
This place is amazing and anyone who isn't giving it 5 stars is crazy. My husband and I just moved to Brookline from NYC and when we discovered this place I felt like I struck gold. The pita is incredible...like the freshest most delicious pita I have ever had. The baba ghanoush is fantastic and smokey...omg. I could eat that every day. I had the spinach pie with feta cheese and it was yummy. My husband liked his gyro, but next time will ask for a little more sauce. Pitaland is super clean, the employees are friendly and the food is the real deal. I plan on making it one of my regular stops.	1
This time I brought my partner in culinary adventure and I ordered a Gyro and some fries.  My wife ordered a falafel plate.  She said it was the best she's ever had.  I felt the same about my Gyro.  The fries were great.  They're seasoned with something I couldn't identify and served with tartar.  Awesome.  I wish you could order a small because for $4 it's a huge basket.  Way too much for a side with a sandwich.  Miriam helped me out and I did finish them.  They were too good to waste.  I also took a square of baklava home and again it was the best I have ever had anywhere.  This place is a treasure.  If I lived near here, I would be here all the time.	1
Love this bakery! It is my favorite in Brookline and always has delightful treats and wonderful staff. \n\nJust recently bought a King Cake for Fat Tuesday, and it was by far the best I've ever had and very affordable.\n\nStop by for snack!	1
If this place is affiliated with the bakery of the same name on Beverly Rd. in Mt. Lebanon, steer clear.  Bought 5 pastries today after I managed to drag the clerk away from her socializing and the one I tasted was so stale, I took a closer look at the others. They had all be dropped quickly in a too big box with no waxed paper in between them so they had fallen over.  The icing was not damaged though as they were so stale they were hard.  I had my husband take a bite out of one and he confirmed it was bad.  We broke the others in half just to determine if any were fresh. Nope. Tossed them all and went to Prantl's.	0
owner is a terrible terrible person. tossed me out for no good reason. i found the food very average overall	0
Can this place get an order correct the 1st time? I think not!	0
You could have thought I was a child with a brand new toy last night when Darren, Mom and I stopped here for a quick bite. This is one of those revamped locations. Large flat screen TV, electric fireplace, and lounging chairs! But my greatest excitement came from the soda fountain. It is a touch screen operated dispenser. Push the button for what you want (I got diet coke), and you are given the choice of your soda alone or with one of six flavor additives. Lime, grape, orange, cherry, lemon, and raspberry! I wanted to play with each flavor, but didn't. The food quality itself honestly isn't bad for fast food. Wendy's really has improved! The burger wasn't as greasy as usual and the fries are crunchy and full of flavor! I love the sea salt! They also has a small bakery selection. Darren and I shared an Oreo brownie. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuumy!	1
Worst McDonalds!!! they took 45 min for one burger BULLSHIT!!! someone needs fired!	0
Seriously the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Service is always slow. I'm currently sitting in the parking lot right now with about 4 other cars from the drive thru that are waiting for food. If I could read my receipt (printer must be low on ink), I'd call the corporate office and tell them to fire the whole place and start over.	0
This isn't the worst McDonalds in town, at least they eventually get your order correct. But the situation inside is fairly ridiculous.  The crew during the day seems to be over a dozen employees, but they only ever have one person taking orders, and you have to wait on that person to wander back to their post to actual sell you some food.  You can see half a dozen employees in the back apparently working on cooking food, but all those people still can't get your food out in less than 10 minutes. But while you are waiting you can watching another half dozen employees at the take-out window chatting the day away while one person occasionally fills up a bag and gets an order out.	0
yummy, yummy chinese food.  thank heavens for there being one in brookline.  great food.  friendly, fast service.  decent prices.  funny kid who jumps out and tries to scare me every time i go is great in store entertainment.  very simple decore.\n\ni always walk here when i order since it so close and they always have it ready before i get there.  usually get the general tso's.  must try the other menu items someday.	1
Had the chicken kabob and hummus. Didnt enjoy either, hence, the two stars. On the other hand, the bartender was really nice. Might give a second try.	0
Lunch was outstanding! Double down with hummus and tabulee.\nWill be back for dinner soon!!	1
Worst service ever!!! We were a party of 10 had a reservation and you think they care about your reservation? Heck no!!! Waited for our table for an hour!!!! No body came check on us, we have been waiting by an empty table, no apologies, and when we ask about the table, they were really mean and rude, the hostess was not doing her job and they ended up kicking us out because they were upset how impatient we were, no.... I think anyone would be upset waiting for reservation for that long. Worst experience ever!!! Will defiantly not go there again!!	0
I'll second the other reviewer that said for the price charged, the amount of food you receive doesn't measure up. Furthermore, Pittsburgh still has yet to have any quality schawarma. \n\nI ordered both the beef and chicken schawarma to sample. \n\nThe beef:\n\n- clearly frozen boxed 'steak-ums' as opposed to freshly shaved off a doner.\n- a measly 2 slices at that, I basically had a wrap of lettuce and tomato w/ a hint of beef\n\nThe chicken:\n\n- clearly a once frozen and somewhat freezer burnt sliced chicken breast again as opposed to being freshly sliced off a doner and a mix of white and dark meat. this leaves the meat dry and tasteless. \n- maybe a half of a chicken breast if I was lucky\n\nNo toum or similar sauce served at all with either dish?!?! That's hitting a whole new low for fake schawarma. \n\nHostess was great, service was adequate. I have no motivation to return. \n\nHopefully one day Pittsburgh will have good choices when it comes to Greek and Med. food. Today is not that day.	0
Wonderful surprise in the South Hills desert of chain eateries. Romantic interior that's a refreshing throwback, and the best hummus and iced tea I had in Pittsburgh. The kebabs are sizzling, generous, and delicious, and the staff friendly.	1
Horrible, rude service.  12 minute wait for fast food?!?!	0
Sesame Inn was the place we went when we wanted Chinese food when I was growing up in Pittsburgh. My family owned a Chinese restaurant themselves and when they wanted Chinese food this is where we went. I remember the walnut chicken and the orange beef the most. What I would give to have some. The dumplings were also a favorite of mine too!! Just another place I will be sure to visit when I travel back to the Burgh.	1
Nice atmosphere, good food - Sesame Inn gets an A in my book.  The service is good - I especially like the man who has been refilling water glasses since I was in middle school and always smiles at you.  There is a room off the main dining room to support larger groups, a full bar, and a great menu.  The lunch specials are very affordable, even to high school students, and can be packed on days when school lets out early.\n\nAs far as the food goes, everything is delicious.  The hot and sour soup is great, the ma po bean curd is the best I've ever had, and even their newest offering of pad thai is pretty good.  Whether you're taking out, eating in, or having food delivered, everything here is delicious.	1
My grandmother lives in Washington, PA. Several times a year, I go to visit her and we make the trek to Sesame Inn. I absolutely love their lettuce wraps, Pad Thai, and/or Singapore Noodles. We normally share the wraps and an order of the Pad Thai. It is a huge portion. Even while sharing, we still take left overs home! Great!!!!	1
My wife and I and our son love this restaurant. Once you have Chinese food here you will select this as your top Chinese restaurant. Everyone is so friendly, the service is excellent and the food always comes nice and hot. They also have some excellent Thai specialties. I recommend the KieWan if you like Thai dishes. The amazing chicken will keep you coming back time and time again.  I cannot recommend this place enough; try it and I bet you agree.	1
If you're seeking bland, salty, Chinese food where every entree tastes exactly the same as the other...this is your place!	0
Absolutely amazing I usually don't venture out and we went to a new restaurant and I got a new dish, Capitol chicken it was truly amazing, wait staff is always there when you need them. would definitely go back!	1
The oil to sauce ratio for my Kung pao chicken was 1:1 - maybe worse.  I couldn't eat it.  I literally had to rinse it off under hot water in order to salvage a few bites.  This isn't the first time that I have had this problem here.  Takeout is gross.  I won't be back.	0
My buddy wrote to me and said I should do a review of Mark Pi's China Gate. To be completely honest, I thought I had. I checked and saw that indeed, I had not. It's been a good six months since my last visit, I remember what I ordered and how good the entire experience was.\n\nI ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and an order of bok choy which was steamed first, then quickly stir fried, delicious. The eggplant was tender, a touch of heat from chilis, garlicky, meaty and filling, served with brown rice, very nutritious. My family all ordered something different, Judy, my cousin who thinks China Gate is the finest Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, and would come here at the drop of a hat, ordered her Chicken and Green Beans. I must admit, when I did eat meat, I've had this on many occasions and it's really very good. The green beans are crisp tender, the chicken is finely ground,  moist, and tender.\n\nOver all Mark Pi's China Gate is good Chinese food, served in a nice atmosphere, and a great value for your hard earned buck.	1
NEVER EVER get the All-you-can-Eat. Hibachi plates are basically plates of panfried squash with a little meat that isn't even grilled. They give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi. It's like they are trying to stuff us full of rice and squash so we fill up quickly. Also, service was unfriendly.	0
My son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria.  We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pi's China Gate.  The food was very good.  I think it's changed hands and here's why.  We were seated and given menus.  We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later, ALL of our food was brought out.  I was shocked.  There was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast.  My son took one bite, I didn't even bother, and we called the waiter back over.  I told her I expected fresh food, not some hidden buffet that had been sitting out.  I got up to leave and she called the manager who tried to force me to pay.  I refused.  I will never go back.  There is such a thing as food too fast.  If I wanted fast food I'd have gone to Mickey D's.	0
Horrible experience!!! I wouldn't suggest this salon to my worst enemy!! \n\nSpent close to 4 hours there for highlights and a haircut!!! May of taken so long because, I was given two hair treatments... That I NEVER asked for!!!! My highlights were not even blonde.. as I asked for!!! \n\nGrossly overpriced.. Beware for the treatments given without consent!! You will be charged for them despite never asking for them!! When you call to speak to manager/owner about your $250. Negative experience... He will never return your call!!	0
I don't understand the negative reviews of this place!!  I no longer live in Pittsburgh but I loved Alberta Modern. I went to Natasha, who is so awesome. She always listened to what I wanted and I was always thrilled with what she did. Not to mention she's great to talk to and the first time I went there, we instantly bonded. As a blonde, my color can be tricky to get exactly right. I've since moved to Chicago and have not been able to find anyone I like as much and I pay three times more to get my hair done. I miss you Natasha!!!	1
One star for the unpleasant experience I have had at this store. I was treated very poorly by a particular gentleman with an unjustified ego who was working the counter. He dismissed my honest inquiry in a very rude and unprofessional manner. It seems as though he would only care to cater to the experienced musicians who enter his shop. It's a shame he could not assist me with some grace and respect. Because of him, I do not care to return to see if any other staff members are any more helpful. I will not be returning here for ANY musical needs.	0
excellent service.  really good with the kids.  the owner Joe always provides excellent service	1
Great service, quality work, good prices.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, I know... it's independently owned.  Love it!	1
This trendy little place has great pizza.  Pizza that makes you feel like you might be eating healthy because this is not a heavy pizza.  I love the slight spiciness of the sauce and the thinness of the crust.  It can be a little on the pricey side but it is worth it.  Expect lines on Friday and Saturday.  Check out the patio in the summer time.\n\n\nI used to live in Lebo and miss this place since moving to Charlotte, NC over four years ago.  I stop at Il Pizzaiolo every time I am back in town.  Charlotte really needs a place like this and the closest attempt is Brixx Pizza.  Been there a few times and the ingredients are not up to par with Il Pizzaiolo.	1
Amazing pizza. The crust is as it should be--chewy in parts, crunchy in others. The Margherita D.O.C. is always a good choice, but if you really want to travel to yum-yum land, get the Panna. With mushrooms, ham, mozzerella and a drizzle of heavy cream, it brings together flavors that seem made for each other.	1
"Il Pizzaiolo serves authentic and delicious pizza and pasta.  I highly, highly recommend eating in the \""wine bar\"" out back - where the main restaurant is loud, bright, and crowded, the wine room is darker, more romantic, and closer to the bar."	1
Probably one of the best places to eat pasta or wood-fired pizza...	1
We were so excited to try Il Pizzaiolo after hearing about it from so many people and reviews online.  We discovered after arriving that they will accept cash only until further notice.  Apparently this isn't a temporary problem because I saw the same sign on the door a few weeks ago, but assumed it was a one-night thing.  In the era of credit and debit cards being accepted everywhere (even McDonalds and 7-11) it seems inexcusable for a decent restaurant to make patrons withdraw money from an ATM before dining there.  I'm sure we will still try Il Pizzaiolo, but at the moment I'm extremely annoyed with them!  We made the sacrifce and went to Bistro 19 next door.	0
The pizza at Il Pizzaiolo was fantastic.  We ordered 3 pizzas: the Margherita, the Bianca, and the fennel sausage and rapini pizza (I forget the menu name).  My favorite was the Bianca - the ricotta cheese pushed it over the top.  The ambiance was very nice as well.  We sat in the outdoor seating in the back, which had a perfect combination of sun and shade.  The reason I gave a 4 star rating was for the somewhat slow and inattentive service.  I can't say that the service is typically like this, but we had a waitress in-service who was still learning and IMO, a bit overwhelmed.  But otherwise, I would highly recommend Il Pizzaiolo.	1
"Finally - a Pittsburgh restaurant with a decent outside patio!  Patio is in the back, so you don't get all the road noise, and is quite pleasant.  In fact, we got seated in the back corner by the fountain, which is not a normal table, but one of those stone garden tables.  Despite not being the most comfortable of seats, it was by far the most enchanting part of the patio.\n\nI thought the pizza was \""eh.\"" The dough was a little \""doughy' for my taste.  I was significantly more impressed with my pasta dish, which was incredibly delicious, but also incredibly rich, so I had to leave about half of it.  I guess that's what I get for ordering pastas with cream sauce.\n\nIn summary - a cute place for a date if you can sit outside.  I didn't find the inside half as exciting.  I'll give them another chance on the pizza, but even if you don't have that, try the pasta."	1
My wife and I like this place. It's always crowded, but you can wait in the wine bar--if that's not also packed to the brim(which it usually is). The pizza is the best in the area--exquisite crust, nice ingredients. Pricey, though. And parking is a pain. Luckily, Mt Lebo parking tickets are like $7.00, which is what you'd pay at a downtown garage anyway.	1
I almost don't want to give the secret away.  \nBest italian food I have had since going to Italy.  Simple, yet addicting. The wine bar is hidden in the back area and it is such a nice place to visit during the week.  Don't even try to go there on the weekends... too crowded.\nIn the summer, sitting outside is such a luxury.  Order the Rigatoni alla Siciliana.  Perfecto!	1
My local go-to for a great meal with friends. Always delish, fresh and well made meals, great wine, warm atmosphere. I'm lucky to have Il Pizzi a block away.	1
"The appetizer was bruschetta.  Essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings.  Two of the three were good, but the brocolinni topped one was not my taste.  Certainly, this was NOT worth the $12 price.  Our dinner was pizza.  The crust was very good - almost like a soft, warm, flat breadstick.  Sadly, the pizza was sparsely topped with cheese and sausage.\n\nOur server was attentive, almost to a fault.  The restaurant was excessively loud - we couldn't hear the waitress rattle off the soup, appetizer or entree specials (seven specials in total).\n\nWhile the food was not bad, I can't justify the prices or quantities.  In fact, I really didn't pull up Yelp to rate this restaurant...I'm actually looking for a place to go eat since I'm still famished after \""eating\"" here."	0
"\""I can only speak for the pizza, but have it on good authority that the same attention to quality, fresh ingredients is extended to the entire menu. I'll be back to sample more of everything, and to order the Margherita DOC again, and again..and again. If you're anywhere remotely close to the area, I would highly recommend a visit. If you're a pizza fanatic - it's worth making a much lengthier trek.\""\n\nfull review with pictures on my site"	1
Passing through town, tried this place bc of Yelpers. Was not disappointed, the pappardelle with sausage was awesome, pizza great, and don't forget the tiramisu!	1
Have I found my new favorite date spot? My fianc\u00e9e and I just enjoyed dinner here last night and we were thrilled with every part of our experience at Il Pizzaiolo. We showed up pretty late, around 9:20pm and were provided with quick service from a friendly server. \n\nI was pleased with their wine list- lots of great Italian reds. The Barbera d' Asti they have by the glass is excellent! We ordered the Carcuccieri pizza (or had a similar name- the one with artichokes and prosciutto) and loved every bite. Real wood-oven cooked thin crust pizza, with good quality toppings and San Marzano tomato sauce. Molto bene!\n\nWe parked on the street and were able to find a spot easily. Seemed like a pretty and safe neighborhood. When the weather is decent, dine outside on their back patio. It's gorgeous and romantic!	1
While in Pittsburgh with the hubby for a quick weekend getaway, I took Misty B.'s (@chi_mist) recommendation and tried this place out. \nCasual, but trendy, restaurant that was the perfect little date night. \nThe wine menu was good - and the server helped us pick out a few based on our tastes. \nThe food was VERY good. We had the Polpettini (mini meatballs) as an appetizer and they were all gone in about 5mins. \nWe shared two entrees: the DOC margherita pizza and a pasta special of the evening - penne with a lamb ragu. \nThe pizza... the pizza... the pizza.... I could eat the entire thing by myself. I forgot about the pasta, and to be honest, it couldn't stand up to the pizza.\n\nThis 5 star rating is absolutely for the best margherita pizza I've ever had - and thanks Misty for the awesome rec!	1
Although there are plenty of new brick oven pizza places popping up in the burgh almost monthly, this is still the best.  Robertos is the only other brick oven that compared.  Now that Roberto is in the Village, NYC this is certainly the tastiest spot left.	1
Now, this isn't the best pizza I have ever had, but it is the most authentic and that is why it is getting 5-stars.  I was craving and in search of a place where I could get the most authentic DOC style Italian pizza, and I honestly think that this place is the best I have ever had at making a certified Margarita pizza.  I cannot wait to go back: luckily, my grandma lives across the street!!	1
Delicious, up scale pizza. Not a good place for young kids. Lovely patio.	1
I have always held this place in high regard, super cute and has always been delicious but when my bf and I and a couple friends went a couple weeks ago I was extremely disappointed. I'm vegan and so is my bf so we were already limited in choices, the Napoli antipasto is awesome but our entree left much to be desired. I forget the exact name but it was basically a spaghetti w pomodoro sauce. I can't believe they charge $16 for this dish! It was cold and not a good portion. I got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip. I love spicy stuff too! Just not a good value for the $. I just moved back from nyc and my fav place there charges significantly less for significantly more. I'm so disappointed bc this was one of my go to places in Pgh! :/	0
Il piz, is a Mt lebo staple, but not that great.  We ordered the bucatini americano and a pizza.  The bucatini was good, but not a great value.  I was excited about the pizza because they cook it in a brick oven, which should make a great pie, but was disappointed when it came out soggy.  Should have been nice and crisp.  There weren't even many toppings to make it soggy.  probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices.	0
Ok...so, it's difficult to give this a star rating as I had a mixed experience. The caesar salad is one of the BEST I have ever had, but the pizza is one, if not the worst I have ever had. I ordered the margarita, sauce, cheese and basil. Well I think they may have run out of cheese and basil. It was a wet tasteless mess. I may return if craving a good caesar.	0
The wine bar in the back is one of my favorite drink spots of all time. We just visited in January, and the fireplace was going. Perfect and cozy! Good place for a conversation, but very tiny. Good for a date or catching up with a friend. It's an older and mature crowd, but because of the way it's kind of tucked away, you'll seem like you really know something if you bring a date here.\n\nThere are a good number of wines by the glass, and some good cocktails. Try the Bufala Negra (bourbon, balsamic vinegar, ginger ale, and some other ingredients I can't remember). \n\nDrinks aren't cheap, but these drinks are for sipping anyway. The bartender was sweet, too.	1
Best pizza I've eaten in Pennsylvania, the Margareta with imported tomatoes and sauce is, in itself, amazing. Everything on the menu is memorable.\n\nThis place is, however crowded and can be quite noisy and they don't take reservations.\n\nSomewhat food-allergy friendly, but no gluten-free pasta, and they could improve a bit on this.	1
I can only add to the already good reviews on Yelp. The outside area was very pleasant. The food was simply very good traditional italian. Highly recommended.	1
I visited Italy recently and when I came back I decided I wanted to try to find some similar quality Italian food here in Pittsburgh now that my standards are higher after having the real deal.  Pizzaiolo did not disappoint.  They had a pasta with an all'Amatriciana sauce I had only seen before in Italy, and I also had their lasagne bolgnese and a fresh buffalo mozzarella appetizer.  All were amazing and on par with the quality I found in Italy.  They also had a nice selection of Italian craft beers which I've never seen anywhere else in the US before.  I just wish they'd include some English descriptions of them on the menu!  All the staff there is also very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere feels more like a gourmet brick oven pizza place than a nice Italian restaurant, but they definitely have a lot more to offer than their pizza (which is also excellent).	1
Love the margherita DOC, love the dessert. Brick oven pizza is a favorite of mine. I like to try many different places & this is a favorite of mine!	1
I have tried II Pizzaiolo twice now and I am not a fan. The food was very good but over priced and the atmosphere is stuffy and very loud. If you are looking for a relaxing night out, this is not the place to go.	0
I actually really enjoy the wine bar behind the actual restaurant. Since it is considered a wine bar in that particular portion of the restaurant, I would except more wine by the glass, no matter the price. I would pay $$$$ for wine by the glass, so I know I like it and then would pay $145 for a bottle.\n\nThen there's the main restaurant that I really wasn't that impressed with. We were sat at the table with the most slant...which there were other open tables for two with No slant. Our glasses were sliding down the table so we used our silverware to stop them from sliding. No joke! The food I ordered was penne alla vodka, which was pretty tasty. But for $18, and that's all you get?! I've had better. The bread wasn't impressive, just sliced up sour dough bread with not so high end olive oil. (You can taste the difference between a really good olive oil and a bulk cheap kind). \n\nHaving said that, I will certainly return to the wine bar for maybe a glass of wine and try maybe the pizza, but not the main restaurant.	0
I always used to make sure to have dinner here during my yearly visits to Pittsburgh.\nThis will be the last time as the food was mediocre and the restaurant  looked like it was neglected. There are many new and better restaurants to choose from.\nThe sad state this once cutting edge restaurant devolved into is a real shame as it used to be one of Pittsburgh's best.	0
Favorite Italian in pittsburgh.  Good service, wait times are bearable on weekends (the wine loft makes it easy to wait).  Fantastic food - top choices are the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer, meatballs app, all pizzas, and gnocchi.  Can't go wrong with anything though.  Dinner can be pricey but worth it for such good food and quality ingredients.	1
This used to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat. However I had such horrible service here on my last outing that I will NEVER return here again. The server was rude and ungrateful. She reminded me of Lindsay Lohan filming her reality show.\n\nThe atmosphere in the wine bar is fabulous and the food is decent. I really like the pizza and marinated vegetables. The meatballs are also excellent. Sadly I cannot support a business that provides such poor service.	0
"$20 for a personal pizza with cherry tomatoes, and \""some\"" smoked Gouda. \n\nNo salad. No meat. \nNo dice. \nBetter deals and better food at a mall food court."	0
good pizza    the smoked mozzarella \n  is the best	1
First of all, Sarah was the most awesome waitress!!! Loved her wine selection suggestions, as well as dinner entree recommendations!\nThe Paccheri Alla Siciliana was a wonderful marinara sauce tossed with eggplant Fresh Bufula Mozzarella balls and was delicious! \nThe pappardelle al funghi, a delicious while wine and olive oil sauce, was tossed with pasta and shiitake mushrooms! \nBoth dishes were delicious and the amazing pure ricotta cannoli for dessert, excellent!!! \nHighly recommend this restaurant. We ate in the upstairs wine bar. But will definitely come back to sit in the beautiful courtyard garden!	1
Little Tokyo is the restaurant where I first experienced sushi, so it will always have a spot in my heart.  However, after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi, I still believe Little Tokyo is one of the best.  For one, I have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in Ohio, and they are one of my favorites.  Little Tokyo's avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent.  My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  The service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.  They will validate your garage parking for one hour, and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious.\n\nI would highly recommend Little Tokyo, especially over Sushi Two (or Three, I never can remember) on Beverly Road.	1
This is by far the best Sushi in Pittsburgh.    The food is all amazing, very fresh and authentic,  and I still compare most places I have been to Little Tokyo.  Other than that, I don't have much to say because this restaurant really speaks for itself.  \n\nWhat you wont find here:  A trendy atmosphere like Nakama ( I picked Nakama because it is also so popular in PGH), but the sushi MORE than makes up for it.	1
Awesome sushi. Nigiri sushi here is a must-try.	1
With prices this cheap,\nI expected bland sushi.\nBut hey, it's Pittsburgh.	0
I love, LOVE this place.  The sushi at this place is what I use as a basis to compare other sushi.  I had my first taste of sushi at Lil Toks which is why it has become my benchmark.  Now I will say that I have had better sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality.  Those other places that I mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion.  So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.\n\nI should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice cream...ever...even better than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  People it's seriously that good!	1
Just arrived into town & had a taste for sushi! Remembered this place's reviews & after hitting a curb, damaging the hubcap of my rental I finally made it in! I ordered my sushi usual: ginger salad, spicy tuna & sushimi Ika. The ginger salad was good, but not great...I am spoiled when it comes to ginger dressing & this was not my favorite ginger dressing. The spicy tuna was fabulous! I got 3 pieces of Ika. They were good, but not the freshest I have had. My major complaint is that I asked for a side of sirachi & instead got just a hot oil...hmmmm...	1
Very good sushi.  Enjoyed all of it.  Great salad and soup as well.  Make reservations, esp on a weekend.  The only thing we DIDN'T like was the continual (loud) birthday celebrations.	1
Let's face it,  this is not Japanese food. The food is ok but it is really more or less Chinese food. The soups taste Chinese and lack the umami quality because they are not hon-dashi based. The rice used for the sushi is totally incorrect long grain rice, and not properly vinegared.	0
Nice light and open restaurant with two dining areas and a long sushi bar.  It was crowded with many families and a few singles at the sushi bar.  Ordered several different sushi rolls and was not disappointed....fresh and presentation was good.  Our server was very attentive and helpful.  She and others stopped by to check on us and refill our drinks.	1
Love the dragon roll.	1
Love their sushi here. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. There is on street parking, and also a parking garage across the street.	1
Coming from the west coast, this is probably the worst sushi I have had in a very long time. There are no descriptions for any of the rolls. They do not offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes. Now for the food, the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops I wouldn't know). Actually, everything I ate was mushy. The service was inattentive. I waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea, after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass.	0
Food was good, very average and just a bunch of rolls - nigiri and sashimi are kinda an afterthought. I wish the menu identified the ingredients. Instead I had to ask the server (really nice lady, but definitely not quick and efficient - service was soooo slow) who kindly explained each one. I ended up choosing two and they were good, more like meh good. Since I'm from SoCal, I definitely wouldn't go here when I'm back in Pittsburgh again and would try to find another sushi joint.	0
Best spicy tuna that I've ever had.......because it's actually spicy and without the spicy (American) mayo.	1
Second best sushi in Pittsburgh after Umi. Great uni and eel. Would recommend the sushi and sashimi over other dishes here.	1
My girlfriend and I frequent this place as often as we can. Best sushi around by far. Lunch prices are awesome but you get their dinner quality of food. Favorites are probably black marlin, soft shell crab roll, yellow fun tuna, anything with eel, just about every entree and their ice cream! Oh man, I'm getting hungry typing this	1
This is amazing sushi.  I have not tried the hibachi but it is nice that they have it for dining with a mixed sushi/non sushi eating crowd.  \n\nThe sushi is spectacular and there is high attention to detail.  The miso soup is made completely from scratch, no cans.  The grated radish and other garnishes are made fresh daily.  There is no hint of staleness in anything.  The bartender is also generous in his pours.  We are never in a hurry when we go for sushi so I haven't paid too much attention to the time it takes but they always bring out the next item as we are finishing the previous.  We have frequented here for a little over a year and always leave very pleased.  \n\nFor the food quality and attention to detail the prices are also extremely reasonable.	1
OK, update time.  Sushi we split was good.  Miso soup had an odd taste this visit.\nMy main course (Butaniku) was unforgettable, a real meh!  Not sure what happened this night.  \n\nOur waitress was MIA most of the night.  Could not even find her to try to get refills, desert or our check.  \n\nMust have been an off night for everyone.	0
Some of the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Everything was really fresh and light which sushi should be, but this just seemed better. Hard to find a soft shell crab roll that the tempura is done well. This place does.	1
I did not have a good experience here tonight. We did not make reservations and got seated within 10 minutes! We were happy about that but.. Waiting for our food took so long! We were ready to walk out and just cancel the order because of the wait.. But ended up waiting it out. \nThe food turned out okay. \n\nMiso soup- needed scallions and seaweed\nSalad- the dressing wasn't gingerly enough and tasted like Italian dressing. \n- the agedashi tofu was not agedashi tofu.. It was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled Chinese chilli. Ugh.. So disappointed. \n- sushi was okay. It was just average for me. \n \nThey were definitely quick with the check and cleaning at the end! \nOverall, didn't have a good experience and food was salty for my taste. :/	0
Service can boost a mediocre meal into the the arena of excellence.  \nWhen the food is consistently above average and the service, friendly and highly personable, and the prices reasonable, then...the meal is sublime.\nI gauge a good meal by my level of desire to return.  I will visit Little Tokyo for the level 4 food...and level 5 smile they paint on my face!	1
Best pizza in the 'Burg! They definitely don't skimp on the cheese and the sauce is awesome....it has a fresh tomato taste to it that goes well with the crisp, nutty crust.	1
Stopped in for a couple quick slices of plain red sauce.  $1.60 each.  They were really great.  I loved the sauce, some of the best I have had.  I sprinkled some oregano over and it was great.  It was short of greatness, however, because of the amount of cheese.  Way too much and really hard to get down.  I would definitely go back and order a pie with 1/2 the amount of cheese and some toppings.  Some may love the cheese but I, like Darren, found it overwhelming.	1
Horrible.  Tried it several times.  Taste like frozen Pizza.  Found a hair in it the first time so against my better judgement tried it again.  I swear it was worse than my first experience.  The locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds.	0
My dad raves about this place and always encourages me to stop in. I finally gave in and stopped through one day on my way home from studying at Uptown. \nI ordered 2 slices of pepperoni to go for less than $5. I was sad that they didn't have an actual pepperoni pie; they just slapped pepperoni on the plain slices and tossed it in the over. That's my only complaint. \nWhen I got home, I was really excited to get to chewing. The bottom crust was crunchy and good (I couldn't eat the end bits of crust because it was a little hard). The pepperoni was authentic, thick, and spicy. The pizza was super greasy and cheesy, but flavorful and delicious. \nI will be trying again when I have the cash in my pocket.	1
I love Panara, I hear some bad things about management but I don't believe the rumors. Anyway, Pittsburgh is sorely missing good bagel places and Panara comes through not only with bagels, but other great, fresh bakery items. \n\nGood soups and sandwiches, being vegan I love their offerings. Good coffee too, they have a french roast that puts Starbucks to shame.	1
Needs more registers in the mornings. Mildly unorganized. But the breakfast sandwich is worth the wait.	1
I ended up at Anne Gregory because they were the only place in Pittsburgh having a trunk show with a dress I saw online and really wanted to try on.  My maid of honor maid the appointment and a couple of my bridesmaids, my mom, and grandma came with me to try the dress on.  The experience was lovely and I ended up buying the dress.  A lady was originally helping me then the owner came out a little later on.  Let me tell you....this guy knows his stuff.  He made me feel totally at ease about the purchase.  It was like being a nice restaurant and the chef coming out to check on how your meal was.  I really appreciated him being there.  I wasn't buying the most expensive dress in the place but he certainly made me feel like I was.  It was really great.  I went to a few other places and this one is definitely the best.	1
Dreadful, rude service- borderline bullies, poor selection, and they severely mark up their prices!!! Both my friend and I found a dress that they have at other stores for a fraction of the cost. Unacceptable. What a joke, really. Not at all what you want to have to endure while planning the most important outfit you'll ever wear! So upsetting!	0
Even though the baked goods are not made on the premises here - they are brought in from the main Dormont location - it smells like a bakery should.  There was so much to choose from - fresh baked bread, cookies, doughnuts, beautiful cakes, cannoli, etc.  I was even lucky enough to buy the last two paczki in the store.  One was filled with chocolate buttercream and drizzled with a chocolate glaze.  The other one was filled with whipped cream, fresh strawberries, and dusted with powdered sugar.  They were both fresh and delicious and worth the trip (although they won't be available until Feb again).  One note - we visited here once on Monday and there was basically nothing to be had in the store.  The prices are very reasonable, considering the quality of most of the baked goods.  Make sure to visit on the weekends when they are stocked to the rafters with goodies!	1
"Decent bakery in the heart of Mt. Lebo. I strolled in (literally-baby on board!) on a Tuesday afternoon for a treat after having lunch at Little Tokyo. The bakery was empty and the staff later came out after hearing the door. Young girl who seemed bothered by the fact that I was there. I asked a couple questions and got short one or two word replies. Ultimately, I couldn't pass up the gourmet brownies with peanut butter icing. There was also a raspberry version. The \""brownie\"" tasted more like a cake. Moist and delicious. The peanut butter topping was fluffy and sweet. $3.50 was a bit much for this six inch boat shaped brownie but, the rest of their cakes and cookies were reasonably priced. 30 cents per cookie. $6 and $7 pies. Overall, I will definitely head back when I am in the area. Hopefully, the staff is having a better day . . .\n\nDon't forget our cash!"	1
This theatre definitely needs a re-haul!  The theatre is older and doesn't have stadium seating or some of the better amenities that the newer theatres are offering such as an expanded menu.  While I prefer going to the theatre located closer to the South Hills Village mall, I will venture out here if the movie I want to see isn't playing there (which is rare).  \n\nThis theatre isn't as crowded, but me thinks it's b/c it's just not as nice.  I went for a movie here this weekend and there was no visual for the first 5 minutes.  We told the staff and they had to rewind the movie - which is no biggie - but the other patrons kept saying that this happens quite often at this theatre.  \n\nI think a little renovation would greatly help this establishment - if you can avoid this theatre and go with one with all the bells and whistles!	0
This is a crappy, dark theater that leaks water when it rains. Do not go!	0
Way worse than what I remember as a kid, probably because I was a kid. The screens were tiny and the women's restroom smelled of stale piss. Two-thirds of the sinks were non-functional and at least 2 stalls did not have functional locks. The staff was friendly, but the place is old, run down in appearance and a little gross. At least my feet didn't stick to the floor in the theater. \n\nIt's a movie theater. If you are already in The Galleria and want to see a movie and are willing to pay theater prices for this place, it'll suffice. Odds are, you'd get a better experience at home.	0
Such a shame. Terrific location, supported by the community and just awful. Filthy, bad seats, more expensive than others. Choose to go elsewhere.	0
This is my favorite movie theater in the South Hills area. It's been recently remodeled which makes it really nice. Located in the Galleria. \n\nSeats are huge and comfortable. Plenty of leg room and large arm rests. Overall the entire theater seemed clean, including bathrooms. \n\nAs expected, prices on candy, popcorn, drinks, etc, are of course outrageous. This theater does offer a popcorn bucket which you can buy and use for the entire year giving you a discount on future popcorn purchases.	1
Great place to catch the big game (or not so big games) while enjoying great atmosphere and prices. Staff very friendly, including the owner who went the extra mile for our group once. Little things like that keep me coming back. Good Golden Tee machine in an out-of-the-way nook. I've always met interesting people when I go to the Saloon. Food is also great. It's bar fare, but very good. Great vibe and great crowd.	1
Why does this place always smell bad? Seriously, the second you walk through the door it's vaguely sewer-ish. Their roof deck is okay, and I am honestly glad that not every establishment in Lebo is high-end, but overall I'm not a fan.	0
The Saloon is one of the best sports bars in Pittsburgh.  Tons of new TVs so you can see the game from any angle.  Sure you can go to the Southside, but then you have to deal with the zombie scene.  Seriously, that place has so many red-eyed, foaming-at-the-mouth people stumbling around it looks like George Romero is filming again.  I'd rather go to The Saloon where I can watch the Steelers/Pens in a festive, but not out of control atmosphere, and have a good time with my friends.\n\nGreat bar menu and beer selection as well.  The wings are the best in town.	1
Any place that puts Yuengling on special on Saturday night is going to get a second look from me. So I went in, and I saw the sort of popular and unassuming place that every neighborhood should have. But this was a little better. The bar has a good 15-20 taps and a huge liquor selection.\n\nI ordered the buffalo wings -- hot -- and I really liked them. They had good meat on them and the hot sauce had decent flavor to it. Seems like this place puts decent effort into quality food and drink, and the atmosphere speaks for itself.	1
"There's two saloons in the South Hills. I was confused between Cain's and The Saloon of Mt. Lebo because they're both the \""Saloon.\"" Maybe it's like the Wild Wild West and they're feuding. In any case...\n\nIf it were to that angle, I'd be hard pressed to say which one would win the shoot out. I liked Cain's because it was clean, tons of beer choices and good bar food. BUT, even though this place is a little darker, a little more \""aged\"" as I'll lovingly put it... they had some darn good wings. And beer selection. But those wings. They were crispy, the sauce was tangy and plentiful, plus it was just plain hot wings and they were delicious!\n\nSo the joint looks like it may have seen some better days... if you serve me some bangin' hot wings that are making me dream about them later and a row of around 30+ beers on tap, I'm in! I'll be back to demolish some wings..."	1
The Mt. Lebanon Saloon is such a happy hangout for my entire family. It's a perfect bar atmosphere with lots of aged dark wood and beer taps with fabulous selections lining both sides of the bar. There are plenty of TVs all around the bar and dining area - after all it is Pittsburgh! They offer up a big basket of popcorn (aka 'crack') as soon as you sit down. No one in our family can stop eating it until the basket is empty. \n\nThe wings are delicious and I wish I could say my favorite buffalo chicken sandwich was also still a delight but the last time I had it, somebody messed with the recipe and not in a good way. I sincerely hope this was a fluke and they bring back the old buffalo chicken sandwich.......please! \n\nThere's a wide array of burgers, hoagies and sandwiches to choose from on the menu that range from good to really good. It's bar food not fine dining but its always fun in there and the beer selection and atmosphere rocks!!	1
This place is just okay.  Food isn't that great.  It's kind of dark & dingy.  Lots of TV's though.  I prefer Cain's Saloon...just right down the road.	0
If you are close to the area and you simply want a cheap beer with friends on a cold night, go for it. Just don't expect to get anything else out of it. The bartenders are pretty attentive and make strong drinks but I can't say the same for the food -- it's downright disgusting. \n\nThe ambiance is a little strange. After sporting events, they blast a collection of random music that has no flow. The crowd consists mostly of guys in their late 20s who wear beanies and fedoras and like to hunt the crowd in their high school wolf packs and cougars who most likely live in the area.	0
Decent bar atmosphere with dark wood and tavern like feel to it.  Being that it is a bar, I was actually surprised by the amount of families. But, a neighborhood bar to say the least. Came on St. Patty's weekend around lunchtime which meant this place was packed wall to wall. We eventually found a high top and were able to watch both the Pitt and Pens games. They have several TVs in all different angles which is really nice when it's packed and you don't really have to worry about finding a place near one single tv or anything. \n\nIt was kind of a mess, but because it was a packed holiday weekend, I'll cut them a break. The food wasn't that good at all.. I had the Reuben sandwich and my friend had a chicken salad. Yes, it's a bar, but I've had good food at several bars before. The service was also overwhelmed and really slow. You would've been better off walking up to the bar and ordering a drink on your own. Needless to say, it wasn't a horrible experience by any means, but I wasn't impressed.	0
So this place is a smoker friendly pub, located next to Jernigan's Tobacco Village in The Galleria.  \nLooking into the pub, it looks like an olde English gentleman's study,\nwhich is why I thought it'd be fun to go here.  I had also read an article about this place that sang it's praises.  \n\nDon't bother eating here.  I think this is one of those places that only sells food so they can allow indoor smoking.\n\nService (there was ONE bartender working the entire place) Is slow, food is overpriced and poorly made.\nI ordered what was described as a vegetarian sandwich, what I got was a poorly made (and TINY) calzone.	0
At the pub/restaurant side I had a very bad experience, terrible food, even worse service.  A complete waste of money, avoid at all costs.	0
I have been going here for years to buy cigars.....even when they were upstairs in the mall. But I have always been a little skeptical about the bar(I am a drinker) and the premise under which they exist. They offered no food for sale today, and in fact a customer ordered Chinese food on his cell phone to be delivered to the pub so that he  could eat dinner. The barmaid sat at the bar the whole time I was there...smoking and chatting up her buds. Avoid at all cost. Had to ask for a drink each time, and for the check. But cigar shop is very good	0
This place would be nice in theory except for 2 very important things.  1 there service is awful, 2 there prices are awful. There are several other places a cigar smoker can go with much better service and prices. Smoke cigar lounge in collier, the oyster house in pleasant hills, castle tavern in castle shannon, chippino in the strip,level 40 in robinson etc.	0
Have a home project or problem...ask the experts at Rolliers.  They can help you fix it or they repair many things like screens and lamps.\n\nNeed seasonal lights and decorations.  Rolliers has it.  Check out the Xmas display of Studio 56 stuff!  The kids love it!  Big kids Too!\n\nGreat place to pick up items and get assistance.  Need some work cloths, Rolliers has it.  Need paint, window blinds, household items, electrical items, Rolliers has it.\n\nThe staff just assisted teaching me in how to repair a few items and help save me a ton of $'s!  \n\nPrice wise most items are competitive with other hardware places.  Sometimes a little more but the experts are worth it.	1
This is a Fantastic Hardware Store. I found a really old chrome 1930's FAN at trader jack's flea market last Sunday.\n SUPER COOL FIND !\nanyway , it had a dryrotted electric cord and a bad 3 speed pull chain type switch.\nRolliers had an exact replacement for the switch and a retro vintage looking cloth covered electric cord. I was very impressed.\nThe Staff was very helpful and happy to assist me.  ( unlike the jagoff's at lowes and home depot)\nSupport Local !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nI cant stress this enough !\nWith some advice and tip's from my favorite electronics store in Squirrel hill. \nMy fan is all cleaned up and running like a top.	1
Yes, their prices are a little high compared to competitors but there's something to be said for the local mom and pop hardware store.  You can actually get help here from people who know what they are doing....not the experience I had at the local Home Depot.  I'm grateful to have this place just around the corner and will NEVER go to the HD again.  Besides they carry some really great things you can't get at those big box stores.	1
Awesome spot with good beer, a pool table, darts, and even board games. Haven't been there when it's busy so service was always top notch.	1
Flowers for my July wedding turned out gorgeous, I'd highly recommend Mt. Lebanon Floral!  (my bouquets/centerpieces were faith roses with cream hydrangea)	1
I don't frequent the Galleria very much but go to their movie theater every once in a while.  The theater is outdated and old - you would think for their target clientele they would give the movie theater an upgrade.  The stores that I enjoy here include, Anthropologie, Williams-Sonoma and Charming Charlie.  \n\nThey also have some decent chain restaurants like Mitchells, Houlihans, Bravo and Panera if you are hungry after watching a flick.	0
This is a nice small mall. Some of my favorite shops are Anthropologie & Pottery Barn Kids. There's a Starbucks and Panera inside. No problem with parking and the mall isn't overcrowded at all.	1
"Ohhh the Galleria....  the mall where there is a 100% chance I'm going to find something I want to buy and a 0% chance I'll be able to afford it.\n\nIf I am going out for dinner and a movie though, this is where I go.  They have a great selection of restaurants there, and that movie theater.  \n\nI LOVE Anthropologie but I can neither afford nor fit into their $85 size 0 tshirts.  But I'm all about their jewelry and housewears.\n\nI always stop down at Crabtree and Evelyn, I'm so afraid this place is going to go out of business.  this store is like Bath & Body Works outrageously glamorous and wealthy elderly Aunt.  But let me tell you--their Fresh Cut Rose perfume is literally man bait.  \n\nTheres lots of parking, the mall is beautiful inside, and I do teh bulk of my xmas shopping there because I KNOW I will always be successful there, and I have all year to save up for it.\n\nSometimes they even have luxury car shows, which always makes me chuckle bc I think to myself, \""Isn't that EVERY DAY in the parking lot?\"""	1
Pittsburgh Restoration Hardware has the worst customer service ..stay away.	0
"This place SUCKS.  The pharmacist and his assistants are EXTREMELY condescending and prejudiced about older people.  My sister's friend was treated extremely horribly by these people and they never apologized, they just said \""we get a lot of elderly people in here so we often lose our patience.\""  They still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card.  If you want to be treated with respect and have competent, respectful service, DO NOT get your prescriptions here."	0
"When I was younger, my friend and I went to this CVS and started interviewing strangers on camera.  (\""Have you ever been to Alaska?\"" \""What color are your socks?\"")  We used to spray BOD all around.  We painted ourselves blue from head to toe and acted casually.  We were terrors.  They put up with us, and now I am a loyal customer in return.  I've never once had a bad experience.  I live close, so I roll on over whenever I want a new nail polish color.  As decisive as my motives are, it takes me at least a half hour to choose each time.  They have a lot of colors."	1
I have no problem with the product of the actual store but the delivery service they use is delivering the piece of furniture I got 1 week and a half after I bought (even though it was in stock at the store) on a weekday with a 4 hour time frame. I paid $125 for shipping. What a rip off, I will never buy anything from restoration hardware again.	0
I adored Uptown Coffee as a middle- and high-school student, mostly due to its proximity to the school.  It is a great, mellow place to hang out for hours.  Their drinks and desserts are always delicious, and they used to serve sandwiches.  They seem to have gone through a makeover since I graduated, and now it is much better lit, though the much-beloved couch is no longer.\nUptown Coffee is a great alternative to Starbucks and a great place to spend a few hours catching up with friends.	1
"Where else but Uptown could you get huge homemade biscotti for $2 and Hungarian-language lessons for free?  I noticed that the sugar container said \""Sugar\"", and also \""Azucar\"" (Spanish), and... \""Cukar\"".  I asked if that was Turkish.  No, said the cute guy behind the counter, that's Hungarian.  (Turkish would have been \""seker\"", I learned later.)\n\nI know only one phrase in Hungarian, I said: \""Halv\u00e1ny fogalmam sincs\"".  He smiled and said it in English: \""I have no idea.\""  A useful phrase to know, he agreed.\n\nThe coffee drinks here are simple but good.  The names are fanciful; espresso with milk and a Torani shot is an \""Elizabethan\"".  Dunking your biscotti into a good coffee, however, is an Uptown pleasure that will cost you surprisingly little -- and the sidewalk tables are a great way to add some Mt. Lebanon ambience."	1
"Weird experience.  \n\nI asked what they use for their Chai Latte and they said they have their own \""mix.\""  I'm here to tell you... I have no clue what they gave me.  I felt like it was peppermint spiced tea, with half water half steamed milk.  It was pretty gross, and wasn't even remotely close to a Chai latte. \n\nI also tried to make convo with the Barista's.  They were having none of that.  They just wanted to work, I guess.  Maybe jam to their awesome playlist, which I can definitely give them credit for.  \n\nTheir desserts and pastries looked amazing!  So I had to take home some cookies.  I chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie.  The sugar cookie was that weird crumbly kind.  I like doughy goodness.  I'm not wasting my calories on a bad cookie.  The mexican cookie was just the same consistency.  Ugh!\n\nToo bad, the place is super cute, but in my opinion it's an utter fail.  Oh wait, free internets.  Not a total loss... Sorry buds!"	0
This is a great place with good products that serves and caters to everyone.  I would miss it terribly if it was not there.	1
Mediocre sandwiches and milk shakes. Also, the woman behind the counter was very rude and had a terrible attitude.	0
This is the go-to cafe in Mt. Lebanon nowadays. There's plenty of room and the space is welcoming. \n\nThe coffee is terrific and the barista welcomes and chats with customers. The pastries and sweets are always evolving, so every time you visit there will be something new to try.	1
Great local coffee shop. I come here a few times a week to work, and the free wifi and spacious seating are much appreciated. It can get loud at times, but nothing headphones won't fix. \n\nLove their iced coffee and iced tea of the day, especially the acai green tea. The pumpkin chocolate chip bread is really moist and delicious as well.	1
Not a huge fan of their coffee, the cookies and pastries are really good, however! The lemonade is amazing. The lady who works their, is super rude and never smiles. The customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers.	0
A recent discovery of mine and I'm glad that I found it!  I loved the home-y feel of this place. There were lots of tables to work on, each with it's own individualized lamp! The artwork on the walls were fun to look at. The cup sizes for iced drinks are really big! A small is the equivalent of at least a medium (if not bigger) at a place like Starbucks. I'm lactose intolerant so I get soy milk but they don't charge me extra for it! (Usually $0.70 or more elsewhere). Parking is tricky but I always find a spot..plus the location is on a nice strip with other stores and offices so parking further down the street is worth the stroll.	1
Wish there was a choice of NO stars.  I was in this hospital for 5 very long days and it was a HORRIBLE experience.  I had a kidney infection and pneumonia and had to spend the first night in ER.  No rooms available.  There was no noise control so sleep was impossible.  Finally got a room the next day only to be kicked out because they shut the ward down over the weekend (!).  Absurd.  All I wanted was sleep - so they put me in a room full of loud visitors (I was supposed to have a private room).  Horrible experience.	0
This is a fun shoe store in a great neighborhood. Prices are reasonable. The selection is great, but they were out of my size in several shoes that I wanted to try. Service was average.	1
My first time to visit, and I hit a GREAT sale. 4 pairs of shoes for $75, and all of the shoes are very stylish. One of the employees, Brian, was very helpful! When a shoe was a little loose, he simply added some padding and the shoe fit just right. I am glad I discovered this place, and will definitely go again. Great prices, great customer service.	1
My best friend/roommate and I absolutely love this place. Last time we went in we were actually wearing shoes that we bought here and the salesman commented on that we were a walking advertisement for them. \n\nOverall, we both combined have 6 pairs of shoes from this place and so far we have gotten a lot of compliments. I bought my first pair here about a month plus ago and I still receive compliments on those pair. The prices are really not expensive for the quality you get. My friend got really nice brown boots here that look really classy for only $89. Anywhere else they would be at least $150. \n\nIf you have not tried this place out I would highly recommend it.	1
"This place offers a sliver of charm for those who shop/stroll along Walnut St. and want to drop in for an espresso. It has a big clear garage window which is always open when weather permits - and this allows for good people watching. Nevertheless, it still lacks some of the warmth and welcome that you find in other independent coffee shops. Although there are a lot of electrical outlets, this place may not be the best spot to study for a couple hours (esp. during weekend peak times). Tables can be scarce and it seems like the owner/staff are less than thrilled about a bunch of sweatshirt clad students detracting from the Walnut St. bistro-charm. If you still decide to hit the books, there is a semi-soundproof room in the back where some like to study, however it also serves as a \""community room\"" that is periodically reserved. Prices on coffee are decent, but the food and desserts are way over-priced and disappointing to the palate."	0
I was a fan for years of the Coffee Tree in spite of the lack of seating due to endless working students with laptops. I changed my mind when twice in  a row when I asked for a spare paper cup to split my coffee with my wife I was told -- we dont do that. Starbucks does and is a lot friendlier. I hate to down local companies but Coffee Roasters is acting like a franchise not a local coffee shop.	0
"Coffee Tree offers a number of different places to sit - the open coffee shop with the huge garage doors or back by the fire on the couches.  The coffee is okay, nothing special.\n\nBut if you want to sit outside without being outside this is the place.  The internet is now \""free\"" for an hour so long as you buy something and the staff will readily give you a code whenever you buy something.\n\nAs some of the other reviewers have pointed out, you may find it difficult to get a seat."	0
"I like the look of this Coffee Tree Roasters location more than anything else.  If you like people watching on a nice day, try grabbing a seat near the front of the shop, when they open up the huge glass windows.  In the winter, the coveted seating is towards the back of the shop, the couches and chairs by the fireplace.  The meeting room in the back is handy, but I've found it to be really chilly in the winter--not sure how it is in other seasons.\n\nThe coffee's all right, and I feel \""meh\"" about the hot chocolate and chai.  While the baked goods in the case look tempting, I haven't been wowed.  One person I went with got a biscotti, which was rock hard--now, biscotti's supposed to be crispy, but not that hard.  When she told the baristas, they informed her that the biscotti was supposed to be that way (didn't she know any better?).  At best, I've found the service here to be civil, not friendly."	0
i must admit that i'm shocked at the poor reviews for this coffee tree roasters location.  though i don't spend time in the store, i always grab an espresso or latte whenever i'm in shadyside.  i absolutely love their beans.  i even buy their whole beans to brew at home.	1
i love this place!!!!!! \n it is a pretty big cafe shop,and they also have a small room for study discussions and they also have this open place,for people who would like to breathe some fresh air and see people walking outside the street.\n\n  I could actually sit outside all day sipping the amazing coffee and dunking their yummy walnut or dark chocolate biscotti .And wooo what makes me love this place more??They have amazingly cute stickers to stick it on your coffee cup.\n\n   And yes!! i do enjoy cheap thrills like ,taking a sticker which reads GOBBLE GOBBLE and sticking it on my friends forehead.hahah\ni did laugh for about 2 minutes. But sadly my friends was definitely not edible ! \n\n   A great cafe shop in an amazing location and filled with good memories.i love you coffee tree!!\n*imagines herself hugging a huge tree which bears coffee beans on it* :)\n\n-Smriti	1
The vanilla lattes are a little sweet, but delicious. This place is perfect when the weather is nice and they can open the garage door. It's definitely a must-visit coffee shop on Walnut.	1
I love coffee and any place that serves it. Shadyside is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city, especially on a Saturday afternoon. It's very alive and animated with people everywhere! I personally love window shopping at the Apple Store, but that's a different story. \n\nMy girlfriends and I met on Saturday for a little shopping and lunch, and while we were waiting for our one friend, we hopped into the Coffee Tree for a morning tea. They have an awesome tea selection, and I had their organic citrus green tea. The layout is great inside - a lot of tables, and outlets for the laptop users. Up one level, they have couches by a fireplace, and finally in the back they have a closed-in meeting room available for groups. Great location - great tea. It was perfect for the brisk, sunny Saturday morning walk down Walnut.	1
I dunno, I've been here enough times to review the place, but there's not really a whole lot to say.  It's a coffee shop! I never sit in and hang out, I always just stop by for a cup, and usually I go to Jitters instead ::shrug::\n\nI'd have to say that they serve you pretty quickly, though, which is good because it's always hella busy in there!  The big open storefront thing is great on a nice day.  I suppose if the Coffee Tree had a selling point, that'd be it.	1
My go to study spot.  I've enjoyed the regular coffee, ice teas, and biscotti. Decent amount of electrical outlets which is crucial to my sad existence as a PC user.\n\nOpen until midnight everyday if I'm not mistaken which is heaven for a stressed out grad student.\n\nGreat for hitting the books while being able to take study breaks to people watch. On nice days, the whole front opens as it is a garage door offering an awesome feel.\n\nStaff has always been polite and doesn't seem to mind students hogging tables for hours upon hours. \n\nActually, as I write this review I realize this may be my favorite coffee house ever.	1
In the summer or early fall, it's a great place to hang out as the windows are open and you can feel the nice breeze.  The service is pretty good and took my order quickly as well as serve it promptly.  The prices are competitive and the muffin was fresh.  Despite being busy, it did not feel overcrowded with their 2 levels of seating.\n\nI also ordered a bag of beans.  They had a vast selection of beans at very good quality and had no problem with a coarse grind for my french press.  Overall, a very solid place for coffee and baked goods.	1
This was my official neighborhood coffee shop while I lived right down the road on Walnut for 3 years. It's located right in the heart of Shadyside, and while some of the patrons are typical uppity Shadyside residents, the staff are very laid back and very cool. It's a big venue for a coffee shop, with a down stairs area with beautiful exposed brick and large opening windows that are great in the summer months, and also an upstairs area with many tables, a fireplace with sofas, and even a back private room people can rent out. The coffee and pastries have always been pretty good. One complaint I would have is (I don't know if they still do this) you could only have Wifi access for two hours with the purchase of an item. I understand the need for this, but if you plan to work here for most of the day you have to keep refilling or buying other items on the menu. I usually stop in when I'm shopping around Shadyside and miss it now that I've moved out of the neighborhood.  Also a great place for meeting with friends or a casual date.	1

I have recently become a coffee shop bum (and my reviews are beginning to reflect this) but I enjoy this place. It definitely is busy (which is a good sign) but can be difficult to find a comfortable seat. The drinks are great and the staff is really friendly. \n\nTheir late hours are ideal for students or those that just run better late at night. The fireplace and quiet room are cool additions to an already pretty neat space. \n\nThe only thing I wish was a bit better was the wifi situation - luckily I was able to get a bunch done without the need for it. Definitely going to keep coming back here and enjoying the space/drinks!	1
OMG. Mr. Barista. Your not in Seattle. I Live Pacific Northwest.  I'm not a coffee snob I can do with it or without it. But it seemed like I was absolutely bothering the staff this morning. Check the date.  Ordered mocha and a scone.  And got a look.  I'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear. Felt like I was in someone else's hood.  Get over yourselves people.  Your in Pittsburgh.	0
I've taken my laundry to the Laundry Factory a couple of times now.  They are always prompt and do a good job at taking care with your clothes.  The place is surprisingly clean and bright for a laundromat.\n\nAs Zoe mentioned the prices are very reasonable and you won't find a cleaner place anywhere near Shadyside.  Another plus, when I needed somethings turned around quickly they were more than willing to accommodate me, for no extra charge.	1
i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning.  they outsource the dry cleaning and didn't really make recommendations on any of my garmets.  i've gone to cleaners before that will tell me to wash over dry clean or startch, ect.  to top it all off the place didn't have my garmets back the day they said they would.  so, i had to make another trip across town to pick them up.  where are the $1.95 per garmet dry cleaning shops in pittsburgh?  this place is out of my dry cleaning budget!	0
They lost 2 of my shirts and a pair of my jeans - they were also EXTREMELY rude when I tried to find my stuff and did not offer any help.\n\nThey are unreasonably expensive as well\n\nDO NOT GO HERE - THE HIGH RANKINGS ARE FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES!	0
as much as i would rather have a washer/dryer in my apartment, this place makes it bearable to go to a laundromat! excellent reasons to do your wash here:\n\n - the air conditioning is pumping! it's well over 90 degrees today, and frankly i wish i had more laundry so i could stay\n- free WiFi (which i'm using right now!)\n- kitschy decor (yes, it has decor!)\n- clean, working, updated machines\n- two fully loaded change machines!\n- friendly staff!\n\ni'm hooked and definitely coming back here.	1
the staff is super friendly. I drop off laundry for my business and they do a great job. And yes, they are so much cleaner than any of the other places in Pittsburgh that I have used.	1
Clean very clean present people $2.10 for shirts and I hate doing launder at a mat but if I have to then I will do it hear.  It's worth the extra buck to do it some where thats clean has WiFi a tv for the game and is right next to a bottle shop and a bar. Ok everything is stainless.	1
If i could give this place less than one star I would.  First, the place is a mess.  Second, the washers are some of the most expensive I've found in the city.  But most important - they have NO RESTROOMS!  What kind of place sends their customers a block down the street to a coffee shop to use the restroom?  This was my first AND LAST time at this joint.	0
i'm a total fan of eons. love their selection! a little pricey though.	1
You want style?  You want selection?  You want clothes that have been respectfully honored for the wearable vintage art they are?  Go here!!!  The owner Richard is top-notch and knows his stuff inside and out.   My only regret is that I didn't have more days to visit...maybe that good thing, because honestly, I don't think I would have left the store.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd be making weekly (maybe even daily) journeys to the store.\nI'm an experienced vintage shopper and baby - it doesn't get better than this!  And the prices - very reasonable for the quality of the clothing, which is all cleaned and tenderly loved.	1
Meticulously organized and a great selection. Definitely worth a stop.	1
Good selection, well organized, friendly staff!  \n\nOn my quest to explore Pittsburgh, I stopped by Eons and ended up trying on a few things.  I wasn't really on a quest to find anything though, but I could see myself spending hours in there shuffling through all the racks.	1
"This place defines \""vintage clothing shop\"". It's small, packed, and well organized. You must stop in here, even if you don't think you want vintage clothing. You will. The selection is amazing, and the staff could not be more helpful."	1
I went here once when I first moved to Pittsburgh. My shirts came back poorly pressed and some had broken buttons. I was disappointed.	0
I went here once to get my pants hemmed and got yelled at for not purchasing proper pants in the first place. I was too startled to respond but have since thought of many  witty replies. Oh well.	0
Do not use this cleaner.  Quality is poor. They ruined three shirts of mine, tore two of them and shrunk another down. Refused to replace them or compensate me for the loss. They do not stand by their mistakes.	0
Have been waiting for +10 business shirts and suits for over 2 weeks. The manager is uncertain whether my clothes will be ready in another week or two. \n\nThe last batch of dry cleaning came back pressed with wrinkles. Had to send it back. \n\nCustomer service is poor. \n\nI would strongly recommend you not use Owen's Dry Cleaners.	0
This place is terrible.  Customer service is sub-par.  I took 10 shirts in on a saturday.  They were supposed to be ready on the following thursday, 5 days later.  I went to pick them up on monday, NINE days later and they still weren't done.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I have a card to have 5 shirts laundered for free and i'm throwing it away.	0
Soba is Big Burrito's take on Asian fusion.  As with everything concerning Big Burrito, Soba is excellent in all departments.  It is next door to Umi (Big Burrito's sushi place) in a trendier area of Shadyside.\n\nThe space is elegant--a waterfall adorns the interior.  Lighting is dark as is the decor--as with most Big Burrito establishments.  There is plenty of space between tables and such--you can take a date here and you should.\n\nThe food is excellent.  Dishes are inventive (not your normal Asian fusion dishes here) and well presented.  The quality of the ingredients is top-notch (my tuna tar tare tasted very fresh).  As a note, tasting menus are not available--two specials seemed to offered every night.  The menu seems to change by season as well.\n\nSoba's wine and whiskey selection is extensive--10 pages for wine, 4 for whiskey.  The service is excellent, as is to be expected.  Really, everything here is great.  You should go at least once, Soba is a gem in the rough of the Pittsburgh dining scene.	1
Been coming to this restaurant for years, before the fire that caused the entire renovation of the place you now go to.   Obviously, I like the food, good quality, a perfect serving size, and the amuse bouche is a nice touch!  The wine selection by the glass is pretty decent.  Service is always great.\n\nThe bar area is fun and definitely a place for young professionals out for a drink, to hang, and to meet others.  At night, for the late-night menu, you can even get a few selections made from their neighbors, Umi!	1
THE place that I went for a nice conversation + cocktail combo in the 'burgh. Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. Ahh, Soba. If only all Pittsburgh restaurants could be like you, the world would be a better place.	1
Only went there once -- it's nice, but not so rave-worthy as other reviews might imply except in comparison to the other offerings in Pittsburgh. Food was good but IIRC, the portions are small -- you end up spending a lot of money in order to feel moderately full. Drinks are good.	1
I don't see the big deal about Soba Lounge. I thought the food was only okay, and I didn't like all of the flavors overpowering each other. The ambience is really nice, and the servers are friendly, but the food was just alright for me.	0
"First a warning, the parking lot will most likely be full, because it's not just for Soba. See a parking space on the street? Take it.\n\nSoba is a beautiful restaurant and lives up to the Big restaurant group expectations of unique flavors. The sushi is great, but if it was anything less than great I'd be worried about Soba. The grilled salmon was cooked perfectly with a wonderful coconut Thai sauce. The staff is very courteous, but I had a creeping feeling they were all \""egh a bunch of 22 year olds just walked in and they don't belong here.\""\n\nWe'll have to come back for drinks and dessert one day."	1
Finally went to this restaurant, now I understand the hype!  I loved what I had ordered.  The Thai corn chowder is awesome -so flavorful.  The flat bread with hummus - delicious (the hummus had a citrus taste to it).  The avocado maki roll was also great.  Service was excellent.  We sat outside on the balcony - beautiful and comfortable.	1
"Over the past 4 years or so, my rating for Soba has regularly swung between 3-4 stars. Because my experiences during recent visits have been positive, I am hoping that the 4 stars will stick this time.\n\nOne of Soba's consistent strengths is its ambiance. It offers a swank, contemporary atmosphere (and, unsurprisingly, with an Asian feel). The lighting is soft and pleasing -- great for romantic dinners, but still appropriate for business meals as well. \n\nThe menu also reflects a contemporary but Asian influenced theme. The dishes are a little less innovative than Tamari's, but they are generally well thought-out and well prepared. I especially recommend the beef short ribs (strong and complex flavors) and the fillet mignon (super tender and juicy). The kitchen sometimes seem to have temperature control problems. I have had disappointing seared tunas (over done) and on a recent visit, my \""medium rare\"" fillet would probably be considered \""very rare\"" by most restaurants in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe dessert is overpriced, but I have a special soft spot for the perennial chocolate maki."	1
This is a good restaurant, one of the best Big Burrito spots... love the small plates and the idea of being able to grab a drink at some small bites in the bar. The pork dumplings and the the vinegar sauce... to die for!!!  They have a nice happy hour M-F as well.  Good cocktails.\n\nI think many entrees are overpriced, but they are good.  But $24 for a chicken ramen dish... I still get it because it's excellent, but even restaurants in San Francisco and NYC don't charge this much for such a dish.  The Bronzini dish is always excellent and they try to add a few other tasty specials in from time to time... but in my opinion the menu doesn't change too often.  It's a good place to go when you want to get exactly what you want... meaning, whatever you had on the menu last time will probably still be on the menu.	1
I have always bee a fan of the big burrito restaurants. My boyfriend and i have been there 4 times and each time it has been amazing. the decor is excellent and its dark and even romantic. they also have a hip bar with couches and they open it up during the summer\nDuring certain holidays they have the chefs tasting  menu which has 4 courses. My boyfriend got that during their thanksgiving special and he LOVED IT!!!!! \n I have gotten the spinach and mushroom dumplings as a starter  a couple of times and they were amazing the pepper dipping sauce was soo delicious. for my entree i got the red curry tofu and the flavors were amazing. it was very filling and all the vegetables blended well. for desert i got the caramel bomb and it was DELISH!!!! \nI ve had the vegetarian pad thai on a different occasion and that was pretty amazing too. They dont have too many vegetarian options i kind of wish they did.  \nThey have a great wine and cocktail selection too. \nFor non vegetarians the chefs tasting options they have every once in a while are amazing!!	1
So underwhelming. I've been here a few times and have always been disappointed. Last night the service was especially lackluster. And the kitchen closed and 10, so no snacks for us later in the evening . They do make a good French Martini though.	0
I can't stress how incredible the Big Burrito group is. They deserve prizes.\n\nI came to Soba with two friends for the Oc Om Boc festival, and was pleased to order and eat the price-fixed ($35) four-course meal they offered. Delicious pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, duck confit, duck breast, noodles, beef and rice, fresh vegetables, and an incredible dessert of cake with a hint of banana (and a vanilla wafer).\n\nThe lights were turned low, there was a wall with running water streaming down from the top, and there was some contemporary playlist in the background playing all of your NPR favorites (David Gray, Radiohead). As an added bonus, the paper towels in the bathroom were EXCELLENT--I felt so guilty wiping my hands on them and throwing them away.\n\nThe menu is a bit pricey, but I don't think I'm experienced enough to judge its price vs. the food...I'm just a pretty broke college student who spends all of his expendable income on nice places like Soba.	1
So the majority of my food was good here, appetizer (King Edward Mussels), dessert (sorbet) but the main course I ordered: soba noodle was horrible. It was way to salty which overwhelmed all other flavours.  Normally I would give a place a second chance, but this is soba we are talking about the namesake of the restaurant.  For this price, I would expect excellent food and great atmosphere which this place has failed to deliver.	0
If you are like me, and adore espresso martini's, you must check out Soba on Ellsworth Avenue! The martini is made of chilled espresso, vanilla vodka and Kahlua coffee liqueur. \n\nBy far the best espresso martini in the city!\n\nThey also have an excellent food menu for both the bar and restaurant.  They have happy hour specials and the bar is always filled with a great crowd!\n\nSoba is affiliated with the Big Burrito chain, along with Eleven, Kaya, Casbah and Umi: all of which are excellent restaurants!	1
Get a martini\nOr anything else they have\nThis place is heaven\n\n\n(b)	1
I give this place an OKAY because I've had mixed experiences. The first time I went it was okay, but was very forgettable.\n\nThe last time I went, we were seated outside on the balcony, and the outdoor heating was nice, our waiter was polite and well spoken. The only thing was that our food took... forever... to come. When we asked about the status of our order, the food came right away.\n\nIn terms of food, they have a pretty good selection, but... once again forgettable. It's a nice and casual place to go but don't expect more.	0
Last night was the first time I went to Soba and I LOVED it! My friends and I got some tables in the lounge area and it was the perfect setting for a quiet Saturday night catching up with friends. The whole place has such a great vibe, the service was awesome, and the drinks were dee-lish! I can't wait to go back and have dinner there.	1
I was so disappointed with the quality... the salad was drenched in vinegar, the duck was mediocre.  I guess I'm used to really good food from foodie towns.  If I wanted mediocre food, I would go to fridays or olive garden-- was it comparable?  Yes, for quality of food.  The price, obviously, was much more.  This fake fusion place would have gone out of business, regardless of price, if it had to compete with the likes of Slanted Door or was located in a city with good food.  If this is representative of the best Pittburgh has to offer, then take the money you would have spent here and reinvest it in a trip to SF or NYC and eat well for a week. How sad is that?  Don't go here... you pay $30 for an entree, $10 for an appetizer, and $15 for a mediocre wine.  Not worth it...	0
Awesome service, food very good, but a tad salty for my taste. Great ambiance!	1
What a lovely, intimate, upscale restaurant! A nice surprise by my boo on a Wednesday night was going to Soba for dinner. We didn't have reservations but there was some seating available and we opted to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous.  I have never been here before and was really impressed with the decor! The outside seating area was my favorite part of the whole dining experience. Comfortable chairs, lights strung across the ceiling, the most pleasant breeze and a view of the sky (which at the time was a mix of pinks and reds). \n\nBoo and I split an appetizer (the mushroom, spinach dumplings) and the pad thai entree. Both were fantastic as was the service. Love it!	1
Went here for my husband's birthday and they have a very nice outdoor seating area. I wasn't a huge fan but my husband loved it and compared it to being on the same scale as Eleven so that's why it gets a 4 star rating. \n\nWe ordered the korean barbeque ribs $12) which fell off the bone and the calamari with chilies, toasted garlic, mint and an uni emulsion ($9). \n\nMy husband had the seared rare tuna - sesame crust, korean bbq, kim chi, cucumber-red onion  salad, ginger fried rice and peanuts ($34) which he loved. I had the spicy basil noodles with broccoli, onion, button mushrooms, baby bok choy, orange peel, sesame seeds and fried egg ($17). I ordered it spicy but found it to have a strange taste. \n\nFor dessert we had the frozen cashew terrine which had chocolate ganahce, mango-rasberry coulis and candied cashews for $8.	1
I would prefer to leave 2.5 stars.  I ordered the kimchi pancakes and a salad I think.  The pancakes were ok, a little mushy but flavorful.  I wish I could remember the other thing, but it was better.  \n\nThe kicker was when I ordered a glass of Laphroaig.  When the bill comes, it is 75 dollars.  Apparently the only Laphroaig they have is 30 years old and no longer being produced.  And is 50 dollars a glass.  Drinking Scotch in Pittsburgh has been fun so far.	0
"Soba is usually my pick to use my free entree coupon from the Big Burrito restaurant group and there's a reason I keep going back. It's fantastic! It's a bit pricey, but not stuffy or pretentious at all. Their food menu changes daily and takes advantage of local and seasonal ingredients, but if they ever get rid of the Chocolate Pretzel Stack desert, they might have a mutiny on their hands! Their recent remodel really opened up the space, yet it still feels very cozy. The servers are always friendly and attentive and I've never had a bad experience here. Definitely a great \""special occasion\"" or romantic restaurant."	1
Excellent food. They did a great job with the renovation- the place is swank!	1
Soba is great! The food is delicious, and sometimes (positively) surprising. For example, their mashed potatoes have an asian twist to them and are a little bit spicy! I like the atmosphere, interior and the service has always been great.	1
Went to Soba to celebrate my sons birthday. Quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price. We have eaten there several times in the past but not sure that we will be going back anytime soon.	0
The crab meat corn-chowder appetizer is the finest appetizer I have ever had in my life. I have been to most of the great restaurants in New York City over the past 30 years, and that statement stands.\n\nJust fabulous.	1
Soba had become one of our regular spots for big family dinners. Most recently we came for my sisters birthday. I was able to get reservations for 7 at the last minute for Saturday night. We had a long table next to the waterfall on the first floor. It was a high top so it wasn't the most comfortable but for a last minute reservation it worked.\n\nWe started with the calamari which was delicious and then dived right into entrees. I had what I always get- the seared tuna. It's crusted with sesame seeds and comes with rice, BBQ sauce, Kim chee, and pickled vegetable. It's so delicious I never get anything else. I had bits of my moms duck which was also delicious and the boyfriends sea bass was amaze! \n\nWe did not stay for dessert at this visit but in the past I have enjoyed the ice cream with cashew dessert. Soba is really so good. And it looks to beautiful.	1
Food is very good, not outstanding and they are  pretentious. They seem to be very New York like in terms of seating trendy looking people in the front and parking the Bentley's ou front with lots of orange cones. \n\nOne of the six of us got the wrong dish, but she ate it. Turns out to have been the best dish.	1
We have been regulars at Soba for years, sharing a few appetizers at the bar-lounge on a quiet evening and enjoying the food. Last night was different. For the very first time the food was awful.  A scallion pancake replaced the kimchee pancake. The chef, who we learned was new, obviously had no idea that a pancake is the glue that holds a tasty morsel together. This was pure glue, tasteless and sticky. Where was the content, the taste, the flavor? The lump-crab egg roll was worthy of a corner take-out Chinese eatery, oily mostly. A pulled pork appetizer was passable, nowhere near the dish it replaced. find a new chef quickly.\nJohn E. Raffie.	0
I'm the first person to stick my nose up at Asian fusion, but hot dang, I had a wonderful meal here. \n\nHamachi sashimi appetizer - Delectable! Raw fish paired with avocado and an interesting garlic sauce for a bit of salt. Yum yum yum. \n\nKorean barbecue ribs - Fall off the bone. Unbelievably tender. \n\nSeared rare tuna - Almost 2 inches thick, and totally rare on the inside, with a crust of sesame seeds. Brilliant idea. Kimchi on the side for a flavor punch, and ginger fried rice was tasty too. \n\nAmbiance was contemporary, intimate, and cozy. Dark lighting sets the mood for a date, but I came here with family and still loved it. Upstairs patio was a bit muggy in the summer, but has nice views.	1
Food was okay. Service okay. A bit expensive for the quality of food served. Thai corn soup jumbo crab??? Good lucking finding a piece of crab meat.  Pad Thai at a fusion place? Not good at all...Better go to a real thai restaurant for pad Thai. Tandoori Salmon was average. I still don't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm.  A cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda?  Why weren't their any ice in the glass? Who drinks sodas at room temperature. This restaurant maybe was trying to be too fancy and forgot the basics of ICE.  Maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas. Overall it is okay, but not justified by the price.	0
One of my all time favorite restaurants. Has gone through a couple of face lifts with the most recent being the best. The bar side, where I go almost every time is much more comfortable and cooler than before. \n\nThe drinks. I think they have a pretty decent cocktail and wine list. They are very well made and although expensive, pretty generous. Really like Laura the bartender. She is solid. The beers on tap are minimal and pretty safe bets with a few more to chose from by the bottle, but not a beer snob Mecca. \n\nThe food. I really enjoy places that spotlight small plates allowing you to try many things. I can't remember a small plate I did not like and can remember a few I wish would come back.....uhhh soft shells...  Usuall don't go for an entree but my wife and I split the filet one unadventurous night and it was delicious and very cleverly done. \n\nIt is expensive but very high quality and It's a great place to come alone, as a couple or a group. One of BB's gems.	1
Amazing Two Fish Tempura Fat Roll...one of the best things I've tasted, seriously.\nExcellent Thai Corn Chowder.\nIncredible Black Cod.\nThis place does Asian Fusion well!	1
A great salon experience in Pittsburgh. Johnnie was fab and trimmed my hair exactly to my liking. Highly recommended!	1
Went to this place with my friends. Everything we had was amazing. The appetizers were delicious. This is what I ordered:\n1. Miso Soup: Was awesome!!!! very flavorful. My only complaint is there wasn't enough Wakame for my likening. But over all, it was AWESOME!!\n \n1. Black cod with Miso: This fish was cooked perfectly and literally melted in the mouth. The flavor was mild and perfect.\n \n2. Tuna Tataki: This was slices of Ahi Tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare in the inside. It was to die for!!!\n \n3. Shrimp and Asparagus Maki roll: Probably not a great choice to begin with, this was okay, nothing to rave about.\n \n4. Fuji Maki Roll: This had Crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside. It was delicious!!!\n \n5. My friend had the assorted Sashimi. The serving was huge so i got to try some of his stuff. The white tuna was delicious as was the salmon.	1
This place has the absolute best food I've ever eaten, not just in the sushi category.  My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and both had the omikase. We both love sushi and both agree that this was hands down the best sushi and Japanese food we ever had. BUT, the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the portion size. I was perfectly happy with the portion size but my boyfriend was not. I think the disappointment came more from his expectation of 7 courses of an American meal. I, however, was expecting portions smaller than the typical American meal. \n\nThe restaurant is pricey, but if you love sushi you have to go. The sauces perfectly complement the fish. The shrimp was absolutely perfectly cooked. The food itself is to die for and worth the price, just don't go expecting American size portions.	1
"I used to go to Chaya in Squirrel Hill at least once a week, but since I've moved this past summer, it's been difficult to enjoy sushi as frequently.  Thus, I decided to test out Umi based on the good reviews I found on the web.  Sadly, I was grossly disappointed.  The interior decor is pretentious (large water fountain in the middle of the dining room and \""Japanese style\"" paintings and decorations throughout) and dark (who likes eating in a place where you can barely see your food?).  The sushi was okay at best, but the quality of the fish certainly does not even come close to Chaya's.  The dishes were overpriced for the quality of the food, basically you'd be paying for the fake ambiance.  I guess the waiter was nice in that he tried to explain our dishes, but frankly he does not know too much.  This is one of those Americanized versions of an Asian restaurant and not authentic (key indicator: most of the patrons were not Asian).  It was nothing that would make me want to come back."	0
This is the real deal...in Pittsburgh. Don't expect flop down for a casual California roll here. They take the sushi and the experience very seriously. The downside is that it you'll never be satisfied with average sushi again.\n\nPro tip: make reservations days in advance.	1
According to the Pittsburgh Magazine, this is supposedly one of the best 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh. Clearly they have never been out of their city, county or state. I suggest they take a trip to Philly and try some of the good Japanese food. Regardless, the snapper/fluke/yellowtail yuzu jalape\u00f1o is a nice touch, but not a must try. Service is sketchy here at best.	0
I had some pretty high expectations for Umi, since it claimed to be the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Those expectations kind of fell flat.\n\nService here on a Saturday night was atrocious.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink and then another 20 min before we were asked what we would like to order.  Not OK.  On top of that, our interactions with our waiter were just awkward.  Something seemed to be up, like there was some tension going on with him and maybe the staff/kitchen?  \n\nAs far as the sushi goes... it's pretty good.  I got some maki rolls, which were very good, but nothing spectacular.  Miso soup... OK.  Salad was OK.  \n\nThe sashimi definitely seemed like a better option and something they took greater pride in.  The people next to us who had ordered some sashimi options and seemed quite satisfied.  If I come back again, I'll make sure to order sashimi.  However, I was so annoyed by the lack of service that I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.	0
Very fresh sushi and great atmosphere. The chef gave us complimentary appetizers and desserts, but we gladly gave the house more business by ordering tasty sushi and drinks.	1
i've been to Umi for sushi several times and haven't been disappointed in the quality of the fish.  yes, it's delicious and high quality food.. so why the four stars you ask? \n\nbecause it's just a bit too pretentious for my taste.  yes, it's great quality fish and yes, the decor is very traditionally beautiful japanese... but what you read about the snobbery is true... 50$pp minimum @ the sushi bar? please.  \n\ni agree with a previous reviewer, it's beautiful, high quality food and service... but i always leave feeling like something is missing.	1
One of the best Sushi experience I had so far. I was on a short visit to Pittsburgh and looking for a good sushi joint for dinner, went by the yelp reviews and as always it was a good experience. \n\nI tried their sushi (assorted) which comes with soup and salad. Soup and salad were amazing to start with and sushi combination was pretty good. Overall with couple of drinks it costed me 50$ but it was worthwhile i would say\n\nService was very professional and attentive, and the overall ambience was awesome.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good sushi.	1
Date & Time of Visit:  May 21, Dinnertime\n\nI don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar, eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover, the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom, only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes, there was urine on the floor.	0
Went to Umi last night on a first date.  The wine was delicious, had two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc, and ordered 4 rolls to share.  Spicy Tuna was delicious, there was no spicy mayo, but it didn't even need it.  The spicy softshell crab roll was amazing and i stuffed it into my mouth as usual because its a larger sized sushi.  The most delicious was the Eel and cucumber roll.  The other was the green fuji, this was different and delicious.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate covered pretzel and it was out of this world.  Chocolate mousse, chocolate salty pretzel rounds stacked on top of each other with caramel drizzled over the entire thing.  I'd go back just for dessert.  I'd also like to try some entrees but we were there just for sushi.\n\nWill definitely go again.	1
My favorite sushi in the city of Pittsburgh. I gave 4 stars and not 5 due to cost $$$$! We try to eat here at least 3 to 4 times a year. The sushi is the freshest and most tasteful. I lived in Los Angeles for 8 years and was spoiled the sushi restaurants. \n\nI have introduced numerous friends to sushi at Umi that had never eaten Sushi before and now they love it. I have brought friends who thought their local place was good and I said that I am a sushi snob. Once they tried Umi they understood what I meant and how better their sushi was. \n\nTry the spaghetti squid  along with the miso crusted black cod.	1
Excellent cocktail menu first of all, followed by an excting dinner menu that has not failed yet. Sushi has always been fresh and perfectly presented. I've made this a regular on my dining rotation.	1
Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase. Like the tatami mat seating as well.	1
This used to be our favorite place when we first moved to Pittsburgh two years ago.  It had good quality fish and a nice atmosphere/cool staff.  As of our last visit, about two months, ago, the menu still had not changed, the portions of fish were smaller while prices stayed the same, and the atmosphere was on par with that of a Hofbrauhaus.  A drunken man knocked into our table on his way storming out of the restaurant which was immediately proceeded by the members of two different large tables rising from their chairs and yelling obscenities at each other.  It literally looked like there was going to be a brawl.  The members of these tables fairly quickly left the restaurant; however, the staff and manager simply acted as if nothing had happened.  No one came by to see if things had spilled on our table which was run into.  It was absolutely not the experience we expected to have, and it is a disappointment that this place has gone downhill.	0
Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced	0
I'm very surprised at the quantity of low reviews for this place, as I think it has the best sushi in the city and is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Yes, it is pricey but I think it's safe to assume that the quality and freshness of fish here is a little bit higher than the stuff you see at your local Giant  Eagle.  \n\nI definitely suggest trying the Wasabi Tobiko ($4 per piece).  Such a unique piece of sushi, and one of the reasons I've been counting down the days until my next visit to Umi.	1
Exquisite!!	1
Lots of options. The sandwiches are moderately priced and good. Avoid the cupcakes - they are dry.	1
"It is rather unfortunate that Pittsburgh doesn't have ANY privately owned strictly bagel joints. Bagels, in my opinion, are one of the best breakfast alternatives to actually sitting down to a nice breakfast. I want this - being a student, basically full-time server, volunteering - my life pretty much requires a bagel breakfast every now and then. However, I'm in Pittsburgh, where can I go?\nEisteins? Brueggers? These place are virtually the same. Panera? I used to work here so not only do I dislike the taste, but I have a natural aversion to eating anything from this place. \nBagel Factory! Yes! No...these bagels are about the same you would get anywhere. Just as chewy, that taste of \""this is feigning fresh because it is warm and was just heated up, but it's definitely not fresh fresh.\""\nSadly, this is what Pittsburghers must settle for. I we can hope for is that one day a kind Philadelphian or New Yorker will show us the light, and bring us light, fluffy bagels of my dreams!"	0
Best bagels in Pittsburgh. It reminds me of the bagel shops I grew up with on Long Island. \n\nThe bagels are appropriately chewy, and they've got a great selection. I've had a bunch of different types (salt, everything, sesame) and they were all delicious. They also have a selection of desserts and other foods.	1
I am not sure what makes a perfect bagel but after eating at Bagel Factory I am pretty sure I am darn well close to it. Don't let the drab decor of the store fool you. Bagel Factory churns out delicious perfections of bakery like no one's business and we were told that the Penguins get their bagels from here too so we know we are in the right place. I've ordered the lox sandwich, and egg ham and cheese sandwich - both on everything bagels. The lox I think is my favorite and I'd love to come back to try a Cinnamon one. Soft and fluffy with a bit of crunch. Watch out, you'll find this tasty bit gone within seconds.	1
"The food at this location was about the same as at the Squirrel Hill location on Forbes Avenue (not bad, not great), but I thought the service was far worse. One of the male employees helping us referred to one of the females as an \""old hag\"" which I thought was extremely unprofessional and uncool. I'm sure he was joking, but that's still not something he should have said around customers. This tainted the whole experience for me and I probably won't be returning. My dining partner agreed."	0
Don't come here from NYC looking for a good bagel and lox, stick w the ice cream.	0
Okay bagels though a little overpriced. Been to squirrel hill location and Ellsworth location once each. Have consistently had rude customer service. Really turns me off. Won't be going back even though the bagels are okay.	0
I'm not totally sure why I keep going back here. The place is tiny and dirty. It was super busy and only 2 employees were making food. The owner was on the register but kept leaving to do other things because they were so short-staffed. I felt bad for how overwhelmed the staff must have been, but they worked as fast as they could. \n\nThe food's okay and overpriced. The coffee's terrible. The seating area is crowded. The location on Craig street has had mice and roaches. \n\nThere aren't many bagel places in Pittsburgh, but Brueggers and Einstein's win.	0
Unfortunately, there are basically no bagel options on the east end of Pittsburgh, so we were forced to come here a few times. The food is decent and there is a large variety of bagels. However, the last few times we've come here the service has been terrible. The man working at the cash registrar at the end was shouting at his employees from across the room and made fun of us for using a Groupon. After we got our food and realized that one of our sandwiches didn't have cheese on it (which we ordered) we proceeded to tell the man at the registrar and he responded by accusing us of lying and charging us an extra .80 Cents for a slice of cheese. Unreal.. save your money and go somewhere else.	0
"Don't frequent this business unless you want to be treated very badly. I was subjected to the rudest, most passive aggresive behavior I have ever experienced. Alison made it clear that my job was too small for them to be bothered with, and I understood, but she was disrespectful about it. Fine. I left. Then an installer called to tell me she was sending him to my house. So I went in to choose tile, and Alison was impatient and angry. The installer came. Then I went back  to the store for a third time to buy the tile , only to be told \""I should shop at Lowes\"". Why would a business drive customers away and then pull them back and then insult them and refuse to do business?  I told Alison she had a terrible attitude, and she said \""I know\"".  Something is very wrong with this place!  The employees here should stand on their feet at Lowes for a day and learn to be polite to customers....shame on them!"	0
Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar, but good luck getting served.  If it is crowded or the bar is just full I've always had to wait to get served.\n\nThe beer selection is decent, but not all that big.  For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road.\n\nThe best part is the patio, if you want decent food and good outdoor seating, Harris is a good choice - if you don't mind waiting.	0
"only a stupid, spoiled, new york shiksa such as myself would order something on the menu called a latke at a place like this (\""the boxty\"").  it was disgusting and didnt resemble any latke i have ever seen.  \n\nlucky me, i had about 4 bloody marys during the hour wait for my table so I was full anyway."	0
My go to spot when I just want to relax with some friends.  Great drinks and craft beer selection is coupled with very good food.  Make sure to checkout the lounge upstairs during those cold winter months.  During the summer grab a seat on either the front patio for people watching, or the back patio for a nice quiet and private drink.  Good brunch turns great once the patios are closed, as the brunch buffet becomes a la carte.  This brings about the Breakfast Smil... err, Simile.  Home fries, bacon, sausage, eggs, and pancakes all on one giant plate.	1
good food.\ngood drinks.\ngood patio.\nGREAT urinal.	1
This place just bored me.\nReally don't know what to say.\nBored, bored, bored, bored, bored.	0
It's a good thing Harris Grill has good beer and Bacon Night since otherwise you wouldn't have anything to occupy you for the 45 minutes to an hour it takes to get food on your table from the point in time that you order.  FYI - definitely order that last round of drinks (plus an additional one) as you ask for your bill since the poor service doesn't stop when the food actually gets to your table.  I wrote HG off the first time I went there, then gave them a second chance after a friend asked me.  Guess what my final assessment is.	0
Being an outsider to Pittsburgh, I wasn't expecting much before we walked into Harris Grill. As soon as we entered, it was clear that this place had a lot more ambiance. \n\nThe Pro's:\n- The menu is funny.\n- There are a fair number of vegetarian options which are clearly labeled\n- The onion rings are amazing.\n- The portions are large, you can get more than you fill for a good price\n- They have root beer floats!\n- Our server was hilarious, you know that self-deprecating kind of humor\n\nThe Con's:\n- There were a lot of items that had run out\n- The service was a bit slow...it took forever for that root beer float to come out.\n\nOverall, I'd come back!	1
Appearance is best\nThe drinks and food don't live up\nTo expectations.\n\n\n(b)	0
The fact that this place has a bacon night has impressed me for years.  I would receive fat-smudged pages of letters written at this bar, the samples of Dogfish head dripped onto dog-eared corners for me to scratch, sniff, and lick at my discretion.\n\nThe men's room alone is a reflection I would leave unchanged in my description of this place.  The orange/yellow urinal and the sink are shaped in the Rolling Stone's mouth logo.\n\nNext time I visit Pittsburgh I will do brunch there with friends,	1
Completely surprised by this place! The drinks were good, strong & cheap. The food was excellent. For 3 vodka drinks, 2 beers, chicken & veggie quesadillas and mini burgers, we paid $35. Cute, dark, little place with outside seating. We sat at the bar. Got great service!	1
harris grill, i think  your menu is trying too hard.\n\nfirst place i went on my visit to pittsburgh.  menu was a little overly silly, waitress was a little underly friendly/helpful/timely, and food, while decent, was overpriced for the quality.\n\ni may be back to pittsburgh, but won't be back to harris grill	0
I don't really have a good review for this place. It's not that the place isn't good it's just that I don't have an accurate experience to recount.\n\nI went for bacon night. This is on Tuesdays.\n\nI saw an outside patio on my way in. On a nice day, that area seems...nice.\n\nBut the happy hour was good. And once the bacon started it kept flowing. So by far this was the best part. \n\nOh, so while I would have usually given this place 3 stars for simply existing and providing me free bacon, I knocked it down due to the really inept barstaff. I spent way too long at the bar before being acknowledged to order a drink.\n\nYeesh. Too bad I wasn't as cute as one of those girls at the end of the bar.	0
Two words: Bacon. Night. \n\nYes! Do not adjust your screen, you read right. They have a bacon night here. \nContain yourself! It happens on Tuesdays!\n\nI started coming here when I lived in the area a few years back, and it still has it's charm. I try to make it out for Bacon Night whenever I am in town. The other food is good too, so don't overlook it. \n\nAs for drinks, well, I became knowns as a mojito abuser overnight because of this place, and I don't care who knows it.	1
"Meh.  The Harris Grill is one more American business in a long line to have great ideas ruined by terrible execution.  An entire page of delicious looking burgers?  Bland and overcooked.  Cool looking spaces?  Can get cramped and awkward with groups, and sometimes it's hard to get a server or bartender to notice you (I've never once thought a group outing here was anywhere approaching \""comfortable\"").  And what about the famed BACON NIGHT?  It's not even good bacon!\n\nThey'll have to knock their game up several notches to achieve the potential contained in their great ideas."	0
Overcharged $19 and having a food order messed up twice, what more could you ask for? A waitress that doesn't seem to care about any of this? Wish granted!\n\nSo yeah, my food was pretty bland, though my girlfriend said her food was OK overall. Overpriced for what it really was.\n\nI may have come back if it wasn't for the first two items. Instead I'll leave them as a shining failure to customer service.	0
This place has changed.  Just a couple of years ago, you could count on Harris for good food, good drinks, dependable service, and a great atmosphere.  Those days seem like a distant memory now.  \n\nMy wife and I went for dinner on Sunday (3/11/12).  That was a huge mistake.  The food was just bad.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  The fries were burnt and cold, the slaw was wilted, and the sandwich was mediocre at best.  The worst part was that it took 45 minutes to prepare.  If you're going to serve bad food, why does it take so long to make it? This was topped off by a waitress who never bothered to stop back to check on our drinks. \n\nI was really shocked by how bad everything was there.  I have such fond memories of the place from just a few years ago....  There are too many other nice options in Shady Side to waste one's time at this dump.	0
Best vegetarian chili on the planet! \n\nI love their pierogies.  The menu is unique and diverse.  Alcohol selection is great too!	1
"A pleasant enough little place for \""Hipster Yinzers\"" to engage in those unique conversations where everyone talks simultaneously and loudly and no one is heard. The fare is somewhat overpriced for minuscule drinks, meager portions and lackluster service.  Oddly, everyone seems to rave about their tater tots......yeah, the same processed frozen spud you enjoyed in elementary/parochial school."	0
"Just around the corner from my work, me and a few coworkers came looking for some play!  We went early and got a cush spot on the top floor with the window.  Clearly it's a hot spot in the neighborhood because it was packed by 7 pm on a Tuesday?!  The outside seating area was buzzing even in the chilly fall weather.  \n\nThe first quenching sip of that half-price RASPBERRY COSMO and I was sold!  Add on some true \""Pittsburgh\"" food (I'm talking about putting fries in a salad, oh yes!) and other yummy munchies like a super stuffed chicken quesadilla and our fun time was complete!"	1
I have nothing good to say about this place. I've been here on several occasions over the years and here's what I have observed:\n\n1- If the place is crowded (which it almost always is) expect terrible service from your waiter/bartender. Waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu.\n\n2- The food will be overpriced/sub par. On one occasion me and my entire party got food poisoning from their fried calamari\n\n3- You will be seated somewhere awkward/uncomfortable. The interior is cool looking but not functional, gets very congested when there are big crowds. \n\nThere are plenty of other bar/restaurant destinations in Pittsburgh that can deliver and execute the same idea in a much better way. Avoid Harris Grill.	0
This place offers really poor service. The waitstaff go out of their way to not help you. This has happened to many people I know multiple times. We put up with it so we could get the brunch. We stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter. He was flat out rude and upset my friend so we left and won't be coming back. The food isn't that great (the tacos/fajitas are terrible and flavorless, as is the salad), the drinks are grossly overpriced, and the service as I mentioned before is slow and inept. \n\nOn the plus side the brunch is great (it just ended because of winter), the food is relatively well-priced and the location is great (if you can find parking). I recommend going elsewhere though because it just isn't worth being treated so poorly by the staff. Management should take note.	0
I am giving Harris 4 stars because it is my neighborhood bar and has sentimental value to me. Minus that, it is probably a 3.5. They have a stellar frozen cosmo but the rest of the drink menu is just okay. Their food menu is a hit or miss. Their turkey burger and mac'n'cheese are great but the rest is probably just okay. Their desserts are unimpressive and it is hard to underwhelm me when it comes to sugar. So I would say, go for the atmosphere and the cosmo but not for much more.	1
"I've visited Harris's Grill a few times over the past 3 - 4 years and every time I leave I ask myself \""Why do people love this  place so much!?\"" The food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best. Minus the bacon gimmicks and pretentious Shadyside vibe... This place is an average bar/restaurant."	0
I had a great time.  great food and cocktails.  exciting ambiance, not for a quiet night out.  but who wants that? :)	1
Came here with a party of 5 others for brunch at 11am on a Sunday. We were seated immediately but were surprised to learn that there is no brunch buffet during the winter.\n\nMy eggs benedict was good, so was my bloody mary. Don't expect vegetables and meat to go together here--they are mutually exclusive options on this menu. That said, I counted only 3 dishes with any vegetables at all. The coffee was disappointing--it came with plastic cups of half & half. Any respectable restaurant should do better.\n\nOverall, the food is good, heavy, and served in decent-sized portions. I would come here again although there are certainly better venues for brunch in the city.	0
Disclaimer: This review is only for their Sunday brunch. Wasn't impressed by their Sunday brunch. Didn't like the presentation of the buffet. It was in a small area and felt kind of cramped. The salad was made with iceberg lettuce and didn't look appetizing. My friends ordered orange juice and each glass was filled to the brim with large pieces of ice, which means that they really just had maybe 1/2 a glass of orange juice. In all, it's really nothing special, just very basic. It was my first time eating at Harris Grill. What seems nice is the patio and if the weather had been nice, we would've sat outside and maybe I would've given it an extra star.	0
The place is good for drinking but definitely not to have a meal. There're not much options on the menu. \nI tried the pasta once and it was tasteless.	0
Went for the first time today. Kitchen was just wrapping up a re-model, but they extended happy hour to accommodate and the food was pretty darn good.\n\nThe happy hour specials were a great deal and the staff was really nice. Also love that the patio is in the shade all afternoon/evening. Great summer spot.	1
I LOVE this place. Here's why...\n\n1.The service is awesome. Hostess jokes while seating you. Awesome. Server knows his shit and rocks at presenting it. Gave us a rundown of the highs and lows of the menu. If he didn't know about something (like a beer we asked about) he went, grabbed samples and came back fully knowledgable on them. \n\n2. The outdoor seating is baller. They have a back area that is no smoking so you don't have to get a whiff of smoke in your face while enjoying the weather and eating. They also have creative seating upstairs. Awesome.\n\n3. The food is DELISH! Try the rib tacos. They are sooooooo good. I've never had a bad meal here.\n\n4. They have a sense of humor. Menu is fun to read.\n\nBeers also aren't overpriced. WIN.	1
Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.	1
"I normally avoid brunch buffets as a rule; the food is never up to par and it's a cattle call. Usually a poor excuse for restaurants to make money. However, when a local friend suggested we meet here he insisted Harris Grill's brunch was legit. He had me at \""bacon trough\"".\n\nNice patio seating and friendly service! You get a frozen mimosa (and it's not overly sweet or weak; actually tastes like a frozen mimosa) or bloody mary with the $15 all you can eat brunch. Omelets made to order, lox and mini bagels, fresh fruit, trough of well done, really quality bacon as previously mentioned. There's even pre-assembled eggs benedict, which I expected to be a mess but they were perfect. \n\nI wish all brunch buffets were like this. It is a tiny bit cramped when there are several people loading up plates, but everyone was understanding and laughed off the occasional bumps. Brunch is serious business, you do what you gotta do."	1
I don't understand why this place is so popular.  I've been there 4 times and each time the food was pretty gross.  Most recently, I ordered a Del Monico sandwich and the thing was dripping with oil.  The beer list is decent.	0
Great service, great food, great drinks.	1
I'm a longtime fan of the Harris Grill so please note that my review is specific to brunch only.  My friends and I were lucky enough to get patio seating on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. That was the highlight of brunch- friends and the patio. \n\nThe only option for brunch is to get the buffet. They were packed and couldn't keep enough food out.  The Mac and Cheese, while cheesily delicious was cold. They kept running out of plates. They never had the salmon when I went up- yet I saw it on other patrons plates.  And, insult to injury, my Bloody Mary was watered down. My friend had a Bloody Mary and the olive in it tasted like chlorine. \n\nI will give props to the guy making the omelets.  He had all the ingredients, was quick, and friendly. \n\nLike I said, I'm a big Harris Grill fan and will be back again - just not for brunch.	0
Holy lord Mac and cheese with pulled pork and chili. Very good man drinks, very good lady drinks. Food service and staff. I like that they don't take reservations. Nice outdoor seating area.	1
Great atmosphere, good food, and lots of unique cocktails. The patio is very pleasant in the summer.	1
"stopped in the Harris Grille last night after doctor visit. Doug our server was fantastic, he was very knowledgeble on all the menu items. he could list the make up of every item. very impressive. they had a unique and interesting list of foods. Both of us had superior Bloody Mary's. I had a carnitas (pulled pork sand) on a pretzel roll with the best Gazpacho I've ever tasted. Wife had a great Flat Iron on Mac & Cheese, very, very  good. We sat in the \""Mural Room\"" trying to interpret the mural with Doug. very interesting. U must go and enjoy this unique grille. It's a fun place in a cool part of PGH."	1
I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!\n\nWe went to Harris Grill for lunch, we ordered some entree and calamari for appetizer. It was calamari on top of some salad with Thai chili sauce dressing. Just when we almost finished the calamari, I found one entire cigaret in the salad. CIGARET!!!! I have no idea how a cigaret can be in the salad. IT IS JUST DISGUSTING. We left without having the resting of the food.	0
Harris Grill is a restaurant in a house that looks like The Addams Family's home, but it doesn't mean you should be afraid to eat there.\n \nYou can either sit out front or hide away in the inside OR sit at the bar with giant TV's that usually have on something more interesting than the latest game, sometimes Discovery Channel or Animal Planet.\n\nThe food is a little pricey but the quality justifies the cost.  The mac and cheese is amazing and made fresh there.  The presentation and plating felt high end but the place is very casual.\n\nRumor is Tuesday night is all you can eat bacon night, I'll have to make it for that.  If you go or it's another day, let me know!\n\nTellem HITTofMCM sent ya!	1
With the wealth of breakfast and brunch offerings in the Pittsburgh area, it's great to go to one that isn't snubbing it's nose at the rest of the crowd. We were riding around, trying to find a place that didn't have a 4 day wait and would satisfy a monstrous appetite. And of all the brunch places in all the world, this one came walking into my life.\n\nHere's the deal that can't be beat: an unlimited Breakfast buffet with smoked salmon, eggs Benedict, an omelet station, and a frozen mimosa for $15. That's right kids! Add to that the great selection of beers and cocktails and you may need to move in. I was so satiated that I didn't eat another meal the rest of the day.\n\nThe bonus was that there was great outdoor seating so we could participate in some obligatory people-watching.\n\nNext time I am back in this great town, I will definitely be hitting this place up again. I just need to see where I can purchase one of those additional stomachs and an extra-stretchy pair of pajama jeans.	1
Great evening. \nBasics:\nGreat service, \nVery good food..hamburger Helper ( not like I remembered )\nVery good beer with pumpkin for my wife and met with her approval!\nDesert ...homemade cookie with Ice cream and whipped cream was perfect\nCheers	1
Very tasty!  Casual, nice, medium sized bar.  \n\nGreat bloody mary.  Very, very good.  The bartender even made us an off menu blue cheese, bacon, and egg bloody mary which was just insane basically.  \n\nThe Jerk Chicken Mac n Cheese was very good too.  Spicy, spiral noodles in a lightish cheese sauce.  Not super decadent but that's good because it was a HUGE portion.  Everything everyone in our group got looked pretty good.  \n\nSlightly expensive for what it was but whatevs.	1
I came here with a few friends today for a late lunch after a race. The service was quick and very friendly.  We ordered Totchos (tater tot nachos) to start and they were delicious! The buffalo chicken dip disappeared within minutes as it was better than any buffallo chicken dip any of us have had at a restaurant.  The seasonal cocktail menu was also great- I had the rum spiced cider and a pumpkin pie cocktail.  To top it off, one of the people in our group has a severe nut/bean allergy, and the entire staff was very accommodating in making sure no nuts or beans touched our food. Will come back again for sure.	1
I stay 2 blocks away from Harris Grill. I have been to shiloh's grill as well, a caouple of times. Harris Grill used to make awesome food an year ago..now its just boiled vegetablea..steak cut out for you..who would want that!!!!	0
PSA: there is a groupon for this place that is valid until May 2015!\n\nBurger was good. Mac and cheese was a little salty and not very warm but it wasn't terrible. Cookies and cream dessert was super yummy. \n\nService was very attentive and we went on a Saturday night. \n\nKinda dim and loud in there...it is a bar after all, and there is some interesting religious art work on the walls.	1
"I really liked this place!!  The atmosphere is inviting and cozy.  We ate upstairs at the table facing the window and it was a nice spot to relax and people watch. It looked like they had other cozy group seating arrangements up on the second floor too.  Our waiter was really nice and attentive.  \n\nThe menu is great.  Not so much that you get lost, but covers enough for everyone's taste....and it's full of jokes and hilarious descriptions.  Lots of comfort food, and tasty twists on classics.  They have a huge drink menu (...more like book) with lots of creative originals.\n\nI had the Cajun chicken mac special (the dish may have actually been titled \""Imagine the Rastabilities\"").  The serving was huge, and the mac was awesome.  It was a bit too spicy for me, but that's just my taste and I think it was a really cozy meal."	1
I LOVE Hey Betty!  It is such a fun place to simply browse!  I warn you though, you could blow your entire paycheck here.  I play bass in a band (unfortunately, we're not as active as we once were) and most of the time I wear, well, whatever.  Every so often though, I like to wear vintage clothing that I've bought here!\n\nThe collection here is certainly eclectic enough.  They also have vintage accessories too.    They have retro jeans, but I'm really more into vintage dresses and costume jewelry.  They also have retro tee-shirts (and not the ones you can get at Target, either).  My brother once bought a Pittsburgh Gladiators T-shirt and a Pittsburgh Pirhanas jersey here.\n\nSo this is the place to be in Shadyside when you want vintage.  Prepare to empty your wallet here!	1
Although Hey Betty pales in comparison to Eons, it's still one of the best vintage stores in Pittsburgh. The place is small and narrow, but has several floors, so it's bigger than it actually seems.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the selection is sometimes limited (mostly '60s-'70s), but what's for sale is unique and quality, and definitely well-priced.  I once bought a leather bomber jacket from the '70s for $30!  I tend to like their accessories more than their clothing: they have an amazing selection of footwear, ties/bowties, hats, jewelry, gloves and handbags on the cheap.  Hey Betty is such a fun place, and definitely worth a visit if you love vintage!	1
Hey betty I need a poodle skirt to go with my new bangs..... or a pink mohair cardigan to match my beehive hairdo. \n\nOr.... a twenties shiffon blouse to make my bonnie and clyde outfit for halloween. No problem found it here complete with its own glass buttons. The owner was helpful in showing me where I could try it on and offered to let me look at items in the cases. \n\nCute little shop more women's clothing then mens. The owner was chatty with me or clerk whichever she was. There are two vintage stores in this area so you can check one then the other if you don't find what you're seeking on the first try...	1
I love this gym everybody there is soooooo nice and helpful	1
I love this gym. The equipment is kept up-to-date. The classes are fun with very energetic and helpful instructors (Bodypump is my favorite).\n\nThey don't supply towels, but the gyms I've been to usually charge extra for a towel fee so I always brought my own, making this a non-issue for me unlike some people.\n\nThe only negative is the lack of parking, but that happens all over Pittsburgh so I'm not surprised. \n\nA huge plus is the staff. They are all super friendly. I recently started having sessions with a personal trainer, and I have seen a DRASTIC improvement in my fitness based on the exercises he has me do. Before I couldn't even hold a plank for 60 seconds. Now he has me using bosu balls and other nifty toys to make different exercises more difficult without piling up a whole lot of weight (weak shoulders).\n\nOverall, I love XShadyside. Unfortunately, I am moving back home (cancellation process was no hassle at all like I've read on here!), but I will definitely miss having a gym like this.	1
I have been a member for a year. Pretty crowded, lot of machines that do not work and not open all time during week ends. Obviously, compared to a $10 membership at Planet Fitness, the choice is quick ... The reason you would stick to this gym is the classes. If you want a spin class or a yoga class, it coul dbe worth it. If you are only looking for treadmill and machines, membership cost is not worth it.	0
This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \n\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area.	0
This place is great. We stayed 2 nights and had a very good stay. The room was very clean and comfortable - you basically get your own apartment, which makes for a very relaxing stay. The service is great - they give you muffins, coffee and juice when you check in for your room. Location is great also. We stayed in the back building which was only two blocks from the very cool Walnut Street shopping district. \n\nOverall I'd absolutely stay there again. The only downside was that the heat in the room was up pretty high and we couldn't figure out how to turn the heat down (no room controls). Otherwise a great & very reasonably priced place to stay.	1
Great location but low on amenities.  HVAC system is ancient and the noise factor on Fifth Avenue is problematic. The price is nice but that's all I can say about the positive.	0
Once a year for the past 10+ years we've been staying here.  You canNOT beat the location.  You can walk to shops and restaurants and the area is safe.  The staff has always been above average.  A few years ago the rooms were rundown but since they have renovated and the rooms couldn't be better.  A hotel doesn't give you that much room - you literally have your our own apartment.  I was there last week because a family member died.  We were having relatives visit us at Shadyside Inn and the staff went out of their way to deliver chairs to our rooms.  Our rooms were cleaned every day and there are very few places that allow dogs - and they do!  Their prices are reasonable and I wouldn't stay anywhere else while in PA.  Thank you Shadyside!	1
I'm granting one star because there's no way to give none.\n\nAs I write this, the door to my room is open, and two burly gentlemen are drilling and hammering and drilling and hammering--I just checked, and it's going to go on all day. Evidently, the inn is installing a new lock system, and for some reason it was impossible to wait until I checked out later today. Counting on solitude and quiet, I'd brought work to do, but it's now utterly impossible to concentrate. I stayed here once before and loved it, but this lack of concern and respect sets a a new low.	0
We stayed at the Shadyside Inn for months and spent thousands of dollars. I really wanted to write a good review, but the experience was disappointing. \n\nThe quality of service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude. When we provided feedback to the manager (Carol S.), she was extremely disrespectful. She was not receptive to customer feedback at all, and her response was very unprofessional, to say the least. \n\nWe also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall).  And the elevator did not work at times.\n\nWe will not stay at this hotel again.	0
Nothing special about this place. Great location but the facilities are a little tired.	0
I am in mood. I am reminiscing about my favorite haunts in the burgh. I live in los angeles, one of the tastiest restaurant havens in the world. And yet, i left part of my stomach in pittsburgh. \n\nI loved the calamari for a starter, the talapia in a sweet nutty white sauce, and the apple crisp for dessert. those were just my favs, but i did try other things, everything YUMMY. cool atmosphere and cocktails as well. \n\nFrom my understanding this place has been around a long time, doing their thing. Check it out!	1
Comfortable place that is our most frequent and favorite dining spot......if Norm and Cliff ever moved to Pittsburgh, this is where they would hang...........we like all of their food! Finding a place to park is my only complaint.	1
Came here for dinner on my birthday (back before I turned 21) and also when my parents were in town for dinner.  The food was decent each time, but nothing really standout.  I enjoyed my fish and chips, but my boyfriend didn't care much for his pasta--too rich and overwhelming.  I like the homey decor a lot, though!  It really feels like a neighborhood place.  Coming from the suburbs, I'd never seen restaurants done like that (except tacky imitations).\n\nLuckily for students and other carfree residents, it's on the 71C route and close to the 71A!	1
I've been here twice and I'm just not crazy about it.  Nothing is BAD, per se, just not really impressive.  The service is fine and the food is certainly edible, but missing something - at least, their vegetarian food.  When I ordered sweet potato fries, a lot of them came out burnt.  The Big Green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks.  Their French onion soup was pretty good, but when is French onion soup not good?  They have a hot vegetarian sandwich, but it sounds gross.  Does hot hummus and alfalfa sprouts sound good to you?  As for non-vegetarian food, my dad was very satisfied with his hot grilled chicken salad.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back for brunch.  Since it's just around the corner from my new apartment, I'm sure I'll end up going here with my parents fairly often.  I'm not crazy about it, but if they're paying, I'm not opposed to it.	0
Been there twice in the last year.  The service was mediocre once, and embarrassingly bad the second time.  The food is good; it's Meatloaf-Centric American.  It's a place you'd take your conservative parents.\n\nThat said, the first time I was in, some of the regular customers were being ridiculously outgoing about politics, and decided to group-hate some things I find pretty reasonable.  Didn't seem reasonable to argue with a large group of folks in their regular spot, so, ah, that's that.\n\nIf you can't find plain-to-upscale American food in Pittsburgh, you're really not looking very hard.  Reading another review, I'd be baffled trying to figure out why anyone would take the bus here.	0
Extensive wine menu and average service.  They have an in-house wine specialist that helps you with your wine selection - impressive. The food is the high point of this place. They always seem to have a great selection of seasonal foods - gnoochi stuffed with sweet potatoes and topped with goat cheese and cranberries. \n\nWhen warm weather gets here, stop by and check out the outdoor patio. It's a nice place for a summertime date.	1
Great place to have a relaxing lunch / dinner outside in the middle of the hot summer or cool fall - the food is good and the prices are reasonable.  I'm a big fan of the steak salad, although the fact that it has fries in it really does weird me out.  It is most likely just as fattening as a burger, but it sure does taste good and gets me craving it to come back!\n\nThey also have a great wine selection that is worth checking out.  In a pinch (or during snowpocolypse) they will also sell bottles to-go, but they do have to de-cork it for you before you leave, which is midly annoying, but better than nothing.	1
This was my first time at the Elbow Room at their new location on Walnut Street (previously located on Ellsworth Avenue.) My friend and I met for a low key Friday night dinner, but when we arrived at 6:30pm, to our surprise - it was PACKED!! It was really nice to see it so lively and bustling with a ton of people. It was a 30 minute wait for a table, and in that time we grabbed a drink at that bar. By the time we did that, our table was ready. After we ordered, our appetizer, salads, and entrees were all out within 15-20 minutes. The service was amazing, from our waitress, to even the owner coming out to make sure everything was ok. We ordered the fried zucchini for an appetizer, which was good but I thought the breading as a little bland, a great side salad, and I had the mediterranean pasta for my entree. Everything was better than I had expected it to be and I will definitely be returning for happy hour and dinner, hopefully very soon! 2 thumbs up!	1
Went to Elbow Room for a nice Sunday brunch experience. It was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly. My girlfriend ordered the album pancakes while I ordered the crab Eggs Benedict.  Her pancakes were absolutely inedible, with such a bizarre after taste that we had to say something to the waitress. The kitchen also forgot to put any hollandaise sauce on my eggs and it looked like a 10 year old had poached them. The asparagus was raw and there were a few bits of crab, so little I thought they had forgotten that too. By the time I got any hollandaise the eggs were cold and the whole plate was ruined. When we said something about the pancakes the waitress apologized profusely and brought out some fresh French Toast, but stated that the cooks also thought something was wrong with the pancakes - - - why did she let us order them, then?? Makes no sense.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and very attentive, but the cooking left a lot to be desired. We won't be going back there for brunch anytime soon. Worst Eggs Benedict experience I've ever had.	0
use to be a max and erma's and if that bar wasn't low enough it now misses the mark	0
I was promised a room full of elbows, and the Elbow Room seriously under-delivered.\n\nAdditionally, I was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection. When I asked our waiter what was on tap, he could not name a single choice. Its not a huge problem for me, but considering this place is somewhat of a pub, it would probably be wise to memorize a few choices. I had the Norman Rockwell Burger which was actually very good. The egg was perfectly fried and the burger was cooked precisely how I requested. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the crappy bun detracted from the burger as a whole, but overall I was happy. The fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course. My lady-friend's turkey-whatever sandwich was okay, nothing to get excited over.\n\nThe food itself deserves 3 stars, but the overall environment felt strange to me, hence 2 stars.	0
I have continued going back to Elbow Room hoping for a different experience. No matter how many times I order from them they always leave something off my burger. I do not understand how a burger with apple, cheese, and bacon always end up missing at least one of the 3 items. I am just happy it has the burger on it. \n\nSo tired of this place. I have talked to their chefs and managers about this issue and it has never been resolved. If you get takeout from this place I suggest always opening your box before you leave to make sure it is all there.	0
I have dined at the elbow room twice now. First time I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, and believe it or not, it was the worst grilled cheese I have had. I know what you are thinking......how can you mess up grilled cheese? I am still asking myself that question. I gave it another try last night because I did like the decor and the service was good. I thought maybe the cook was having a bad night. I had the Norman Rockwell burger and although it wasn't prepared as rare as I prefer, it was tasty. I was beginning to change my mind about this place until I decided to use the restroom.  Walking into this place, you would never imagine that the bathroom would be filthy. The decor is nice, the service is great, the food is average, and the bathroom is undescribable.	0
I had brunch here with two of my friends, one of whom had brought her daughter with her.\n\nThe bloody mary was COMPLETELY disgusting.  And there was no alcohol in it.  It was god awful.\n\nMy friends daughter had ordered lox & a bagel, and her bagel was ROCK HARD and cold.  We asked for a softer bagel, and they brought one out.  It was the same bagel, they just stuck it in the microwave.  \n\nMy friend ordered a salad and it was all iceberg lettuce, nothing to spectacular.\n\nI had a reuben and it was ok, but I was so grossed out by the bloody mary I couldn't eat it.  \n\nThe manager could not have been nicer, he comped the bloody mary and asked me how I make them for myself when I'm at home since he didn't think his recipe was that great.  \n\nI'm still so grossed out by that bloody mary i'm never going bac.	0
"\""Bland\"" is probably the key word in describing this place. A local Applebees-type feel.\n\nI was here for dinner one night, and the sandwich I got was unbelievably bland, so was the side of cole slaw. The artichoke dip was ok, but very greasy. The pasta a bit dry and bland as well.\n\nThe reverse happy hour concept from 9PM-11PM is cool. There is an OK number of beers on tap. The service is friendly and efficient.\n\nHowever, the food is sub-par, so I won't be returning even if I were in the area."	0
"I fully agree with reviewers who call the food bland, and overall, I think there are much better dining options for the money in the vicinity.  I have tried a number of items on the menu here and found them to be all underwhelming, despite the fact that their average entree costs nearly $20.\n\nFor example, the hanger steak has come out under-seasoned and chewy, the braised short ribs tasting no better than ones you can easily make at home -- again despite being roughly $20 or more each.  The starters that I have had were also very uninspiring, such as the hummus which is, at best, on par with store-bought hummus.  For a restaurant at this price point, it is simply not worth the money.\n\nFor \""cheap\"" eats in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh, I prefer options like BRGR or Dinette.  At either of those locations, entrees are less expensive while much more consistent and flavorful."	0
Drinks are good but food sucks. I tried the food multiple times and I think only the french onion soup and salads are descent. The main courses are very low quality.	0
Wonderful brunch. The food and service was great. The waiters were very friendly and the food wasn't too pricey. Really a great option for brunch.	1
"As we strolled up Walnut Street this morning we were greeted by a large sandwich board sign advertising brunch.  Spirits lifted we raced inside for the sidewalk advertised  breakfast glories...sat down...and were told brunch was only on Sundays. My lil heart fell. \nRegroup. I ordered the half sandwich and chili and my partner in this mess ordered a chop salad.  \nThe chili should be renamed Alpo & Cheddar. The salads are better at Get Go.\nAnd direct quote upon our server checking on us..drumroll....\""From what I see I presume you are okay\"" and a quick exit stage left.\nWe shall not be returning. Even as tempting as the $10 sangria made of pure canned fruit juice appears."	0
"It's a nice enough place with a decent selection of drinks (and a not-bad post-9pm happy hour), but I'd steer clear of the food.  If the portions were large and delicious, the prices would be more than reasonable, but sadly that's not the case.  I've never really enjoyed anything I've eaten here, and the downright terrible burger is what prompted me to write the review warning folks away (\""medium rare\"" came out \""well done\"" and no one noticed or even asked how it was).\n\nSo come here if you want to grab a drink with your friends on Walnut Street.  But I, for one, will be going someplace else first if I want dinner too."	0
A couple things about happy hour- late happy hour is awesome, martini happy hour is awesome, but the happy hour menu is super limited. For such a delicious dirty martini, though, full price was ok- occasionally. Maybe they keep it off the half off menu so I don't move in. We only had dessert, so I can't comment on rest of the menu- but it all seems relatively well priced. The carrot cake was bomb, but to be fair, it's hard to mess up anything with cream cheese icing. I'll definitely be coming back to get a more rounded experience. But so far it's the bee's knees!	1
My wife and daughter and I walked in and were seated immediately by the hostess.  We sat down and browsed the menu and made our selections.  Ten or so minutes passed by as various wait staff passed by our table. At about the fifteen minute mark, without even as much as water service, we got up and left.  The hostess, as well as  the wait staff that we passed by on or way out the door made no attempt  to engage us in any way.  There wasn't much of a crowd there and I don't expect, with this type of service, business to be picking up any time soon.	0
"Place was interesting. The decor reminds you of \""cheers\"" because of the wood. I had a salmon wrap and it was very good. It had a mustard sauce and came with fries. Prices were decent. Our waitress lacked personality and her breath smelled bad, but she got everything.food wise right. It took awhile to bring our drinks. I split the check with my friend, and she didn't divide the items correctly.I probably wouldn't come here again because it wasn't \""special\"". If I'm coming all the way from Monroeville, then I want more bang for my buck."	0
The drinks were fantastic... When we could get a waiters attention.  However, the bar closed at 12:00 on a Saturday night.  Furthermore the waiter took almost 20 minutes to sort out our tabs.  I usually love the elbow room, however on this particular night it was impossible to get a drink or pay our tab .  I'm not sure we will be back.	0
Bad,  very bad.    Ordered Gin and Tonic.....tonic water was as flat as water.   Returned drinks and ordered wine.   Wine was ok but overpriced.    Ordered an omelet which was basically an egg pancake with the omelet stuff dumped on top.     Home fries were undercooked.   Biscuit had overpowering flavor of artificial butter.   \nThe chicken on the salad was entrenched with artificial flavor.    I think this restaurant does not use 'fresh' ingredients and buys a lot of things already prepared and all they have to do is 'heat things up'.    So their lazy way of doing things certainly has lost us as a customer.   Also....the waitress was wearing cologne or perfume...lots of it...her scent lingered on and on.   NO Server should be wearing a scent at work.   I would equate their food with a fast food restaurant.   Not a compliment.	0
This place is definitely great. Any entree I have had has been excellent.. The service is great too. Bartender is very friendly and the atmosphere is very nice ! I'm going to be a regular for sure!	1
I have been to the elbow room a few times.  The food and the service meet good standards.  Do not expect a gourmet, extraordinary menu but it is serves normal American bar/restaurant food.  The Sunday brunch menu is also nice (the Greek omelet is highly recommended if you are into omelets).  The biggest advantage of the place is its location and the atmosphere.  The new venue on walnut has a nice feel; something between a classy, upscale restaurant but at the same time casual, family-oriented.  I always enjoy having a grub here and I will definitely go back many times.	1
"Walking by on a Saturday morning, I was pleased to see that they offered a weekend brunch, and an alternative to the overcrowded and overrated Pamela's next door.  I ordered an omelette for $9 and a fruit plate for $7 and my wife ordered a grilled chicken salad.  My wife's salad was good.  My omelette, however, was inedible -- a round, rock-hard disk smothered in cheese.  In a addition, we ordered a fruit plate for $7 which was a complete embarassment of several tiny pieces of fruit strewn about a plate with a tiny souffle cup of yogurt.  I hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad. I told the server as nicely as possible that it wasn't her fault and I didn't want to appear difficult but I just could not eat the omelette and the fruit plate was really unappealing and overpriced.  She gave me an icy cold look that communicated \""You are a crazy, difficult, demanding jerk,\"" but took the food back and took it off my check.  Upon reading some of the reviews here, it seems like I am not alone."	0
Always enjoy coming to The Elbow Room. Atmosphere is great. Food is great. Jason was our server. He did an excellent job! Highly recommend asking for Jason.	1
So... I would have posted pictures, but devoured everything before I could remember, lol. \n\nThe food is AMAZING! The service is great also. Salmon burger, french fries, apple crisps, regular burgers, and the list goes on! I haven't even told you the best part... THEY DELIVER!!!!! Unfortunately, this will be an overweight summer... but a happy one!	1
"This place is hit or miss. It'll depends on who is in the kitchen, I think, and whether or not management feels like taking the job seriously.  I've had good meals here, and I've had really bad ones. I've had enough bad ones that I try not to go here unless there's no other choice.  I got a piece of fish once that you could drive a nail with. The Rubens are always stringy and it's impossible to take a bite out of the sandwich without dragging all the meat out in one big glob. And I don't think I've seen the same waitstaff here more than once. Big turnover. There's no pride in the service or the food at all.  This place is never been truly \""good\"", things just seem to keep getting worse."	0
I used this place for a while, but now having moved to Shadyside, I can't see myself making the trip down to Forbes. Anyway, the biggest plus for this place (and why I went there in the first place) is that they have same-day service. In by 11am, done by 5pm. Fantastic! That alone makes it worthwhile.\n\nOn the other hand, they wrote my last name in black permanent marker on the bottom of the button seam (no clue what that's called) every single one of my dress shirts. Why?? This wouldn't be such a huge problem, but they did it on my white shirts that I don't wear tucked in! And the black bleeds through to the front. Not cool at all.\n\nSo, go here if you need a quick turn around, but ask them not to mark up all your clothing!	1
Took my boyfriends suit to get dry cleaned, when I picked it up I had to wait a really long time which was petty absurd because I was the only one there and they had 3 employees behind the counter but only 1 doing work. The price was reasonable but when my bf put his suit on, he noticed they had written his name in sharpie inside all the pieces - even the back of the tie. Even though the markings weren't visible, it was sill irritating. \n\nWe found a really awesome dry cleaner (Runners) which was always reasonable, the owner (or manager) was always friendly and remembered your face and name. We did a lot of business here but sadly the Greenfield location closed. \n\nFooters has so many locations in Pittsburgh in convenient locations but it is definitely worth seeking out some other place.	0
Such a pleasurable experience! Everyone one from Jason at the front desk, to Katherine the stylist's assistant, to Richard the stylist were sweet, attentive, and professional! I came in there with a curly mess of long hair that hadn't been attended to in 9 months, and I left with hair worthy of an Herbal Essence commercial. I couldn't have asked for better service, a better style, or a better stylist!	1
I've since had two more haircuts from Richard. The second haircut was great, but styled horribly. When I left I literally looked like I was wearing a wig from the early '90's. Once I was able to fix it myself and style it totally differently than he intended, I really loved it. The third haircut was just awful: styled awful, looked strange. I just hate it, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm now on the look out for a new haircutting home!	0
I went into Dean of Shadyside salon to get my hair colored. My stylist was nice and friendly however that was not the problem that I encountered at this salon. My stylist rushed through the process of coloring my hair as she had another client during the same time as my appointment. In addition, my hair was just left to hang (not pulled/clipped back) while my hair was being colored making the dark hair dye smear over my ears, neck and face. The worst part was checking out. The charge for the hair color was a decent/normal price around $50.00. However this salon charges you extra if you need more color (if you have thick hair). Are you kidding me? On top on that, they also don't include the blow dry, which yes is more money. Not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service. Won't be back .	0
"My roommate and I refer to Courtney as \""Courtney Copperfield\"" because she is a legit magician! I gave her a picture of the haircut I wanted and it actually looked better than the picture when she was done. She also knew exactly what colors to put together to achieve the shade I wanted for Fall. Sadly, I moved out of Pittsburgh and I know it will be a struggle to find somewhere as fabulous as Dean."	1
If you are into crooked haircuts and terrible customer service, this is your salon.	0
Terrible! I purchased a groupon, but after all of the additional fees (upgrade to a higher level stylist because no one included in the groupon was available for a month, etc) I paid full price without full price service. If you make the mistake of going here, bring cash to tip your stylist. The receptionist cannot handle tips at all. They do offer a shady ATM that you can use and pay the surcharge, then put the tip in an envelope in a comment box. Haircut was ok, but certainly not near what I expected after reading the other reviews. I left extremely upset and no one cared. Terrible customer service!	0
Love my hair!  I bought a Groupon for a cut and hairline highlights because I was looking for a place that would give me a good haircut.   My hair is naturally curly so I've had more than my share of bad cuts... them they try to style it and it gets worse. Not Dean of Shadyside!  Ally took the time to discuss my the color of my highlights and make sure that I was comfortable with everything before she started (I have only had highlights done once before and they were bad).  The end product was great!   She listened to what I wanted and did it!   This is the first time in a very long time that I didn't leave a salon and pull my hair back.   My next appointment is already scheduled.	1
I an very happy with my haircut :) Staff are very polite too.	1
Given the big salon, I think your experience will be highly related to which stylist you chose. I bought a Groupon for a level 3 haircut and moisture treatment. The stylist Ken spent 5 mins for the cutting, 40 mins to blow the hair dry and chatting and forgot the moisture treatment. The technique of the haircut is so poor. There is no layer of the cutting and it is not horizontally on the same level. I think he is not serious about what he did. I will not come for the second time. MCN is much better in this sense. You should definitely try to avoid him as your stylist if you choose to go to Dean of Shadyside.	0
Pros: convenient location in Shadyside, sufficient lighting for the mood\n\nCons: Crowded, full of frat-boy types, bartenders would kick everyone out at closing time\n\nPerhaps, I didn't have a great experience because I got dragged here against my will.\n\nBut it was unbearably crowded and loud.  The kind where it's most likely that you'll spill someone's else's drink.  It was more than once that I heard glass breaking.  It's a kind of place you would go to meet random people than a place you would go to just hang out with friends. \n\nMy friends enjoyed their drinks, so I grant the bar that.  At closing time however, the bartender yelled that we had to get out since it was closing.  They turned on the bright lights, cut the music and stopped the heat to force us out.\n\nSo I might not be the target audience.  This is my friend's favorite bar.  I am not sure why.  The frat-boy like atmosphere may be it, but I have always preferred the low-key type bars.	0
Good Food, Good Beers, Better Prices.\n\nTry the Patio outback, you'll love it.	1
"First of all the website, as I was told, \""has been down for 4 years\"" - even though it is very up. The specials and menu prices are apparently wrong.\n\nMy friends and I chose this place solely based on the fact they had advertised $3.50 20 oz Guinness. We needed a place to celebrate our graduation. With a party of 4 that grew to 6 we found the place pretty crowded and loud after awhile. Mostly we were pissed off that we were told on our 3rd round that the Guinness we were drinking was actually $5.50.\n...really, it wasn't even a full 20 oz glass, it was one of those damn plastic cups. When we ordered at the beginning of the night it was quiet and the bartender said nothing about the price. At that point we decided to go somewhere else because it really wasn't our kind of bar in the first place, and you can absolutely find much cheaper Guinness in this city. \n\nThe guy didn't even apologize for the website - it's called false advertising, and it's a dick move, Mr. William Penn."	0
"Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.  \nPreacher Haggard/Twinkie Ted\nWilliam Pen Tavern before 10 p.m. /after 10 p.m.\n\nYes, there are two William Penn Taverns.  Two personalities.  \n\nOne that is a local bar with a cast of characters hanging out, reading the paper, making jokes, all on a first name basis.  Good bar food.  \n\nThe other is hormone fueled meat market kind of place for the under 25 crowd.  \n\nAnyway, both are fine institutions, depending on your flavor.  But make sure you pick the right one.  \n\nI'm personally in bed by 10.  I do like the \""south jersey cheese steak\"" an awful lot."	1
Great food and normally great atmosphere, but today thus music was the nastiest hardcore rap that was just offensive. How many F-bombs can you realistically listen to while eating lunch and watching sports. Dropped 2 stars from what I would last night whenit used to be my favorite place in shadyside.	0
Weirdest nights ever.\nWormhole tequila black-out.\nToo crowded/hot/cold.\n\n(b)	0
The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life.	0
Probably the worst bar in Shadyside to go on Friday/Saturday nights. Waaay too crowded and loud. The clientele sucks - it's people in their mid to late-20's desperately trying to cling onto their college years by being loud and obnoxious. \n\nIt does have a nice back patio that is heated during the winter and smoking is permitted, which is nice. If you are there on a week night, it might not be so bad.\n\nDrink prices aren't anything special and cocktails aren't that strong.\n\nI'd venture a guess that this is a good hang-out spot during sporting events. It feels very sports-bar oriented.\n\nI would say this is a good bar to go with a large drunk group, and that's it. If you are by yourself or in a small group, Cappy's or Mardi Gras would be much better IMO.	0
It's a sports bar... I've heard the wings were good, but the bad hip-hop was too loud to be worth staying for more than one glass	0

What a great neighbourhood joint!  I can't speak to the food as we stopped there after dinner - but parked ourselves at the bar to watch a baseball game and have a few drinks. We were visiting Pittsburgh from California, and popped in on our way back to the hotel. Owner Brian Carey mans the bar and keeps the casual atmosphere going with lighthearted banter. Stick around long enough and you will meet staff and owners from other local waterholes, or maybe even your local councilman. It's a great little place w/irish pub ambiance. Make sure to pop your head in for a drink or two on a Thursday night - you never know who might show up - like the Bud guy or the Jagermeister girls - it's a busy place, and a lot of fun, w/great staff and an owner who cares - this is as close to CHEERS as you'll ever get	1
This is a neighborhood Denny's with a bar. Small place and the meal was served on plastic plates and they used plastic mugs for coffee. At best, less than mediocre breakfast. Pamela's was closed and we were really hungry. Service was slow but they were nice about it. I don't plan to return and would choose an alternative.	0
Best bar on Walnut.\nGo here anytime of day,\nThey will have your fix.\n\n(b)	1
Can't comment on food since I was just in for beers.  \n\nOkay crowd, friendly bartender, okay beer selection, but it's pretty tacky, and not really in a good way.  Looks like the last time any money was put into the place was maybe 1979.	0
Crappy's is more like it... sorry I could NOT resist!\n\nThis place is very below average.  The bar is small, good luck getting a seat, it's normally filled with regulars, who I have a sneaking suspicion drink for a reduced rate ;)   Also, the food is blah; they advertise that it is healthier because it is all baked. Um, this results in super fattening foods baked.. this does not mean it is healthy by any means, who do they think they are kidding?? LOL\n\nAnyways, as other reviewers have mentioned the decor is 1975 and wicker all over.  \n\nWith so many options in Shadyside, I don't see any reason to go here.	0
I could be considered a Cappy's regular.\n\nI love this bar and I'm a little bit obsessed with their Sonoma Turkey wrap--try it, it's very good! \n\nWednesday is Trivia Night at Cappy's at it gets PACKED.  You must be in the bar by 7:30 to get a table, and even then it's iffy bc what the other regulars have started showing up that early and eating dinner before trivia. \n\nIt's not the cheapest place to drink at; it looks like a dive but it's not priced like one.  the food is good, the bartender is great, and it attracts a crowd of nice people!	1
I was surprised how good the food was. Great service very friendly people.	1
"How does this place survive in the middle of Walnut Street?  I understand how people like to wait in line for hours for breakfast on a Sunday but I WOULD NOT do it for a place like this.  Given, our first mistake was going for breakfast at a place labeled a \""dive bar\"" on yelp---but still.  Perhaps the wait wasn't meant to be an hour but our waitress definitely FORGOT OUR ORDER and we sat there wondering what could be so tricky about some eggs and toast.  \n\n...one hour and one complaint later...\n\nThe food arrives.  Hot sauce was more difficult, took two requests before it came.  Of course I arrived last and ordered 30 min after everyone else but my food came first.  The food is basic and inexpensive, you get what you pay for.  In summary my Shadyside friends, unless it's a beautiful day and you just want to sit outside (their only plus is they have a few outside tables), keep on going down Walnut for some better options."	0
Avg food, too salty.	0
Cappy's is a rarity on Walnut Street: it's as close to unpretentious as you'll ever get in this affluent and often snooty shopping district.  As others have noted, it's a dive bar that happens to serve pretty decent food; my wife thinks that the Big Mountain sandwich is to die for (and I'd agree).  The service has always been friendly, and it never seems to get as loud in here as it gets in some other places (Shady Grove, I'm looking at you).\n\nI know it might sound strange, but one of the things that I appreciate the most about Cappy's is that it treats its waitresses as waitresses, not as sex symbols.  I've always found the skimpy outfits that waitresses choose to wear (or are made to wear) at some other places to be rather insulting -- these women are there to do their job, not to be ogled at by everyone in the area.  So thumbs up, Cappy's, for treating your female employees with some respect!\n\nMy wife and I moved away from the Shadyside area a few months ago.  Cappy's is the one thing we miss.  Big Mountain forever!	1
I came\nHere for breakfast so When you first walk in I asked myself am I in the right place, I was .... Starters food is nothing outta the ordinary,,one funny thing that stood out was when we asked our server if they served any other meats aside from pork based meats she responded BACON! And no not turkey bacon... So clearly lil off there...  Other then that we order common breakfast .. Which was ok... I had the western omelette with turkey sausage ... The peppers and the onions were not sliced small enough and were overpoweringly huge ... Lil less On that lil more on the egg,,.. Which I wonder if the eggs were made from liquid base out of a carton ... Yeah so place was ok if u wanna eat in desperation ...	0
In my opinion, the is a prime example of a bad Shadyside bar. It's right on Walnut, too small, always too crowded, and I feel like I'm a 21-yr old college student when I go out there. It's miserable to be there on the weekend when it's so crowded because it's such a small space. The only reason I'm giving this bar 2 instead of 1 star is because the karaoke on Fridays (if you can handle the people and the crowd) is pretty good- although there are half a dozen better places to karaoke in Pittsburgh. Furthermore, I have sat on the patio table for a nice chill happy hour once watching the craziness of Walnut Street happen in front of me- which was oddly relaxing.	0
Horrible service. Waited 50 minutes and had no food and had to ask continuously for more coffee. Don't come here	0
I'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible.  This is the worst spot on Walnut St!  I'm not even sure where to start. The bar is small and overpriced. I had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved.  The vegetables weren't even cooked. This is a place no one wants to--or should ever want to go.	0
Yum! I just picked up a cookie platter ($32...see photo) for a party and it looks awesome. Can't wait to have my guests drool over the buttery goodness that are Prantls' cookies. \n\nOther than the treats, this place makes some really decent bread. I've tried it a few times now, and have yet to be disappointed. If you live in Shadyside, make sure to check this place out.\n\n...oh and they sell Enrico's biscottis. Can't go wrong with those!	1
"Come here for the jelly sandwich cookies. BEST jelly sandwich cookies ever. they're round, 2 layers, powdered sugar, and you can see the jam in a little cut out circle on the top layer. Their \""burnt almond torte cake\"" is supposed to be really famous, but i always got distracted by the cookies..."	1
Oh. My. God. So. Good.	1
I'm not really a dessert person, but I was going home to visit and I always like to bring a little bit of Pittsburgh home with me so I stopped in for some goodies. I got an assortment of their mini pastries which was perfect because you get to sample a little bit of everything. Everyone was impressed. In fact, so impressed that I'm not allowed home without a Prantl's box in my hand.\n\nThe burnt almond torte with vanilla icing is simply to die for. I've had it several times and it's always been moist and an explosion of nutty goodness with every bite. Let me stop myself... this is starting to sound dirty.\n\nIn addition to wonderful pastries, they also offer a decent selection of breads and rolls which are tasty as well, but I wouldn't go out of my for them.	1
"Yumster in my Tumster!  I first got introduced to Prantl's a few years ago when I lived in Shadyside.  I tried their decorative cookies and I was hooked.  Since then I've tried many of their delectable pastries and some noteworthy ones include the decorative cookies, almond torte, and pecan tassies - I'm sure everything else is also wonderful!\n\nI'm so happy they recently opened up their downtown location, now I don't have to worry about hours of operation b/c I work so close to them downtown, but I still think fondly of the Shadyside location.  \n\nI definitely recommend this place for a quick sugary snack or if you need to buy pastries for a group of people.  It is more expensive than some other bakeries, but I think this is the type of place where \""you get what you pay for\"" is applicable."	1
White chocolate raspberry cup, chocolate peanut butter bar, burnt almond torte, oh my!	1
This is always a treat... the beloved burnt almond torte lives up to the hype and is never a disappointment.  Seasonal items like pumpkin gob is enjoyable as well.  Prices are affordable, though you may need to go elsewhere for the perfect coffee to pair with your dessert :D.	1
If you have not tried their Burnt Almond Torte you must comehere! These are like crack, get one for someone's birthday if they love almonds, they'll love you for sure! They are frozen so make sure you take it out of the fridge a little bit ahead of time before serving, it'll be a huge hit for any parties or holidays!	1
Wow! Their burnt almond torte is a Pittsburgh staple, and the few other things that I've tried from them have been equally delicious! I highly recommend checking out this bakery.	1
They have the best Burnt Almond Torte, so Good!   And if you like lady locks their the best I've had also.  Another of my favorites are the little cake cups they make .  There are a variety, like Burnt Almond Torte, Cookies and Cream, Pumpkin cheesecake, Vanilla Raspberry, German Chocolate, and so on.  Its the perfect miniature dessert!\n\nFor my daughters wedding I ordered five dozen of these for the cookie table. They were a nice addition to the cookies and display beautifully.  They were a Big Hit!	1
Meh is right. My whole family is in love with Prantl's enough so that they convinced me to get my birthday cupcakes from there... First of all. They don't have cupcakes they have these little mini cakes that cost an arm and a leg, and are mostly fluffed up icing...bleh.\n\nThen, they aren't even that nice! My mom ordered the cakes, and I didn't know what name they were under... I understand that you have a line, but there is no reason to tell me i am wasting your time, when I am obviously buying something. MAYBE they could have know which order was mine by my telling them what was in it, but nope they needed the name. So I had to guess through a few before I got it BFD! \n\nRude, crowded, and most importantly not that great!	0
Prantl's is my favorite bakery.  I've lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and I've always gotten my birthday cake here (well over 2 decades worth of cakes!).  Prantl's always has a place in my heart.  After the change in ownership, the bakery has seemed to gone downhill a bit.  The most obvious was the increase in prices.  Still a great place for baked goods! Try the Burnt Almond Torte if you haven't yet!	1
I don't even like cake, but, the best dessert I have ever had is the Burnt Almond Torte from Prantl's! It is so delicious, nothing compares!	1
Nothing stood out, including the famous burnt almond torte.	0
Nope. Sorry, I grew up in pgh. Heart of a true pittsburgher. But my gosh. One word for prantl's: crisco. Seriously, my arteries hurt after eating a desert from this place. Not half as good as a few of the French etc bakeries around. Why waste your cardiovascular health on this place--go get gelato next door and you'll be better off!	0
I had such a discouraging experience today at Prantl's.  A girl offered to wait on me, but then walked away without filling my order.   I waited several minutes, and then spoke up to get waited on.  It really wasn't worth the wait.  Pay attention to the other reviews on here about rude staff.  I will not be returning.	0
Almond torte cake is way too overhyped.  I ordered one after seeing an article on Huffington Post so with a description like that who wouldn't want to try it!?  It's a diabetics worst nightmare, sugar overload. The filling in the middle had a bland taste, nothing special about it. Maybe it's because I ordered the cake and had it shipped to MD that it tasted bad.  People raving about this cake should try middle eastern or Greek bakeries! I gave a two because they have great customer service when emailing back.	0
If you want to get pastries while being yelled at by the staff and treated like dirt, this is the place for you.	0
Prantl's very disappoints me. My favorite is the mini version of their famous burnt almond cake. They somehow compact all the flavor of their sheet cake into one little cupcake and do not skimp on the burnt almonds as well as the icing. Some of the cupcakes are too sweet for me but they please my friend so it is just a matter of preference for sweetness.	1
Very good doughnuts! Only purchased the glazed but if you heat it up it's oh so good. Also, the cinnamon roll was delightful. Not a fan of their cookies, but hey everything else is very good. If you have a sweet craving, this is definitely a top spot to come pig out at.	1
Like many others,  I saw the Huffpost article calling Prantl's burnt almond torte the best cake in America.   Being a pastry chef myself,  I had to try it.   I was not impressed.   The cake itself is light, fluffy,  and pleasant enough (which is the only reason I didn't go for one star),  but the filling was,  well,  if I didn't know it had filling I wouldn't have been able to detect any from the taste.   The frosting was average bakery fare (which,  to me,  is a below average taste).   I did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping.   I ate one slice,  and gave the rest away.   Might be fine to serve with coffee,  etc if you are a local,  but definitely not worth the price and shipping.  I doubt this is even the best cake in Pittsburgh,  much less the entire USA.   I wonder which Prantl's family member has a friend at Huffpost?	0
While I still like the almond torte, I just can't justify my original rating when the overall selections are just subpar. After trying a larger selection of their baked goods, especially the mini cake cups, I realized they all look delicious but when you bite into them, they're really dry and full of generic cake frosting. \nIf you're still tempted to get one,  go with the tiramisu since it has the redeeming factor of having a strong coffee flavor.	0
I really wanted to like this bakery! I came in with high expectations, I'll admit, because I thought I had heard good things about it. I bought about four different pastries to sample with a friend so we could eat them with our coffee across the street. Though the presentation of the treats were lovely, every single one I picked out was sickeningly sweet and tasted the same as the next. Far too much frosting on each pastry and we only could finish one small pastry between the two of us. Overall, unimpressed. However, it probably doesn't help that I had just come back from Austria which arguably has the best pastries in the world!	0
So glad I popped in here! I love local bakeries and this one is tremendous! The almond torte is too die for! Also sampled the cookies and cream, red velvet and peanut butter. Ranked:\n1. Almond torte\n2. Red velvet\n3. Cookies and cream\n4. Peanut butter (wasn't anything super special, but the flavors above were superb!)\nI binge are three & didn't feel guilty.	1
Best doughnuts in Pittsburgh. \n\nI generally pass on other baked goods. Mediocre bread.\n\nGenerally unfriendly staff, but Walnut St. attracts pretty arrogant customers - so it makes sense.	1
Horrible service. I have never been treated so poorly in a cafe. The coffee wasn't spectacular, and it was fairly expensive for what it was. Head down to Starbucks or the Coffee Beanery.	0
I see people sitting in Jitters' chairs outside all the time and I like the decor so I really, really want to like this place but the first time was the last time. The service was horrible and their coffee didn't taste great. I waited for ten minutes at least before the two people manning the cashier/bar before I was paid attention to and serviced as they were busy chatting with one of their friends who had stopped in. After getting my coffee, they were low on the sugars and milks and other fix-ins so was not pleased even further, especially for what I paid for a small coffee.	0
Big fan!  First time i have ever been to this place, and the milkshake I got was delicious.  My mother also got a frozen coffee, and I think I wound up drinking all of it for her.\n\nThe cookies that were there also were great.  I am not sure whether they cooked them there fresh or not, but they were delicious.  \n\nDefiantly the best stop my mother and I had while we were on Walnut street, and i would venture back to the place in a second.\n\nPS the wait staff was also very pleasant and kind.	1
Best coffee on Walnut. Ice cream is excellent. Like the other commentators, I feel the service can be hit or miss, mostly because the lack of a clear location to form a line, but it is generally excellent. The venue isn't as cool as Coffee Tree, but the staff are always friendly, and again, the coffee is better. This is my go-to coffee place in Shadyside.	1
Awesome staff, quick and accurate service, great tasting coffee and free wifi... Umm, what else do you need?  I avoid the other coffee spots on Walnut either because the staff ain't so hot or it's always jam-packed.  Jitters is cozy and clean, check it out if you need a quiet little place to work or study.  The baked stuff always smells delicious, but I have yet to indulge...	1
I generally hate flavored coffees, but I always enjoy the flavored coffees here, especially the Hazelnut and Coconut when they are featured.\n\nThe remodel makes the place much more inviting than it was in the past, and I love going in the mornings and seeing all the regulars. \n\nIt's definitely comparable to Coffee Tree Roasters a few storefronts down, and definitely better than Starbucks. Fun spot for studying I would imagine, but those days are behind me thank goodness.	1
This place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners. It used to be simple to buy coffee. They used to have a white mocha but not anymore. I miss the old owner of the place. \nBut still support small caf\u00e9s!!!	0
"Pamela is a bad representation of this location! Attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this \""employee.\"" I will not return."	0
I love love love this store. It's a mecca of kooky gifts, books, cards, calendars, tshirts, jewelry, candles... pretty much everything you could ask for. I've spent over an hour just browsing, and around the holidays or birthdays, it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get. You can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of Harry Potter hardback books. And don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches. You'll be hard pressed to NOT buy anything before you leave.	1
Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed. Even better, there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself. It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles.	1
Such a great store. They stock everything (EVERYTHING), including: cards, hand puppets, necklaces, books, etc... Kards Unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale. Definitely my favorite store on Walnut.	1
If you are looking for an outstanding comedy gift, this is the place for you.\n\nAlso: a strategically hip book selection, high quality puppets, a wall of giggle-worthy novelty shirts and a jewelry case.  Oh, and KARDS.\n\nFound along the wall: bacon band-aids, insta-Irish accent mouth spray, famous philosopher finger puppets, librarian action figure, vulgar piggie banks, zombie plastic animals, etc.  A tiny sampling of the silliness.	1
"They have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back, but I've usually come here to browse the books (lots of Kurt Vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like \""While you were out\"" but with snarky commentary). Not only do you have a ton of options here, but they're very well curated options. One of the very best gift shops around!"	1
"A door sign reads \""hiring enthusiastic, energetic and humorous employees\"" , so I walk-in. Immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she \""kinda likes it\"". I couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds I walked through the door.\n\n Super savvy, humorous and fun: This is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up! I left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son, silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk, witty comic novels, and an irresistible coin pouch. It's more than shopping in here, it's a whole experience. Go in, get lots for awhile..."	1
kards unlimited is similar to pulp in dc in that it features offbeat gifts and unique cards, but adds jewelry and literature to the mix.\n\nwhile i've found gems here in terms of cards, i really had to *search* for them, unlike other stores where i find so many awesome cards i don't know which to pick..and end up leaving with seven birthday cards, spending more money than anticipated, and no money for food*. the back area has more mainstream cards by hallmark and shoebox (read:: cheaper), as well as posters, gift bags, and ribbons.\n\nthe gift selection are great and span from make-your-own-porno kits (do you like to do it yourself?) to cookie cutters, noveltees**, journals, children's toys, and items only locals would understand and find amusing.\n\ni appreciate the space dedicated to graphic novels, the corridor of books, n'at***, but this place is brimming with so much product, it's damn near impossible to navigate through the twists and turns, even when you know exactly what you're looking for and where it is.\n\nstill, stopping by is a must when on walnut.\n\n---\n*priorities, people. at least all my friends will have epic birthday cards!\n**seewhatididthere.\n***i'm basically a local now.	1
What more can I say about Kards Unlimited that hasn't already been stated?  The reviews are glowing and well-deserved!  More than just stationary and cards, Kards Unlimited is locally-owned in Shadyside and has a quirky selection of everything from books, jewelry, toys, posters, games, bath/body, and novelty gifts.  I have found many a birthday and Christmas presents here, as well as plenty of knick-knacks for myself.  Since I moved from Pittsburgh, I haven't been back, but I am going to make a point to visit next time I'm in town!	1
Large selection of unique/cute-tastic gifts.  Humerous knick-knacks/books galore.  Very adorable and staff was very pleasant.  Looking forward to going back again.	1
I met a friend for high tea on a weekday so we were the only ones there which we didn't mind at all given that we both brought our two year old children. We were served by Chef Jackie who I found to be friendly and informative. I was very impressed with the large selection of tea that included both loose and bagged options. We were told we could try as many as we wanted. \n\nI must admit I was a little disappointed with the quantity of sandwiches given. We were served an egg salad sandwich, a ham with avocado, and a take on a BLT which was bacon, tomato, and julienned spinach on top served on a piece of French bread. I wanted more. The second plate had fresh fruit and two scones- citrus and vanilla cream. Both were delicious but small in size. The final plate had a brownie, sponge cake, and small cupcake. Everything was delicious but I would have rather have had another sandwich or two over the last plate and larger scones. All of this cost $21pp.	1
Amazing!\n\nI recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. \n\nA++++!!!	1
I've never had the pleasure of staying here but this is where my boyfriends mom stays when she is in town. They've been very nice to accommodate my boyfriend and I even though we are not staying so I've had a few breakfasts here. They food is always delicious- usually a sweet or savory option plus a classic eggs, toast, meat, bread. The French toast is delicious. The bacon is so yummy crispy delicious. Coffee here is really good! \n\nThey have a beautiful back patio and a station with coffee and tea out all the time. So I've spent a few afternoons enjoying that. All the staff has been very gracious to us.	1
Went for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time!  The inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunch!\n\nService is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant!  The brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit, breads, entree, dessert!  And you also have you choice of juices, coffee and/or tea!\n\nAll the things we tried were delicious!  There were so many things, I can barely remember.  \n\n\nThey also serve Afternoon Tea, which I'm sure is fabulous!!! So, that's definitely next on my list!	1
First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING	1
Didn't havana go out of biz? I think this is the place with the purple awning. If not, oops! This place is OK. It does have a swanky feel and the martini's are OK but overall it is nothing special. Usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on Ellsworth.	0
"Tokyo Japanese Food Store is the only Japanese grocery in the area with a nice selection of produce, fish and processed foods.  Not all, but many things are overpriced, and I would check out Lotus (Asian market) in the strip district for certain items such as sauces, noodles, etc.\n\nThey are known to sell things past expiration dates: sometimes in the form as a \""sale\"" without explicitly notifying the customer of the condition.  Now, I don't have a problem with buying slightly expired non-perishable (boxed, canned) foods for less... but I expect an honest business.\n\nMany of their raw fish look discolored and old, making me ponder the honesty of the packaging dates...\n\nIn the end, many of the Japanese items can only be attained here, in Pittsburgh - having a small, but formidable selection to suit your needs.   I would just be weary with expiration dates and the perishables they sell."	0
This is a pricey Japanese grocery store with a wide variety of goods.  I know it better as our Saturday go-to place for BENTO BOXES.  Oh yes, they are so good.  They are made fresh daily by the nice Japanese mom and pop that own the place.  They make sushi as well and it is expensive but it really does taste a million times better than the Giant Eagle stuff.  They also sell SASHIMI grade fish so we tried our hand at sashimi cutting one afternoon as well.	1
The bento lunches made by the owners at Tokyo Japanese Food Store are the bomb!! They satisfy any Japanese food craving that I might have. They typically either have something fried or grilled along with a small salad, rice and some other tiny sides, which can be found in the fridge in the back of the store.\n\nIf you want to make any type of Japanese food this store would have anything that you would need though a little pricey. However their fresh fish is out of the world if you want to make your own sushi or sashimi. I also bought the largest carrot that I have ever seen (for under a buck!) to go with a cold soba noodle dish that I was making. \n\nYou won't regret popping in here as the owners take pride in their shop and keep it clean and all food fresh though note there is a $10 minimum for credit card.	1
I was looking for something Japanese around me but had no luck until I came across this place, the prices are fair. I don't understand why people are complaining about the price, it's coming from japan! Of course it will be more than the American junk candy. The food is very fresh and extremely good for the price, I bought a big list of stuff and I would buy out the entire store if I had the money. They are very kind and nice, polite and funny. They are willing to help you out and they give you a nice verity of food and items for a little shop they are. I would highly suggest going there, the food is healthier for you and isn't much more than our typical everyday food. They have certainly got me wanting to go back for more.	1
I like coming here with a group of people. I think this place may be able to claim they have the cheapest prices in Shadyside. Although many have said that this is pretty much a 'meathead' joint/sausage fest, I think the same could be said of other shadyside bars (william penn, doc's, etc.) \n\nI give the saloon four stars because it's near my house, has cheap drinks, and plenty of space. Usually dead on the weekdays.	1
This bar smells like a smoky urinal cake, all the time.\n\nI only go in to buy six packs.  The bar staff seems nice enough.  It def seems like a frat crowd.\n\nThey get 2 stars only bc there is a skee ball machine.	0
I am in the service industry and my friends and I came here for my birthday. It was the worst experience and the bartender wouldn't give us lemons or limes for our drinks. She was rude and all over the place. We would have spent a lot of money but she deterred us from that.	0
So I stumbled into this Giant Eagle Market District on my way home from Trader Joe's.  (Note: The only grumble I have with TJ is lack of everyday essentials and I was suprised to learn that TJ doesn't stock dry beans).  So I am headstrong about making lentil soup that day and instead of going to Whole Foods (see past review).\n\nI have been to the South Hills GE Market District before.  I actually enjoy the experience of walking around HUGE stores that overwhelm me with variety and random things.  Thus is the experience of GE Market District.  You are in a full-service grocery store that caters to all income levels.  AND you get FUEL POINTS for wasabi-covered soy beans.  Fantastic!  They give you a map of the store, which is truly needed, because the variety and stock is endless.  The parking at the Shadyside GE is sort of hectic.  Making a left out of the parking lot is pretty difficult.  I enjoy these new Giant Eagle grocery-monopoly attempts.	1
The nicest full-range grocery I've ever seen.  With, well, a catch.  \n\nIt's the flagship store for the Giant Eagle chain, and they're strongly competing against the Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, both less than a mile away.  They stock a large number of quirky items you normally would only see at specialty stores, and the produce section is amazing.  The employees in the produce section are also amazing, as many of them can spout off a recipe for any particular item they sell, with a story and a smile.\n\nThat said, the traffic in and out of this place is pretty rough, and the prices on random items are much higher than you might expect, while the average price of items are actually pretty darn good.  Hummus is ridiculously expensive.  Juice is cheap.  Dunno.\n\nEvery time we go here, we come out highly stressed, which sucks.  The parking lot, traffic, and lines all make for a bad time, so I shop elsewhere unless I really need something that other places don't stock.	0
Dude, the other reviewers were NOT kidding about the parking.  I'm not a big fan of carrying orange juice up hills in the rain, but I think it would be worth it to not have to attempt to park in that insane asylum known as the giant eagle parking lot.\n\nGiant eagle pita chips lose to Trader Joe's.  They got groceries though, lots of groceries!  I like being able to buy marketplace hummus dip AND toilet paper.  This place might beat out trader joe's for me for regular grocery trips, when I have to buy like, lettuce, and shampoo.	1
The parking lot is a clusterfuck.\n\nThe entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk. \n\nThey usually have everything except what I am looking for and/or I just can't find it because it is not placed with similar things. Like when I went looking for organic hot cocoa mix...a week later I found it, not with the other hot cocoa mixes, but very randomly on it's own display at the end of the Asian foods isle. Gnocci? Not with the frozen Italian things, but with the other frozen Italian things...\n\nAnd then when I finally find that one item that I desperately wanted enough to look for it here, I face the crazy check out lines where one has plenty of time to analyze a disturbing cross-section of consumer society, at which point I often re-think my desire for the superfluous item in hand, set it down and swear to never return to this store again.	0
If they actually actually kept the store stocked, this would be a 4 star review.  However, I fight the traffic, parking lot, people with baskets, elevator, and rest of the customers to get to the bulk spices, Mexican section & produce only to find 100% of the things I need not stocked. So incredibly frustrating!\n  They do have a nice cheese section, bakery, prepared food section & juice bar.	0
Gotta say, this particular location of Giant Eagle (Market District) was the best Giant Eagle I've been to. Impressive selection of cheeses. Decent international section (although, Wegmans always surprises me! I'm talking mainly Asian stuff.)  Also was the place I became addicted to redbox DVDs.\n\nI always enjoyed the festive events they have going on once in a while. The one that I went to was in celebration of fall - they would decorate the store, even had some live musician near the doorway, give away samples of pie and cookies. Felt really nice to be welcomed into the store that way. \n\nThe only bad thing I'd say about this Giant Eagle is the clusterfuck of a parking lot they have. It's right off of a fairly busy street right by an intersection. They do have a parking garage, but you still have to wait in a line to get there because you're waiting for other people to park/reverse out of their space in front of you.	1
Selection of specialty and regular items is quite good. BUT, the layout, checkout and parking lots are literally the worst clusterfuck I've seen outside of New Delhi. Not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow.	0
So I decided to go on a cooking and baking frenzy and this place had everything I needed in the recipes I had. I had to find these three different types of cheese to make my lasagna from scratch and the guy working at the cheese area was very helpful. He even helped me get a grated version of one of the cheeses since I didn't want to go through the hassle of grating the block of cheese. The worker at the seafood counter was also nice and friendly. I could literally spend hours here if I could due to all the variety of food selection they have here. I definitely will be back for the huge variety of pickles they sell in their barrels! This place reminds me of a Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and your typical grocery market all combined in one. I even love how they have a wine vending machine in the front!	1
Store has a lot to choose from, but we have had HORRIBLE service from the bakery.  Went into the store three times to order our wedding cake, left my contact info only to have no one call back - I finally get someone who can talk with me about a cake at 9am on a Sunday morning, and now they can't do it on a week's notice.  I called the Giant Eagle Marketplace in Robinson, they said no problem, come into the store, we'll have someone to meet you, we'll figure something out.\n\nI guess the snotty people in the Shadyside store just don't need my business.	0
"I guess you pay for what you get...and in this case you get \""The Market District\"" marque.  I don't have much time to write a full review so I'll just post one experience:  I went to this store to purchased smoked turkey necks and/or wings to make soup.  the small package was 11.00 dollars.  I don't remember the poundage, but I remember it was enough meat to make a pot of soup.\n\nI went to the Giant Eagle that was RIGHT DOWN THE STREET, and a similar package of smoked turkey was 3 bux.\n\n:-/"	0
I'm completely bewildered by the bad reviews I've read.  I am new to Pittsburgh and until recently I always shopped at Dorothy Lane Market, rated the best gourmet grocery store in the country last year. I am impressed with Giant Eagle and some of the items they carry--Jeni's Ice Cream, Talenti Gelato, Montgomery Inn barbecue sauce and great fresh fried chicken.  There are strange items missing though...white corn, brining kits, chicken cloth, thick cut peppered bacon, fresh calves liver, tulips, anchovy stuffed peppers at the antipasto bar, store made salad dressings, pico de gallo for instance.  And in spite of having a HUGE kosher section they do not carry Empire brand frozen chicken fat (schmaltz). Back home if you asked for something they would order it for you.  My only negative experience at Giant Eagle  was with the Kosher deli associate who wasn't at all helpful along these lines. Everyone else has been great! Including the store security guard who helped me find things my first time in the store.	1
Always busy!  Selection of veggies are ok.  Selection of fruit is a little below average.  Otherwise it has everything you'd expect from a chain grocery store.\n\nMain complaint with this location is that the organization of aisles and products are not logical.  You often see items in multiple locations because the layout of the store was clearly not thought out.	0
Some people go crazy over this location, me, I just go crazy because of this location.\n\nI hate it, from the congestion in the parking lot to the congestion in every single aisle inside the store.  People are correct that this place has a larger selection of products, but forget your conventional set up for a grocery store.  You would think with this being a Market District.  It would be an easy endeavor.\n\nThis location is a place that I would visit for only one thing, definitely not a place I would regularly stop at, unless I lived within walking distance.	0
I want to like this location for a number of reasons: they have a chef on site doing cooking demonstrations and handing out samples. The staff is really nice when it's crowded. They're a Market District location, so they've got a good amount of prepared (or 'oven-ready') foods. It's close to my house.\n\nBut going here is ALWAYS such a nightmare.\n\nThe parking lot is miserable. There's a tiny lot area, and then an underground parking garage, but both are a pain to navigate and find a space in. I have never been here when there wasn't a long wait at the deli (and the deli order machine is always down, so you really have no choice but to wait in the line). The aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size. \n\nThis store has a lot of potential, and it *is* the biggest GE in the immediate city area, but I always leave frazzled and anxious, so I'd rather just make the drive to the suburbs for my Giant Eagle shopping trip.	0
"The GE is overly-large and over-priced. Yes, I have seen the food same item at other neighborhood GE's for less. For those of us who like to \""shop the perimeter\"" of the grocery store (meaning where the real food lives), and for those of us who do not like their grocery store to feel like an airport, this store is not good. I realize I am in the minority, however. Most people want bigger, more, more expensive (if they notice). And they put up with a bad parking lot and long check out lines, too. \n\nHonestly, I prefer the (gasp) East Lib/ Shakespeare St. GE. I can always park right outside the door and have had no problems with the produce, the dairy items or the service."	0
The produce here is always beaten to a pulp and expensive. We only get it here for convenience. The romaine is especially pitiful. We complained (finally) and received an apology and an offer for free cotton candy flavored grapes. We never did redeem our grape offer (as Snape would say, 'Pity',) and we haven't bought romaine here since we started getting the bulk of our groceries from Aldi for less. They have a large selection here and the generic brand goods are, well, good, but it's still pretty pricey. We head to Aldi first and get whatever's still on the list at GE, but we're getting less and less here. Overall thought on Giant Eagle: MEH.	0
The good: large selection. \nThe bad: the crazy high prices, missing price labels, inconvenient location. \nIt's come to the point that I avoid this place if I can. Aldi's is better for the basics and Pearl Market in the Strip district has better produce for 4x cheaper than this place.	0
"I don't care for this Giant Eagle, and that is being kind. The only reason I ever go here is for a quick item or two. My ideas for grabbing something in a \""quick\"" manner always end up being terrible because there is nothing quick about this place. The staff is generally unfriendly except for a few employees (2 or 3) who are always wonderful and helpful.\n\nNo one seems to enjoy working here at all, and there are always soooo many lines because there are never more than three to four aisles open at any given time, even on weekends.\n\nEverything is overpriced, except they will occasionally have deals on soda and greek yogurt."	0
Another bad experience.  The staff is sloppy.  The deli doesn't mark the product and passes off whatever slimey old crap they're trying to get rid of as what you ordered.  And good luck parking.	0
I got tired of waiting in line with one register open and 10 people in front of me. Won't be back.	0
Items don't have price tags. That's the only reason why I gave them such a poor mark. I hope that caught their attention. \n\nI try to buy produce and a lot of times many of the items I seem to select have no price tags, price stickers, barcode, name of produce and per/lb info. none of that. It's not listed anywhere and when I ask an associate they themselves don't know. Now please don't try retraining them because your associates are very kind and generous this is a corporate issue. \n\nSame goes for milk, cold cuts and breakfast meat products. \n\nEggs sometimes have poor labels placed in odd locations confusing the customer and forcing them to go on an Easter Egg hunt for the right price. \n\n\nThey also have fake sales. Placing price tags that are actually higher then the week before and claiming 'you are saving'.\n\nIt's close and convenient. \n\nPrices are a bit high. \n\nAssociates are so kind. They are generous, considerate and very polite. \n\nI still like them. I'm there every week.	0
"I needed Italian bread for an event so there was no choice except to buy the bread that was available. The bakery had plenty of Italian bread but therein lies the problem- I buy Italian bread on an almost weekly basis so I know the way it's supposed to look as well as cost. For about the third maybe fourth time now the bread yeast hasn't risen all the way. It looks like squashed sourdough bread instead of Italian bread. Instead of about 4\""-5\"" it's about 2\"" thick. To add insult to injury the bread even costs more during the times it was thinner. Instead of the bread costing $2.49 just like any other day it cost $2.69 when it's thinner. Does that make any sort of logical sense? I am disappointed and this review is emotional in nature but there are actual facts here as well."	0
Everyone complains about how expensive Whole Foods is in this area, but I find the Market District to be even more expensive for lesser quality. I despise going to this location, it is always packed with the rudest people imaginable and the employees act like they have anywhere better to be than at work. I have worked in a grocery store before and it is not always the most pleasant, but the way I have been treated there everytime I go is beyond imagining. Giant Eagle has managed to monopolize grocery stores in this area and kept out other chains I would prefer such as Wegman's. The produce here is subpar and anytime I do buy it I end up with a swarm of fruit flies at my house. I once saw a tomato display crawling with hundreds of them and the employees did nothing. Go to Whole Foods and buy their store brand, you'll save yourself money and be around employees who are enthusiastic to help.	0
I mean, how many stars can you really give a laundromat? This place smells like mildew constantly.. Like, since I've been going, it's never NOT smelled like mildew. I'd like to think that a place you go to clean things..should be clean? Guess not. Anyway, the people who work here are courteous and nice, if that matters.	0
Best place in the city for drop off laundry I've found so far. Period.	1
Fun store! Though I just spent a couple minutes here while my husband was browsing, I loved the old fashioned vibe. Plus, the owner seemed to be very hands-on. Not only was she helping a lot of customers find particular items, but I heard a couple customers even address her by name as they entered.	1
I was able to come in, pick out 3 tops that were really nice when they were clearly really busy and they got me a dressing room within seconds upstairs in the mens department. The staff was really helpful and accommodating when I asked if they had a different size. I will certainly be back for some more clothes.	1
Decent price on domestic pitchers. Entrees were half off but all looked mediocre. Tried the jambalaya and it was so so. Big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service.	0
Hey Doc!\n\nI dig your deck.  And I also like specials that involve a $7 pitcher of good beer!\n\nOh, and great service!\n\nThanks for all that!\nMichael E	1
"Doc's is a decent place in the Spring and Summer, when their 2nd floor upstairs patio is open. They have reasonably priced pitchers of beer and well drinks. It's nice to sit outside and relax after a long day of school or work.\n\nThe beer selection isn't that great and the upstairs bar is not full. Sometimes their drink \""specials\"" are served in tiny plastic cups. The service can also be rather slow.\n\nI am not a big fan of their food (pizzas are bland and the burgers overcooked), although it is nice to split an appetizer with a group of people."	0
Nice place. I like it.	1
Platinum Blonde Perfection.  Jay works wonders and he has given me the best platinum blonde 'do ever.  It was gorgeous.  My hair looked like corn silk.  If I had boat-loads of money, I'd fly him out to LA every 6 weeks for a touch up.   Go to see Jay...tell him Laura from LA sent you.	1
"The pedicures at DeStefinos  are a complete rip-off. IMO\n\nWhen I booked the $53 pedicure, I was told\n(1) it would last an hour ,  and would\n(2) include  a foot massage   \n\nNot true:  the manicurist was done in 45 minutes.  and \nThe advertised  foot massage consisted of a quick rub of my feet and lower leg, finished in two minutes or less.  \n\nWhen the manicurist was done, I complained that\nmy feet were still rough.  \""You can't possibly expect your feet\nto be smooth after only one pedicure.\""\n\nExcuse me?  and why not?  Every other pedicure I've had\n(for much less money) got my feet smooth,"	0
Great salon for hair...not so much nails. My hair stylist Vanessa is great. I can go in without a clear picture of what I want and she gives me exactly what I wanted. I get so many compliments on my hair.	1
Although this store has great employees, it is in desperate need of a makeover.  It is absolutely ghetto inside.  I don't think they've redone the store since the early 90s.  It's an embarrassment on Walnut.	0
I do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that I want, but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items. And the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him! He can help you a lot.	1
This is a great shop in Shadyside with a little something for everyone.  It has lots of statuary, candles, and free trade items.  The second floor is simply filled with books on all sorts of subjects.  They seem to specialize in recovery - from addiction, abuse, etc., but they also have an even larger collection of self help and metaphysical subjects.  It's a nice local store to support when you're in the area.	1
This feels like one of those places that are tucked away and is somewhat of an adventure for you to find. Walking Walnut in Shadyside you usually don't think to walk down the side streets unless you have a purpose for doing so.\n\nJourneys, not to be confused with the chain shoe store, has a nice mix of items. From gems and incense, to books and art. It took us a while to browse the shelves as there was so much to look over. Walking through here as well makes you think that you are walking through someones personal pintrest page in real life.\n\nThe book selection upstairs is a lot of self help, guidance type of reads. Good if you have a job where you are there to help people. They also have educational board games that would be good for children (don't read that as boring either).\n\nWhy not five stars?  I'm a bit skeptical of a place that sells items that are to help you cure yourself when it's not medication.  But that shouldn't deter people from coming here.	1
Tiffany prices with Kay Jewelers selection.\n\nI've gone to this place a couple of times to look for various items over the past few years.  Every time I leave the store I always try to remind myself never to come back.\n\nThe prices are way more than what they should be.  Tacori rings and other merchandise is marked up about 30-40% more than other jewelry stores in Pittsburgh.\n\nI've had a couple of nice salespeople work with me, but some of the others were just plain rude.  They try to do a great job preying on Love by upselling items or addons that aren't even necessary.\n\nThere are many other great jewelry stores in Pittsburgh that you can look at other than here.	0
I just accepted a beautiful ring from Hennes. I have had nothing but compliments and I must say that the ring was beautiful. Unfortunately within 4 days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing. I'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of. But my new fianc\u00e9 is very upset by this.	0
Cozy and comfortable, our food was really good, and the waitstaff friendly and efficient!\n\nThe mussels were great (garlic madness) and they split some entrees for us in the kitchen. wowowow.\n\nWill definitely try and revisit next time I'm in Pittsburgh.	1
"Girasole is probably my favorite restaurant in the Walnut St. corridor.  I specifically want to talk about their salad.  I know this charming and cozy Italian restuarnt is not a one trick pony (their various Raviolis being especially exceptional) but their signature Girasole Salad is really something special.  In Italian the word \""Girsole\"" means \""Sunflower,\"" a flavor that really comes through in this salad.  Not only is the salad sprinkled in sunflowers, the dressing is made of some blend of sunflower oil and vinegar and really makes the salad stand out from its peers.  I have thought this dressing so deliciously tangy and unique, I've bought it from the restaurant in a bottle on more than one occasion.  Served in a generous helping, you can order the salad with chicken or shrimp, which are always tender and succulent.  Red onions and gorgonzola really complete the flavor experience.  Really, it's the number one salad in town."	1
I recently had a horrible experience at Girasole. I used to really enjoy going to this restaurant due to its cozy atmosphere and decent Italian food. However, this past visit was unfortunate. The host was horrendous and extremely rude. I had brought my parents, who were visiting from out of town, and they were appalled at how rude the host was. Girasole is usually quite busy but it was also disorganized. I had made a reservation and arrived early knowing that there would be a wait. However, we saw three tables be seated prior to us, all of which had arrived much after us. When we tried to tell the hostess, he was even more rude than when we had arrived. To be honest, I could have overlooked the seating other parties prior to us if we had at least been given a friendly smile or a warm welcome. \n\nRegarding the food, it is adequate, nothing in comparison to other much more exciting and fulfilling Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.	0
We were disappointed. A client recommended Girasole to us on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. While the food was alright (not spectacular) our waitress was the worst and for some reason, on the warmest day of summer, the a/c was not on. Everyone in our party was schvitzing and trying hard not to ask our waitress to drop the attitude.\n  \nThe food was fine, but again, when the rest of the experience is poor it really doesn't matter how good the food is. We won't be back.	0
They need to take out about 4-5 of the tables they have packed in this place - Way to crowded.    Not to mention there was a guy singing and playing an accordion on the night we went for dinner.  Would have been fine except for the fact that there are 10 people too many in the place to begin with and then he wanders around the dining floor going table to table.  Wanted to pay the guy to stop for 30 min while I ate!\n\nPasta dishes are way overpriced and honestly not that great.  $20 for noodles and meat sauce... \n\nDinner specials/entrees are your best bet and were very good. but also way over prices.    Didn't have desert but multiple people in my dinner party raved about one of the cakes they had.  \n\n Simply put - this place does not execute the level of food their price points represent.  I'm all for paying for a good meal but when it falls short.... and this place does!\n\nOverall a very disapointing night out.	0
For my 100th review...I'm taking it back home. \n\nGirasole is a lovely little italian restaurant tucked away in a basement on Copeland Street. They have outdoor seating that is secluded from all the hustle and bustle on Walnut Street so it's definitely ideal for a date in the summer. Our service was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredibly attentive. \n\nMy friend and I split a bottle of chianti and started off with some delicious escarole and beans. The escarole was still slightly al dente and was swimming in a pool of beans with garlicy, plump fresh tomatoes . We asked for extra bread twice to sop up all of the juicy goodness. \n\nWe also split the bruschetta, which came styled with ricotta cheese. It was also delicious. \n\nI picked the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which were large little pillows of warm goodness. I think there were only 4, but they were huge and also swimming in another delicious sauce. The herbs were so fresh and delightful in this dish. \n\nEverything at Girasole is rustic and bursting with flavor. Anytime I'm home I come back for an enjoyable meal in the sun. Classic Italian food.	1
What is there to say about Girasole? An Italian owner who wanders around the restaurant (often with a glass of wine) greeting friends and customers and kibitzing with staff; a friendly staff; and fantastic food. Seriously, the food is great. Order anything on the menu & you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe best part about Girasole, though, is the intimate indoor & outdoor atmosphere & the wine. Pours are generous, and there's a fantastic selection to choose from. If you're having difficulty, your server will be happy to help you, too (ask for Ryan). Did I mention the wine? Seriously, the pours are generous, and if you MUST bring your own, bring a lot, because the corking fee is very reasonable.	1
We just ate our way through 12,000 miles of road trip across the US and back. This was, hands down, the best restaurant we tried. Service was exceptional. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting. And the food was out of this world fresh and good.\n\nI had a spinach pasta with sweet corn, baby tomatoes, and fresh basil. It's my new favorite pasta in the world, so fresh and savory, with just the right combo of tangy and sweet. \n\nThe house salads were exceptionally fresh and full of good veggies and cheese. My son said his pasta, penne with sausage, was terrific. The bread was great.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing to complain about in this dining experience. Even better, it was the kind of meal that made us want to go back to Pittsburgh, just to eat here again.\n\nAnd it was a great deal -- $44 including tax, tip, and drinks for two people -- for a whole lot of fantastic food.	1
Really disappointing. Service is bad when you enter. If it is busy expect to be treated poorly. Have a reservation? That will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else. Once seated servers are pleasant and nice,\n\nThe food is poor. Verges on disgusting. I had their much-beloved squid ink linguine with lobster. The pasta was mushy--way overcooked. Far too much cream and cheese. Lobster meat suspiciously tasted like it was recently thawed out from a frozen state. Didn't finish this dish.\n\nMy wife had a chicken special. Dry. Boring. Bland.\n\nMaybe we just had a bad experience (it was a busy Friday night 8pm). The popularity of the place and the plethora of positive reviews and high ratings indicates that this might have some great moments, but unfortunately not this time.	0
This is the place I imagine sneaking into on an evening spent with that charming someone who captures your heart with the slightest smile. Late spring, strolling along the cobblestone streets window shopping when the sky darkens, and the clouds open up. Huddled under an umbrella, his arm around you to warm you from the sudden chill, you scamper down the few steps and duck into the warmth of Girasole.\n\nYou're immediately greeted like family; with a glow in the background as if a huge fire were burning. The small space is filled with lovely folks laughing, and sharing wine; eyes twinkling as they listen to the live music being played by the gentleman walking around strumming his guitar singing loudly.\n\nThe menu is simply simple Italian. The wine list is the sweet red table wine offered immediately after you sit down. The desserts are so worthy of the extra calories. Home made and delightful. \n\nAlmost as tasty as that good night kiss.	1
This is one of the, not the best kept secrets, in Shadyside.  Solid Italian food, great atmosphere both inside and out, and family owned and run. Have eaten here dozens of times, and never had a bad meal. If there was only one criticism, it might be the drink selection. By that I mean cocktails.  There's not a dedicated bartender, and the drinks are made by the servers who are already too busy.  The wine selection is small but has something for most budgets and is pretty good.	1
Food was excellent but we hated the ambiance! Reservations at 7:00 pm Saturday. Arrived on time. Couldn't get in the door to wait for them to clear table because there were so many people in the narrow entrance; had to stand outside in cold weather. The place was so loud, we couldn't hear our waitress and thus the specials or the people we were seated with. Everyone is back to back; no place to hang a coat or move between tables to visit the restroom. We won't go back.	0
Pretty darn tasty. Walked in on a whim after a busy night shopping on Walnut and enjoyed the food immensely. It's a noisy and busy atmosphere but that was fine since it was fun to talk a bit to our neighbors. \n\nJust don't expect a romantic, quiet evening to yourself.	1
Always a pleasure to eat at this place. I've never had a bad meal.\n\nThanks bob	1
From the other reviews I really had high expectations for this Italian restaurant - was hoping for some authentic Italian food. Not the case. Not a lot of pasta options and those that were on the menu weren't homemade. \n\nIt's unlikely I will return because the food was mediocre, the service was very slow and the prices were high.	0
The receptionist was ver unwelcoming even on the phone. Very rude. This is my first review, I have never been so annoyed . I wanted to ask a few things before I come for dinner, but the guy just hung up on me. Thanks.	0
"My boyfriend and I had just casually walked by Girasole to see what their menu looked like. Before we even asked for a menu, the front of house staff quickly asked us whether or not we wanted to sit outside squished behind a baby's highchair in a corner or inside where it was very crowded. We tried to politely ask the man if we could see a menu first. After looking at the menu we decided we liked what the menu had on it, but it was just really crowded. When we returned the menu to the front of the house staff he snatched the menu away from us and said, \""Yeah I knew you guys weren't going to buy anything anyway\"". What if we were about to order something? That completely turned us away from this restaurant. We could tell we were just another group of people to get in and get out. Very rude and unacceptable. Never going back."	0
Food here is out of this world good.  The venue is extremely charming too.  Service was a disappointment.  Couldn't help but get the feeling that we were annoying our waitress just by being patrons.  Speed was fine, food was great, but I don't like apologizing just because I chose to eat in your restaurant.	1
Great food, great location, ok service. Sometimes you have to wait for a table despite your reservation. It has a great Italian atmosphere and everyone is talking loudly which makes it a great place for a date or a dinner with friends.	1
LOUD!\n\nWhen someone says the name Girasole's - that's the first thing that pops into my head. So loud you have to essentially shout to have a conversation with your table-mate. Small place, so everything is pretty cramped together. \n\nService is quick, genuine, and attentive. Food was slightly above average but far from memorable - just not worth putting up with the noise level over. Perhaps for takeout....\n\nHad the greens and beans w/ the Cappa Santa.	0

Awful service. We made reservations 4 weeks  and when we showed up the host yelled at us because they were over booked and his excuse was it was God's fault because the weather took away his outdoor seating. He also didn't offer us an apology and kept on telling us where we couldn't stand. The most annoying part is that he was drinking a glass of wine the entire time while shuffling people around! Wish we could have tried the food, but there is only so much indifference one can handle.	0
Lovely atmosphere, friendly and attentive waitstaff, just a bit crammed--you sit very close to the neighboring tables.  Great meals all around, we will be back!	1
After looking for an occasion to go here for a few months, we finally went for my birthday dinner. It was a Sunday evening and the restaurant was quite busy. The area is kind of small and crowded, there was a large party near us which was making a lot of noise.\n\nDespite the crowd, the food was delicious! The starter goat cheese salad was the best salad I have ever had, and may have been better than the pasta..I had the lamb meatballs with cavatelli which was yummy. The lamb was moist and flavorful. I also had a few bites of the penne pasta with marinara sauce and chicken. You could tell the sauce was fresh and made from scratch since it was so sweet. Complimentary bread was good too.\n\nWould definitely go again, maybe on a weekday when it may be less crowded and noisy.	1
Excellent, We went last night to celebrate my parents 40th Anniversary.  Food was great! Our server Rachael did a awesome job.  The restaurant had neat character,it was a bit loud but it is small, so that's expected.  Wonderful all around.	1
Beautiful ambiance, fantastic service, delicious food, and a personal toast from the owner was a great touch!	1
"The owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience.  I arrived with my parents at 6pm, just as it stated to get busy.  We submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins.  As tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations.  It was like we were invisible.  As the wait approached 40 min I went up to him and asked how many reservations there were and if he had any idea how much longer it would be.  He looked at me, mumbled a sentence with the word \""ridiculous\"" and said he didn't know.  I politely told him it wasn't a big deal and said he could remove our name from the list.  As we were leaving he came out the door and said we could sit outside (it was 50 degrees with a chance of rain).\n\nOnly reason I'm leaving this review is because my mom was all worked up and felt disrespected.\n\nI just can't support business owners like this.  Go elsewhere."	0
funky little cafeteria atop a very popular pittsburgh breakfast spot. it's BYOB - always nice - and the food is abundant and tasty. very casual, small menu, good, attentive service. plus they have a little shop with peruvian gifts, including an incas vs. spanish chess game, fluffy mini-llamas, and bright woven goods.	1
I really love this joint. It is small and casual. The menu changes regularly, and there is always a vegetarian option. I'm surprised it isn't more crowded because I can't really thing of a negative thing to say about the place. The salad is yummy, and I'm not even a salad person. I think my favorite dish here thus far has been the Peruvian corn. The atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front.	1
Lovely, refreshing food, though the menu gets a bit old. Perfect, unique salad dressing. Must try it!	1
While I'm not going to crave this food, it was pretty good.  It tasted like home-made Peruvian food, not that I've ever had Peruvian food, or been in the home of a Peruvian.  But it is what I imagine I would have eaten if I grew up in Lima.\n\nI think it's a very reasonable alternative on the Walnut Street strip, especially if you don't want to shell out the $$$ for Panagea or Girasole.	1
Had the chicken here. Was somehow unevenly cooked and bland. So bland. Friend had a vegetarian special, which was better, but still unimpressive. Realize it was only 12$ for dinner, and yet somehow still entirely not worth it.	0
I would recommend this place for a quick lunch. I ordered the non-vegetarian special of the day, cilantro chicken with rice, french bread, and salad. The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but it still had great flavor. My meal was $11 (pre-tax and tip) which I thought was fair considering that the salad was extremely fresh and there was a decent amount of meat.	1
If you can't find this place, it's because it's above Pamela's.  I liked all the crafts in here.  It was cute, lots of different things, colorful clothes, toy llamas, etc.  But, I really came here for the Peruvian food.\n\nIf you are looking for Papas a la Huancaina or ceviche, it isn't here.  It's salads, sandwiches, empanadas, and a few other entrees like arroz tapado.  \n\nThis is a good place for a healthy lunch but I would not come here for dinner.  After looking at the menu and nothing jumped at me, I got the empanada platter.  It was...ok.  Not that amazing.  I got the beef, the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas.  The cilantro wasn't even that prevalent in the chicken empanada.  My spinach empanada was comparable to a less flaky spanakopita.  The beef empanada need more flavor!  Sigh.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this place.\n\nI will say, the coffee was good and the server was very pleasant.  This is a nice place to get some cool gifts.	0
I've had a lot of things both dry cleaned and altered at this place (several hundred dollars worth). He is consistently late and there were a  couple of instances where I had to take stuff back to be re-done. I've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced. I will never go back though. The straw that broke the camels back for me was the most recent time when I had him alter two suits. We agreed on two weeks to complete the work. I came back in three and he hadn't even started. He told me the earliest he could do it was another week and then was late again. Seriously? How hard is this? I am now going to start a search for a more reliable place.	0
They always take weeks to get things done & overcharged. I was ok with that when they did a good job. But then they stopped doing a good job. Not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job.	0
I've been there twice to have dress clothes tailored. The first was for a full suit and a pair of pants. The owner said to return the following Saturday, which I did, and he did not have them ready. Not only that, but he acted like it was my fault I showed back up on time. \n\nSecond time same deal, two pairs of pants, not done on time and when they were done they were not tailored correctly. I'll be going out of my way to a different tailor from now on. \n\nIn addition, the prices are on the very high side without the service or results.	0
"I brought two pairs of pants and two (cheap) blazers there to be altered.  He was very nice. However, he failed to mention to me that the cost of these 4 things- one of which only needed alternation tape- would come to $96!!!!!!  When I came to pick up my items I was extremely embarrassed because I had to tell him I could not afford it. He then told me he could \""help me out \"" and make it $80.  I tried explaining to him that the two blazers were only $25 each to begin with.  Overall, this was an extremely humiliating experience and it all could have been solved if he were more professional and would have told me that simple alterations would cost so much.  I will definitely be searching for a new tailor in the future.  Way too expensive if you ask me."	0
I went there to get my dress hemmed last Wednesday and he said the next Thursday and when I went it to get it the day it was supposed to be done, he hadn't even started and he told me he was working on it right now which was a bold face lie. And when I went back to get it, he charged me for 30 for a simple dress hemming. It is such a rip off. I won't ever go back there.	0
I've had many suits, pants, and sport coats altered here. Rocky is a very nice guy who gets things done on time and does great work!\n\nIt would be a little more convenient if the establishment wasn't cash only, but in my experience the best places are.	1
I've visited Molnar Service Center many times. My first visit was to have my VIN number verified for car registration, and Molnar's took care of me very quickly! I was in and out in under five minutes. \n\nMy second visit was to get my car inspected. I dropped my car off in the morning and it was finished that afternoon. I wasn't going to be able to arrive by the time the shop closed, so they made arrangements so I could pick up my car after hours.\n\nMy third visit was this week. I had a hissing noise that turned out to be a vacuum leak in the pump for my power breaks. The pump had to be replaced and the part needed to be ordered. It was estimated that my car would be finished by Friday afternoon. But they finished it by Thursday afternoon!\n\nI feel like I always get great service at Molnar's. They always explain the problem, and have always finished on schedule or ahead of schedule for me. My car will always go to Molnar's for service.	1
This business closed July 31st 2014!!	0
I recently took my engagement ring into The Collection for resizing and I had a very nice experience there. The ring belonged to my fiance's great grandmother and has a delicate setting and band. My ring finger is a good deal smaller than the ring's past owner, however, and the ring needed to be sized down from a 7 to a 3 and 3/4. I was a bit worried that such a large reduction would alter the shape and/or design of the ring. However it all worked out beautifully. Karen and everyone else in the shop were all very kind and provided lots of information. The job took less than two hours and the price was very reasonable. I am hoping to return there to have our wedding rings made.	1
They work quickly, but speed isn't worth it if the final product is damaged.	0
i think this is the right place.. near the shopping center? kind of a hole in the wall? i was a little put off by how dirty the place seemed, but the pizza was DELICIOUS. nice and crispy, just like i like it. not stingy on the toppings while not overwhelming the pizza either.	1
Thank you to Bonnie T. who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S. Aiken Ave.  I will leave my review there!  BTW that move also came with a name change - they are now S. Aiken Bar and Grille.\n\nI was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed.  When I read that they had moved - I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say 'Village Pizza'.	1
I still get nightmares from just seeing Mozart management signs on\nBuildings anywhere in Pittsburgh.	0
One of the worst mgmt companies i have ever dealt with.  The policies in their building are obviously very outdated but they refuse to make themselves better to serve their clients.  As long as they can wipe their hands clean, they are ok with it.  One aspect that they are great at is dishing off responsibility and making zero effort to give the tenants a better experience.  Mgmt does not think how to resolve the issue, instead they will cite a policy to justify why they cannot help you.	0
I have lived in the Pennsylvania building for over 3 months now and I felt a need to counter act all these negative reviews I keep seeing on here.\n\nFirstly when I called maintenance to fix anything I would always get a prompt response usually within 24 hours. I remember my mailbox lock needed changed and 2 hours later a maintenance man came up to check and order a new one. \n\nPeople say Mozart has came into their apartment unannounced but that hasn't happened to us yet and Pennsylvania doesn't have a law requiring management companies to notice tenants when they will be coming over. So if you want a company to respect that you'll have to leave the state.  \n\nAll the maintenance, management, and grounds keepers have been very polite and knowledgeable to my roommate and I.\n\nBe sure to read all of the lease before signing. They have all the information in their leases.	1
Mozart Management  is great! They have been extrememly professional and considerate the whole time I have rented. I have been renting for years and they are the best property management company I've had. Stacey, the property manager, has been very responsive any email I send her and goes out of her way to make tenants' lives easier. I couldn't ask for anything more out of a property management company.	1
Absolutely horrible. My sink has been overflowing onto my countertops and ruining my belongings multiple times. Management did not even apologize for my inconvenience.	0
When damaging your liver it's best to use only the freshest and best quality ingredients and if you want to do some serious damage then you should definitely check out Mardi Gras.  \n\nThey freshly squeeze the oranges and grapefruits in front of you for your Screwdrivers and Greyhounds so you don't have to worry about nasty impurities from the fruit juice ruining your cocktail.  Why make your liver work harder than it already has to.	1
Strong drinks, dark and smoky, cozy booths, great juke box.  This is a bar, this is your neighborhood bar.  If you need to meet someone for a drink and just talk it out - this is the place.  A good friend of mine always points out the ugly carpet.  Yep, the carpet here is ugly, but at least it is new.  And the place is dark so you never really see the carpet anyways.	1
So Mardi Gras was usually a must stop whenever I went out on a Friday or Saturday night in Shadyside during college. This bar is more of an older crowd but they do serve drinks the way I usually make mine. If you order a jack and coke, you'll be lucky if you can even taste the coke. They pretty much give you a glass of jack and a splash of coke. We used to get very very drunk here. The place is really small so you're lucky to see an open table, grab it. \n\nThe bartenders are older and they don't take credit card so bring cash. The drinks are also a little more expensive for Pittsburgh. However, this is the only place in the area that has Delirium Tremens on tap.\n\nThey don't serve food here either so plan on getting messed up if you don't eat anything before you go. The bar is very dark but a lot of my friends love this place and whenever alumni came back, we would definitely go here and make them pay for our drinks. All in all, a very good place to pregame or just to hang out and socialize.	1
Good luck getting out\nWith your soul and belongings.\nBring your own flashlight.\n\n\n(b)	0
Some serious old school 80's glamour waits up the long flight of stairs to Marti Gras.  There's something magical about this dive--even the smoke doesn't seem to bother me...Actually, it's probably the strong drinks that are responsible for that...Which may be made with magic.  Who can say?  But I'm a sucker for any sort of sweet vodka cocktail in a martini glass, and the drinks here will knock a girl off her heels.  Luckily, there's always an attentive bartender waiting to mix one more cocktail.\n\nBut this ain't no college dive.  You won't find too many kids in here, which I appreciate.  It's dark up those stairs and the jukebox jazz is often questionable, but the booths are cozy and the drinks are tall and the beer selection is more than decent.  I'll take it.\n\nP.S. - It was cash only last time I checked.	1
This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh! The drinks will punch you in the face, if that weird looking guy next to you won't. It's a great escape from the bro-scene that is most of Walnut St. and they have booths which themselves would be enough to make me love this place. I've had many sloppy nights here and made many stranger friends. Order a greyhound and watch the bartender squeeze fresh juice into your drink and kick it with strangers at the bar.	1
Do you want to be shitface drunk off of one drink and you only have $10?  go to Mardis Gras.\n\nTheir drinks are military grade weapons, that is how strong they are.  This bar is unlike every other bar in shadyside.  it's dark and it has cool round booths.\n\nthe bartender should be a national treasure, he is awesome.\n\nbring cash, you can't use your card there.\n\nOh--you will smell like smoke when you leave, this place is full of smoke.  It's likely the least sexy bar in all of pgh but its one of my favorites.	1
Wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks.  The bartender told us they were known for they fruity drinks, but not margaritas.  He could mix any juice with vodka.  We left.	0
Super super strong drinks. Very smoky and small, but definitely worth coming to.	1
.	0
In general, I am not a fan of Shadyside bars. Le Mardi Gras may be in Shadyside, but it is something else entirely.\n\nMardi Gras is a true dive bar, and not just compared to what's around it--this would be divey in any neighborhood. Drinks are cash only, there's a perpetual haze of smoke, and you'd better be an expert at navigating dim lighting if you hope to not trip over anyone. None are especially bad things. And in fact, the pros of Mardi Gras far outweigh these things. Great big booths, friendly bartenders, free wifi, and strong drinks.\n\nSpeaking of drinks: are you into fresh-squeezed juices? Do you like strong drinks? I mean really strong. Play it safe. Try a Greyhound, but make sure you have a designated driver. The bartenders almost take pride in the strength.\n\nAll in all, it's an authentic dive in a neighborhood that sorely needs one. Grab your cash, and bottoms up!	1
We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes, but these just don't taste good.  On top of it all, the coffee was horrible.  \n\nTry DeLuca for a diner experience or Crepe Parisiennes for a good crepe and coffee instead.	0
Pamela's is an East End institution.  Let's face it: if you've grown up, went to school or currently live in the area, you've probably spent a Sunday devoring forkfuls of Pamela's unique and delicious brand of pancake.  They are thin, crepe-like a little on the greasy side (in a good way). Quick service make up for the long lines.  Weekend specials are a must have.  My favorite is  the chocolate chip banana pancakes.  There is no place like Pamela's, anywhere.	1
Yes, the line runs out the door but you better believe it is worth the wait.  We had a table of three and we waited no longer than 10 minutes.  The chocolate chip banana pancakes are heavenly!! Everything comes out quick, fast and in a hurry which is imperative when you get into this place and your mouth starts drooling over your neighbors' meals.  The coffee is just so-so but honestly who cares in this case.  Enjoy!!	1
Best breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area.  Just make sure to bring cash - they don't take credit.	1
"Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is often a line in the morning on nice weekend days. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking \""I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1/4 of what I payed at Pamela's\""."	0
Wow I couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette, home fries, and rye toast, and it still kept me full from 11, when I had brunch, to 9PM!  Usually I hate homefries, but these were great!  I think I can only go here like once a year though, to prevent my heart from exploding.	1
The breakfast special here should be enough for most people. The pancakes are great. The service is generally very good too. The only bummer is the lines for this location (and all Pamela's locations in fact) are super long around brunch/lunch times.	1
delicate and fluffy jussssssst the way i like 'em! \n\nwait wasnt tooo bad (5-10 min maybe). its short if its just 2 ppl.\n\ni had the choc chip cookie pancake - melts in your mouth son!\n\ndef put me into a nice cozy nap mood tho. peep it out at least once.	1
After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious, except I only ate 1/4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake.  Pamela's turned out to be a waste of money for me and I left hungry.\n\nThere's nothing THAT great about Pamela's.  It's like breakfast at most any other diner.	0
Another help wanted sign and closed Memorial day. Ahhh	0
Great place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning after drinking way too much. The hotcakes are unbelievable but I am a really big fan of their home fries. I also really like their corned beef hash. I'll usually get some sort of omelette and pair it with a hotcake (usually chocolate but blueberry is pretty good too). I'll then make sure there is plenty of home fries and get a side of the corned beef hash. This usually puts me in a food coma but makes me feel fantastic especially after waking up a little hungover or still drunk from the night before.\n\nOh. you have to pay with cash. And this location is also pretty packed so there is usually a line up outside. But it's so worth it.	1
I live a few blocks from Pamela's and each time that I walk by on the weekends there seems to be quite a few people waiting (and others have raved) so had been wanting to try it for a while. After waiting 30-45  minutes on a Saturday morning for brunch, I wasn't that impressed. It is cheap, the service is fast and they serve ample buttery portions of diner food. If you're not hungover, I hope you have a good reason for going. You might as well just eat some grease and rub it all over your face.	0
Delicious as always.  What more can really be said?  I always get the crepe pancakes with brown sugar and sour cream.  I remember when you could only get them with strawberries, but blueberries are now an excellent alternative.\n\nTheir coffee is as spectacularly terrible as ever.  It's been bad for as long as I can remember, like they're intentionally not serving good coffee.  It's the only thing from keeping Pamela's from being a 5-star breakfast place.  Regardless, Pamela's is still a Pittsburgh classic and always a great breakfast destination.	1
Everything I wanted to say has already been covered in previous reviews, so I'll just leave it at this:\n\nOH MY GOD GET THE HOTCAKES\n\nSeriously, get them.	1
Pamela's is certainly a Pittsburgh institution, and for good reason! Of the several locations in the city, the Shadyside spot is my favorite, probably because it was the first Pamela's I ever ate at.  I love breakfast food, but I'm never big on breakfast-only places because they tend to be too small and crowded, and hardly worth the wait.  But Pamela's food is as close to perfection as you'll ever get, so the long line and cramped space isn't even a factor.  Personally, I love their hotcakes, omelets, and hash browns, but everything on the menu is mouth-watering and inexpensive!	1
How Pamela's became a Pittsburgh institution is completely beyond me. The food is average at best (think a step or two above Denny's or Waffle House). Pancakes were soggy and bland and the veggie omelete was chocked full of processed, cheese-like goo and assorted goodness straight out of a can.	0
Disgustingly amazing breakfast as usual. Order what you want and accept you are done for the day!	1
Decent breakfast and great service. I found the much touted corned beef hash to be too salty but everything else we ordered was great. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for breakfast	1
We had a terrible breakfast here not long ago. Like many couples in the city, we love to go out every other week or so for a weekend breakfast. This day, it wasn't busy, and the speed of service was good. The French toast was an abomination. The toast had about a quarter inch of egg white formed around the edges, from poorly mixed batter. Plus the bread was poor quality. The bacon...crunchy fleks of the thinnest, most meager bacon these eyes have seen. The crepe pancakes were ok, but nothing to write home about. Years ago I worked for a grumpy penny pincher who had been swindled into buying a 3 year supply of prepackaged coffee, which just sat in our storeroom for years until we brewed it, and cursed it. Van roots, it was. Pamela's, in all the years I Have visited, has consistently challenged van rooy for the worst coffee crown. On top of all the bad food, last week Pamela's earned that crown. We'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future.	0
Yo! Fucking brown sugar and blueberries in my hotcakes? Legit!	1
HOT CAKES.  That's really all I have to say.  I was wondering what the fuss was about, and when I took my first bite, it all made sense.  As for the rest of the breakfast items, they're okay.  I ordered corned beef hash, and it seemed like the kind of corned beef that came from a can.  I could be wrong, but it just didn't have much flavor.  The only annoying thing about this place is the wait.  Get there early or be prepared to wait, outside, for a long while.	1
Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap, and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food, and though it might taste OK a first, your digestive tract may say otherwise later. \n\nThe space was cramped, we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests, with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast, except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why, in this day and age, are you cash-only, Pamela?	0
"Ok! The best hash I have ever had. Their potatoes are \""bananas!\"""	1
I have always enjoyed going here for breakfast/brunch. In my younger years, I would go for the hotcakes. So thin, large, and crispy on the edges. Yummmyyy.\n\nI will write an update to this review...after I go to it again hopefully  next month...But if it is as good as I remember, you won't be sorry going here.	1
The food here is over the top excessively greasy. So greasy that it made me sick to my stomach before I was done eating my meal. My husband and I split the chocolate chip pancakes and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and toast on the side. Not only was everything in a pool of grease, but it seemed to be margarine...not even real butter. I will never eat here again. I am gagging even thinking about this meal let aloe eating it again.	0
Today was my second time at a Pamela's. During my first trip I made the mistake of 1)not ordering hot cakes 2) dining alone 3)not ordering hotcakes! \n\nI was worried about a wait for a Sunday morning but it was surprisingly only 15minutes. We were seated & greeted promptly. Both of us ordered the morning after breakfast with the strawberry pancakes. The potatoes /home fries were awesome & as another reviewer mentioned it feels as if every bite is different (&fabulous). \n\nSpeaking of fabulous, I'm thankful to have finally experienced the Pamelas hotcake. It was filled with fresh strawberries, sour cream, brown sugar bits.. & every bite was better than the last. Don't let that trio scare or fool you-.it's delicious \n\nNext weekend can't come fast enough to stop back\n\n...forgot to mention it took no time at all for 4 giant plates of food to reach our table.	1
"There are 2 types of \""Good\"" restaurants in Pittsburgh. There is Yinzer good and Actually good. This food is Yinzer good. Way too much butter and sugar. Yuck."	0
"Maybe \""yinzer good\"" isn't always such a bad thing. I went here the other morning and was quoted a 25-30 minutes wait time. It took 50 minutes. That seemed to be pretty standard so be prepared for that. Once we got in and ordered, the food came out almost immediately making the wait time more worth it. The hot cakes were delicious but be prepared for more buttery goodness than one should consume in a month. The potatoes were also half butter. I thought they tasted great if not a tad salty. The orange juice is more affordable than in most breakfast places but it wasn't mind blowing, I doubt it was fresh squeezed. My husband ordered eggs and hash which were also good but overly salty. We left feeling stuffed, guilty, and knowing that while the food was tasty our waistlines could only handle eating there once every couple of months."	1
Pamela's is the hottest thing in Pittsburgh, and they have lines of an hour long, going out the door, they don't take reservations, But I'm not sure why they have such high ratings. After waiting for an hour to get seated, we were expecting good food, and in reality, everything was drenched in butter. Everything was super greasy, buttery. Even their hotcakes (which are like crepes - love crepes) they look great, but once you taste them, it's all butter. Our party also tried the French toast and hash browns and those were super greasy too and didn't taste good at all. The reason it's so busy is because it's the only show in town. There are a few of them and there's really nowhere else to go. It's sad. Being from NJ and having many diners that compete with each other, there are some good tasting Diners making good French toast, crepes and hash browns. This was just a joke and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT. The service on the other hand, was very good and workers were very nice and helpful.	0
Recommend by several senior student of mine in CMU, finally I came here today for my dear friends birthday. Food in here really amazing and served very fast. Associates in Pamela's also very kind and sweet. But they only receive cash no credit card such a pity.  Love this dinning experience and will come back very soon :D	1
We liked everything except the bacon. Another waiter recommended the ham for next time. If you like potatoes be sure to ask for extra crispy. The crepes were great come in a stack of three. I'd suggest getting one or two only. The fresh strawberry were great even though out of season. Definitely will eat here again.	1
Fantastic crepes. Really. The savory ones (like the smoked salmon), the sweet ones, all of them are just plain great. The restaurant is actually a tiny basement of a Shadyside-style home. They try hard to make it feel like France by making it narrow, crowded, lacking air conditioning, and cash-only. Those are the drawbacks, but it adds to the authenticity I suppose. Also, they have Evian and Orangina, which is always nice. If you need breakfast - can't beat the crepes here. Go, eat, have fun, forget where you are for a while.	1
I had a salmon crepe here & it was delicious - broke me out of the habit of mostly eating dessert crepes. The only downside is that they only take cash... but there is an ATM just down the street. This is a great place to meet up with an old friend or acquaintance.	1
I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often, and the owner who cooks the crepes recognizes my wife and me every single time we're there.\n\nThe crepes are excellent, the prices are more than reasonable, and as long as you don't go there during a peak period, it's never too crowded.	1
There are two locations, one just off Walnut Street in Shadyside and one on Craig Street in north Oakland.  The hours are quite limited, but I like the French neighborhood cafe vibe. \nThe crepes and coffee are really good, and they have a great selection of French tea.  The place is quite hectic, however.  As everyone said, wait in line to order, then get a table.  I have been in both locations many times, and it has never been a problem, though it does seem a bit weird at first. \n As for the service, it seems that their attitude is to give any rudeness you give them right back.  Be polite, and they will treat you accordingly.	1
The crepes here are good. They are tasty and they have a variety. \n\nHowever, the crepes are extremely over price. So over price that I cannot afford a drink.\n\nFinally, the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system. I've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff.	0
Fantastic savory and sweet crepes.  The light and very tasty crepes are served with a small salad topped with mandarin oranges and a champagne vinaigrette.  I have tried the salmon with creme fraiche, ham and cheese with their soytang sauce and plain butter with sugar.  \n\nThe place gets a bit crowded around noon and they have a pretty strict policy about ordering before you choose a seat.  Also, they only take cash (crepes run $7-9 plus $2 drinks).\n\nThey may have some mildly unpleasant/unpopular 'rules' but I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here and plan on returning.	1
"Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted \""help wanted\"" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe."	0
Well, to start, crepes aren't a Parisian concept.  They are solely a Brittany thing!  Therefore, the fact that this chain of restaurants carries a name like Crepes Parisiennes is pretentious.  That aside, the crepes are okay, nothing special.  I've had much lighter (crepes here were a bit heavier than they should be) and more authentic crepes elsewhere.  The other thing I do not like about this place are their hours. They are closed by 4pm and on Mondays, and stop serving savory crepes at 3pm???	0
"I love it here. It's so cute inside and so French. I honestly don't know how \""French\"" it actually is because I've never been to France, but from what I imagine France to be like, it's French. \n\nThe crepes, sweet or savory are delicious!! I think I prefer the sweet ones. Anything with nutella is so good. It's a good place to go for brunch with a friend. I can't wait to go when I get home again.\n\nThe wait staff is really friendly and you can watch them make crepes too! It's cool how they do it. I give props because I tried making crepes before.. and it's really hard to get it nice and thin.\n\nI like how the seating works too because you order and then sit down.. but sometimes there's not enough seats so that's an issue, but the staff knows that and won't make your food until you have somewhere to sit so it's not like you're standing around with food and nowhere to sit."	1
Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!	0
Truly one of my favorite breakfast spots in Pittsburgh.  The crepes are always cooked to perfection and the coffee is absolutely amazing.  Inconveniences include being cash only and being very, very tiny so getting a table might require some patience on a busy weekend morning...\n\n...but it is totally worth the wait.  The sweet crepes are my favorite, but I'm just a sucker for anything that involves fruit and nutella.	1
The two stars are for the food only. Otherwise, negative stars would  be in effect. WHO on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to? What a completely miserable experience. The bitchy emo service obviously leaves something to be desired, then again so does the ENTIRE restaurant! Sure, melted cheese in a crepe is good. Know what else is good? ANY melted cheese from any breakfast place and Not having to endure this hell hole. I am just upset that I went there in the early part of my day and am now in a foul mood as a result. I have been in Pittsburgh a few weeks and this place is without rival the worst brunch I've ever had (PA or CA) So, the one positive thing about it IS.... it has made me appreciate every other sub par brunch I've had up until this point.  Absolutely will never return. EVEN THE Orange juice was bad. Are you kidding?	0
I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant. The quality and consistency is excellent. The owner is the head chef, And will come to recognize you if you are a repeat customer. The ordering and seating routine is a little unusual. You stand in line and place an order and then get a number. Only then are you supposed to sit at a table. This does make sense since people cannot just sit at a table when there's a long line of people waiting to order. Just an FYI. The crapes are simple, but always good. I usually get the tomato and cheese and add an egg. The coffee is okay. I only wish they opened a little bit earlier.	1
Like the waiter and waitress there	1
I have been shopping at EB Pepper since it was in the Ross Park Mall (Well over 15 years ago!!) I have travelled to many cities, both in the US and abroad,  and I can honestly say that hands down this is my favorite boutique--no sloppy looks here, feminine, well-made, CHIC and gorgeous clothing--i even tried to shop here pregnant--If you need a cocktail dress or a rehearsal dinner dress OR an amazing suit..i just wish they would have a website...\nLove this place, always will!	1
I usually enjoy shopping at the Gap, but I recently had a really bad experience.  I went in to exchange a shirt and when I asked the orange face goblin manager if they had any more he was incredibly rude.  First, he wouldn't even look at me when I asked him a if there were any more of the shirt I wanted to exchange, and him immediately told me they did not have any of these.  Since I was in a hurry I just decided to return the shirt, then on my way out of the store I saw a whole table display of the shirt in several different colors.  The costumer service really ruined my experience.	0
The guy who works here gave me the best customer service and helped me pick out my new favorite jeans. Probably the best experience I have ever had at the Gap.	1
After a personal call and lengthy discussion on me wanting something unique and different and not a standard vase of flowers in our school colors of white and blue, I was asked if a unique container would be ok and I said that is what I wanted unique and different, from cheerleaders to the other cheer coach, for $100. When I saw that it was a vase of a few blue and white flowers, I was furious and feel ripped off!!! The order my family placed online was so awesome!! A puppy made of flowers in a ceramic pumpkin candy dish!! It was not even $60 including se day shipping!! The photos on his website have several larger arrangements made for $65-85!!! I sent several emails with photos comparing the two and have not received a reply back!! I will be calling!\nBUYERS BEWARE!!!! I guess he thought I would not see then!!	0
Used him a long time ago and to this day I still feel ripped off. Swore up and down to me he could do a job and came up short. very short. Then had the nerve to blame me.\n\nNow he has the nerve to stay open.\nHate this place!	0
Went here after dinner to grab a frosty but gave up after an extended wait. The cashiers were busy chatting with their friends and couldn't be bothered to help anyone in line. The location also seemed a bit sketchy; I'd avoid this one. Try Panera Bread across the street.	0
I will forever remember this drive-through conversation:\n\nWelcome to Wendy's. Can I take your order?\n\nYeah, I'd like a Frescuit. \n\nWe ain't got no hashbrowns!\n\n...um, all I want it a Frescuit. \n\nA'ight... I'm just lettin' you know.	0
In a pinch, Wendy's can do.  However, if you're in a hurry, and expect to use the drive-thru and get out, go elsewhere.  That is also a good sign, shows that the place has staying power with the constant line of people inside and outside wanting their food.  Bad thing, traffic can sometimes be snarled if there is that big of a line that it comes out onto Baum Blvd.\n\nQuick sidenote: if you decide to use the drive-thru, be sure to have used the bathroom prior, not fun to sit there waiting when you really need to use the facilities.  It's like that long ride on the turnpike when you already passed the last rest stop for 50 miles.	1
Just like every other Wendy's you've been to, except with slower service! Employees show no sense of urgency. There are two cash registers inside but I've never seen more than one being used at once, no matter how long the line is. Last time I was here, it took 30 minutes from the time I took my place in line until I received my order.	0
what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?	0
Don't use the drive-thru. I'm not sure why I keep coming here (probably because the food is decent enough and cheap). Every time I'm here, without fail, I can expect to wait no less than 13 minutes in the drive-thru.	0
I visisted this Wendy's often when I first started working nearby in Shadyside. But I quickly learned my lesson. I got tired of spending 20 minutes of my lunch break waiting in line. No less than 20 minutes. Every. Single. Time. The drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins. Plus, the staff is rude. I've driven out of my way a few times to the Wendy's in Wilkinsburg just to avoid this place.\n\nAnyway, I have no qualms with the food, as it's the same as any other Wendy's. So it's fine if you have time to kill.	0
Fast food.... NOT.\n\nBig corporate America places only get one shot w us. We came here cause we got stuff to do, quick trip to TARGET, try to get child fed quickly and to bed on time. SO LETS STOP AT Wendy's, right? Quick?\n\nSwing and miss. Never again.	0
"Even as a vegetarian, I felt REALLY silly ordering \""orange wheat gluten\"" or \""sesame soy protein\"". But their vegetarian menu is fantastic! I'm happy ordering veggies and tofu and Asian restaurants. But I really miss sesame chicken, and I can get it at China Palace! \n\nThe food itself is every so slightly above par. It's a little sweet, but not too oily. I can't vouch for their meat dishes, as the person I went with is also veg. They really manage to create satisfying, typical Chinese dishes, with meat substitutes that would fool most meat eaters.\n\nIt's definately expensive, we paid $40 for three entrees and a salad. And there's other Chinese food that's just as good for less money. But for vegetarians who miss \""typical\"" dishes, China Place is so the place to go!"	1
This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt, and I've gotta say, guys, I wasn't impressed.  This was also the first time in my life I've ordered from a Chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white.  Odd.  I suppose, then, I shouldn't have been surprised by the food.  My Moo Shu Chicken was mostly cabbage.  The pork dumplings were all dough, and the dough was very thick and unappealing.  To end on a good note, though, the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour, which you don't always find.	0
China Palace offers both Americanized Chinese Food and more authentic style dishes.  A good portion of their menu is populated by items such as General Tso's Chicken and Moo Shu Chicken, but there are also more authentic dishes such as Szechuan Water Boiled Beef (shui zhu nio) and Yu xiang Eggplant.  Personally I have to say the Water Boiled Beef is both the best Water Boiled Beef I've had in Pittsburgh and also the best dish I've had at China Palace, I like all my spicy dishes with extra spicy.  Their Americanized offerings are also cooked pretty well, definitely better than take out restaurants.\n\nContrary to popular belief, China Palace actually has a Taiwanese owner and not an American owner.\n\nChina Palace is nice as you can go there with people with more Americanized palates if you have a more Asian palate, or vice versa, and you can please everyone.\n\nPrices run from around 9 dollars to upper teens for some of the chef's specials.\n\nHighly Recommended.	1
"The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat \""chicken\"" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.\n\nI was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.\n\nThe service was friendly enough, though. \n\nNot to be recommended unless you're desperate."	0
Ordered Peking duck for delivery at 5:30 yesterday.  I was told it would take 45 minutes, but the food did not arrive until after 7:00.  I had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot.  The duck itself was not that great; the skin (usually the best part of the duck) was soggy instead of crispy and the meat lacked flavor.  If anyone knows a place in Pittsburgh that serves good Peking duck, please message me.	0
We used to visit this place most every time we went to Pittsburgh.   The menu has change and so has the food  I ordered off the lunch lunch special and the Kung Pao Chicken was average at best and the egg roll was horrible.  My friends has water chestnuts with black spots in their dishes.  We shall not be going back there.	0
The portions are huge. Reasonable price. The fish I ordered was decent.	1
General tso's chicken... was bad... just bad... too soy saucy... it needs more tanginess... It didn't taste the way that it should be... \n\nI am never going to order their General tso ever again. Never ever whatsoever!	0
This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. Great location, great veggie options. Every meal I have eaten there has been tasty.  Only 2 things that bother me, the hot and sour soup is TOO hot. I can't eat it. And it's not easy to find a parking space. Lots of driving around to find a spot. \nBut the restaurant is definitely worth checking out.	1
This place can pass as average if you order the right thing.  I have taken out from here about a dozen times in the past year mainly because it is so convenient to my place but after trying their sweet and sour chicken this last time I will probably stay away for now (soggy/slimy, not very appetizing or tasty).  Entrees like chicken with any kind of veggies/mushrooms are okay.  Price is not bad.  Why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh?	0
Was there at a busy time -- Mother's Day dinner -- and the service was poor, with a waitress who did not ask specifics and was slow to deliver things like hot mustard and kept us waiting for our order for over an hour.  Not all her fault.  And, the food was ordinary.  Not bad, a little tasteless, but why bother?	0
What has happened to this place? Used to be delicious, but something's changed! Rude host...pointed us to a table (of course the personal cell phone BS going on with a friend was far more important) for a noon lunch, in a nearly empty restaurant. Nor good signs and we should have walked out then. We started with a bland egg roll. Moved on to fair won ton soup. Entrees of cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken, both on brown rice we're disappointing. Left us both wishing that we had gone for Thai food down the street instead! Save yourself and opt for one of the other fabulous dining experiences in Shadyside!	0
The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better.	0
In sum, we ordered take out here a few days ago. There were bugs in my egg drop soup. Nuff said.\n\n\nUsually, I write these long reviews. Not today. I ordered two orders of soup Hot and Sour and Egg Drop. I only eat the Hot and Sour the night we ordered our take out. I specifically ordered the Egg Drop to have for lunch yesterday. Fortunately for me- I noticed the bugs prior to eating. Looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup. Disgusting.	0
"My favorite chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clean, flavorful, close in proximity, priced right, friendly service, food comes out quickly, and they're probably the only ones open til 10pm! (since Pittsburgh is the \""city that sleeps\""). The only dish I don't like and got confused with is their Walnut Shrimp. In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, but in this restaurant, its salty and does not have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore. And I wish they delivered to the downtown area."	1
Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery, and the wontons were inedible. I ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and I surmised that they didn't think I would notice. Also I think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visit;the place is dirty.	0
Not very good Chinese food here. It reminded me of a cheap college place. They give you plenty of food but it is low quality. Could have probably went to another place and paid half the price for the same meal.	0
"I have never, ever thrown food away, but I couldn't stomach this stuff. I got the pork fried rice and egg drop soup. Holy moly was that a poor decision. The rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy \""pork\"". It tasted nothing like pork, or meat for that matter. I tried adding soy sauce for some kind of flavor but dear lord that didn't help. The soup was a weird creamy mess. My friend got the general tso chicken, which should generally be a safe choice. WRONG. cardboard. Cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster. Seriously we've never been so grossed out that we had to throw out $20 worth of food but that's what happened."	0
Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service	0
Not really for females under 45.	0
This store is shameful to the Shadyside family. Upon entering the shop, the blond sales associate judged my friend and I by staring at us and abruptly walking away without a greeting. My friend was given dirty looks form the elderly sales associate while I tried to ignore the rudeness and enjoy the clothing. I am not complaining about the prices, I have bought many items from the same designers and enjoy the designers quality, I was not sticker shocked. What I am upset about is the customer service by these women who think it is okay to treat potential customers with such disrespect. Neither me friend nor I were dressed poorly, we are both fashion stylist in the Pittsburgh area. I have never been so disrespected in my life and after writing this review I will be contacting the owner.	0
So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered?	0
Eddy was recommended to me by a friend since I have curly hair. Pretty much my entire life I'd never done anything with my hair except trim it (cut-wise, I dyed it for a long time), but I decided it was time for a change. I decided to go with a dramatic look and I was very nervous (not sure how well I hid it) but Eddy was super nice and I calmed down quickly after we started chatting. And WOW, he did an absolutely fantastic job! He cut it perfectly to enhance my curls and did everything exactly as I asked (I've had trouble before with stylists ignoring my instructions about cutting my bangs or being too timid about cutting off damage). This is, without a doubt, the best haircut I've ever had. (Though that may change since I'm planning to go back to him later to try more styles!) I wanted a cut that was both feminine and fierce and he nailed it.  \n\nI highly recommend Eddy for anyone with curly hair! I also greatly appreciated the student discount.	1
Best Salon in Pittsburgh! I've been going to Eddy for a few years now and he never fails to make my hair look a thousand times better than it does when walking in the door. I have super thick, curly hair and he makes cutting and styling it look effortless. Super talented stylist who is always great fun to talk to! \n\nEveryone at Salon Cercone are really nice, and the environment is welcoming and casual. It's definitely a great place for the more laid back salon goers.	1
I've been going to Eddy for years. In fact I am his first paying client. I have followed him from different salons and was so happy when he landed at Salon Cercone. I believe he's been there 8 years or so now. It's a perfect fit for him as a stylist and me as a client.\nEddy is a true artist in his craft. I have had every colour, cut and style and then some. Anything Eddy or I could think up over the years, I've worn it. Over twenty years later and I still get compliments from complete strangers on my look. I owe it all to Eddy!\nThe atmosphere is upscale but not stuffy. The staff are a knowledgeable group of extremely talented hair, skin and nail artists. There are many salons to choose from but not many that offer excellence. Salon Cercone is a true Shadyside gem.	1
The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it.	0
2 woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable. I haven't received my piece yet and its been about 5 days. Iffy about who owns the place but, ill see what the end product will be once I was receive it. If it approves I will change my rating	0
I didn't find the food all that flavorable, the service isn't great, and it's definitely not worth the price.	0
I've had pretty good experiences dining here, but maybe that's because other people were paying for my food about half of those times.  The service was fine, and I liked the decor.  I also enjoyed the food, although if I recall correctly, there was entirely too much of it.\n\nAs a carless resident of Pittsburgh, I love the great location on Walnut Street.  I don't have to go out of my way to dine here, since there are plenty of stores to visit.	1
Food, blah.  Pierogi with chipotle butter app was terrible- frozen Mrs. T's pierogi in PITTSBURGH is just lazy, and they were drowning in greasy, room temp aforementioned butter which carried heat with absolutely no flavor.  Everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality. Main courses were a cuban sandwich and something I don't recall (bad sign) and were extremely disappointing.\n\nService, argh.  It was late, but if you're open you're open, right?  Slow, inattentive, wrong sides (which we couldn't correct given the service) an they basically vacuumed around our feet.	0
We had Sunday brunch upstairs and I was very pleased with the quality and quantity of the dishes and the service. Lots better than most.	1
Too pricey for the quality.	0
Just got back from a lunch at the Walnut Grill. I had been there once before about 3 years ago. I don't remember much other than it was a solid meal and the mushroom soup I got was good.\n\nAnyway, it was fairly empty for lunch. Perhaps it's because it has a darker atmosphere (today was gorgeous out) than other SS places. I had the lunch special which was a Cajun chicken sandwich with mozzarella, basil and roasted red peppers (9$). GF got the veggie sandwich which has portabellos, spinach, feta and onions (9$).\n\nMy sandwich was great. The chicken was nicely cooked (not dry). The mozzarella was nice and big. The basil was a nice touch and fresh. The roasted red peppers were from a can, but were good. Served on warm ciabatta. Sandwich wasn't overly salty either. The fries were surprisingly good.\n\nGF's veggie sandwich was equally good. I usually don't like spinach, but the bite I had was nice and feta/mushroom-y. She ate all of it (which rarely happens).\n\nI also got a Proper draft which is an English Pale Ale. It was quite good. Nice and malty with minimal hops.	1
While it has a somewhat trendy looking menu, don't be fooled. We ordered the calamari, mexican pizza, ahi tuna, and french onion soup. While the onion soup was actually good, the rest was awful.\n\nThe mexican pizza was greasy, and looks like it was reheated in a microwave, it tasted like cardboard, and looked even worse. The calamari was awful, came with a gross looking/tasting dip. The ahi tuna was actually just mediocre, which was a nice improvement from the rest of the meal. \n\nIf i was a bigger jerk I would have demanded they take the food back, but I just had a bite of everything and asked the waitress to take it back.\n\nI would never eat here again	0
Want good bloody mary's to kick off your Saturday or Sunday morning? Come to Walnut Grill. They throw a jumbo shrimp in it which is awesome. The eggs benedict is terrific!	1
This place has cockroaches.\nPeople throw up in the booths.\nPretty good white russian.\n\n(b)	0
"Not too shabby.  I would call it a \""finer diner\"" in terms of the definition of a Diner.  The menu has your everyday American items; nothing too creative or imaginative.   It's pretty basic.  Salads, sandwiches, burgers and entrees we have all had before.\nThe food is good though; however you're paying for the location and decor (which, in our opinion, was kind of out-dated).  We started with the mushroom flatbread that was a bit on the sweet side; however it was loaded with mushrooms which is a huge plus.\nI had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and Jordan had the reuben.  The salmon was very light and tasty and Jordan's corned beef was sliced real thick.  French fries are pretty standard.\nAll in all, I guess this is where the rich people of ShadySide get their diner food: same kind of food, just a fancier ambiance than Denny's.  \nWe will be back when we want something comforting but dont want to be surrounded by teenagers and want something better than Eat 'N Park."	0
"The staff is super friendly every time I'm in this store. I think I've been there almost every month since there's always something there that I'd love to have and it's right down the street.  Whether it's random cooks tools like a 4\"" wide vegetable peeler (highly recommended), a Microplane grater or splurging on a new Shun knife, Williams-Sonoma always seems to have what I want with people there who know what they're talking about."	1
"Generally speaking, I am a huge fan of Williams-Sonoma. In CA, I love their store in Union Square. The service in this store is ridiculous. The ladies seemed to be complaining about something the whole time we were there and seemed to have an attitude as if we were intruding into their space.\nThe real kicker for me, though, was that they advertise for free gift wrapping but don't seem to really offer it. The first time I came in, my boyfriend spent around $50 on a gift for a friend. We were excited about the gift wrapping but then they said they don't offer gift wrapping after 5 pm. Seriously? Why not? They weren't busy or anything at that moment. Why couldn't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us?\nThe second time (and the last time) I came in they just said \""no, we don't wrap\"". I was so confused and annoyed that I just left after paying. I haven't written a review in over a year but their horrible service motivated me to say something.\nBeware of these ladies. They just aren't nice."	0
Great store!\n\nOne of the previous reviewers seems to have had some bad experiences with service in the store; my experience thankfully hasn't been the same. I've always had helpful, friendly people working whenever I've popped in to get something for our kitchen.\n\nGreat selection of items, and the staff always have great recommendations for me when I'm not quite sure of what I need. Their sales could be a bit better, but that's not necessarily the store's fault, and it's never really worth the longer trip to the South Side to hit their main competitor's store.\n\nParking can be a bit annoying if you try to get a spot on the street, but the garage around the corner is convenient and is reasonably priced. Gotta love Walnut Street!	1
My hubby and I wandered around Shadyside on Saturday afternoon and made Williams-Sonoma one of our stops. It was warm (but not too warm) and sunny (but not too bright), and Williams-Sonoma's doors were thrown open, welcoming customers into a land of expensive kitchen gadgets and extravagant kitchen accessories. The scent of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies wafted from a high-end easy-bake-oven type device set up near the entrance. Needless to say, the store was packed. This really is the perfect Williams-Sonoma location.\n\nMy complaint with Williams-Sonoma lies not with this store but with the entire company. The hubby and I have an adequate amount of discretionary income, yet browsing here makes me feel like I live below the poverty line. I just really prefer shopping at Williams-Sonoma's competitors of Crate & Barrel and Sur La Table that have a better balance of low, moderate, and high priced items.	1
"BEWARE!! This car wash damaged my 2008 Yukon Denali . Spoke with one of the owners, Justin, and he refused to work with me to get the damaged piece repainted. Do not believe that the \""We Are Responsible\"" sign out in front means anything. The brushes are very rough on the vehicle. If you have a dark colored vehicle i would not use this car wash, go to a touchless."	0
Remember that saying, that sex is like pizza - even when it's so-so, it's good? That pretty much sums it up. There's nothing appallingly wrong with the Pizza Co. pizza. It's just kind of ho-hum. \n\nWith that said, I enjoyed the chili poppers a lot. (Which were inexplicably wrapped with the ranch sauce for delivery. Mmmmm....hot, sweaty ranch dressing.)\n\nThe delivery guy was really friendly. Delivery time was unimpressive. A full 45 minutes mid-afternoon, and I live two blocks away? That's what I get for being lazy, probably. Karmic pizza. \n\nPrices are pretty good though, so that's a bonus. They may end up being my 'Dangit, I've only got fifteen bucks!' joint. Otherwise, probably not.	0
I wasn't crazy about the Untouchable since I don't like Primanti's sandwiches, but the pizza was more than decent. Unfortunately, they don't deliver to us, so we had to go there to get it.	1
New location in Rostraver! Great wings! Take out wings are usually soggy or\nOver cooked...not these! Cajun and buffalo are Amazing!	1
Old-times feel, but they have awesome hoagies, great pizza, and very good italian food.\n\nThey do deliver, and pretty much anything on the menu is able to be ordered for delivery.  The drinks are by the can or by the 2-liter.\n\nIn-store, you place the order and they'll either hand it to you at the counter or bring it out to you.  There is very limited seating.\n\nYou can call in your order and pick it up, too.\n\nDefinitely would recommend.	1
Nice people, and they never screw up my tailoring. Whenever I ask for an item to be done at a certain time they will get it done. Then I tell them I don't need it that fast and wait at least two weeks before picking it up. I wish the Taco Bell was still close by.	1
The good: The ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful. Also, if you live in the area, it's certainly convenient. The alterations are well done. \n\nThe bad: Their alterations manager won't give you an estimate for the work before he does it. Not even a ballpark. So basically, you drop your clothes off, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. Expect the work (even something simple like hemming) to take more than a week, and cost a fair amount. \n\nIn summary: Good work, friendly but slow service, expensive. If it weren't so convenient I doubt I'd go back.	0
If you want to be completely ignored when you walk into a business, then this is the place for you. I walked into this bakery at 4:40PM. There were 2 customers ahead of me and 2 ladies behind the counter. One was waiting on the customers while the other\nseemed to be more interested in getting the place ready for closing at 5:00PM and\nsocializing with someone who walked in after me and was obviously just visiting the lady. The other lady finished with her customer and then walked back to the back of the store and they both completely ignored me for a good 5 minutes while I was waiting by the cake case too buy a cake. Ten minutes later I finally asked them exactly how much longer they were going to ignore me and walked out. I them came back to ask for the owner's name and was told it was Ron. Well Ron, this incident cost you $17.99 which I was going to spend on a Tiramasu cake and also lost you a good customer. I also plan to tell my family and friends NOT to shop here. TERRIBLE SERVICE.	0
Extremely rude lady works there on Sundays.  Called at 1:50 p.m.and wanted to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday.  I was told that they had cakes available but to hurry because they close at 2:00 p.m. sharp.  I arrived at 1:58 p.m. and the rude lady would not let me in.  She kept pointing to the clock.  Pool customer service.  I will NEVER go back.	0
Definitely a Chinese gem in the South Hills!  Family owned and operated.  It's a husband (chef) and wife (waitress) team that owns/runs the place and my family and I have been coming here for years.  \n\nThe food has always been good and fresh.  I always get a bowl of their rice soup and it always hits the spot.  I know that's it's probably a very simple dish to make, but that's definitely my go-to appetizer at this place.  Also the egg roll isn't greasy but always crispy and fresh so I highly recommend.\n\nWe usually order the chicken with garlic sauce and a beef dish and haven't been disappointed.  When it gets crowded, service can be slower but be patient since it's only the husband and wife team that are holding down the fort.  \n\nI feel like it's one of those places that people go to for years and get to know the owners and the owners get to know you, so definitely worth 5 stars in my opinion.	1
Great family run restaurant . I have been going here for 20 years . the food is great and the owner who is the only waitress treats you like family .	1
A typical tavern with a basic bar menu of burgers, sandwiches, and fried munchies. The deep fried jalapeno pretzel is a great change from the usual fries, or cheese sticks. I usually order the fried fish sandwich, which is a great size, and filling. Service is okay, casual, and prompt. The main dining area away from the bar, is nice, and quiet, full of Pittsburgh sports memorabilia. Not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order. Love their witty signs they put up to get you thinking as you drive down Rt. 88 which seems to be a never ending construction zone.	0
Ordered chicken wings. They looked very unappetizing, especially after I picked one up and it had feathers coming out of it. I understand things happen, but the situation was handled very unprofessionally. I'm not sure if our server was embarrassed, but it seemed as though we were avoided after the issue was brought to her attention.	0
Blech! Darren's often too nice in his reviews. The pizza was really greasy, and the bacon was minimal. It's just a little shack of a joint on a desolate street where you'd think you might meet Freddie Kruger after dark! But Darren was dying to go here just so he could review it, and it sucked, didn't it sweetie? ;) They didn't even deliver to us. I had to drive him there just to get it, and you can't eat in either. Cash only. Avoid.\n\nWe could have ordered from Slice, which I like and is in our hood, but noooo...\n\n:D	0
Worst nail salon ever. \n\nI made the mistake of buying a Groupon for a mani/pedi here without really doing any research. Not a smart move on my part. The place was totally dusty and there was no AC. Being that it was like 90 degrees that day, it was hotter inside than outside. The manicurist, who was very chatty and nice enough for one star, didn't put any lotion on my hands, or clean my nails at all-- just quickly filed them and slopped on the polish. The top coat gathered in some parts and made it look thick and chunky- completely uneven. \n\nWhen I stuck my hand in the dryer, I accidently bumped and smudged a nail.....and her remedy (wait for it...) was to LICK HER FINGER AND BLOT HER SALIVA OVER THE POLISH. I just kinda stared at her in shock, unable to speak. \n\nMaybe folks in Castle Shannon are into this kind of vibe, but I will continue to stay within city limits the next time I feel like endulging. It was just a bad scene.	0
I would absolutely not return to this salon. My nail tech was nice enough, very chatty and personable. But the other techs there were very catty talking about everyone and their neighbor. The parrafin dip felt nice but the wax contraption was on the floor and very uncomfortable getting in and out of. Now on to the manicure. My natural nails were very long and I asked for a short/square shape. I got a strange mixture of short, semi short, square and round. The polish application was absolutely terrible, uneven and up to and over the cuticle with no clean up. I've never seen such a mess and can actually do a better job myself. This made me question whether or not she was professionally trained. I should have questioned her but at this point I just wanted to get out of there. I went home, removed the polish and reapplied myself. What a complete waste.	0
They do an okay job, but I find this place is VERY expensive and while they do an ok job, they don't do a great job.  You can find the same or better manicure near by, for half the price.	0
Signature Desserts is the ONLY bakery I will go to. Not only are they reasonable priced, their desserts are out of this world and their work is fantastic.\n\nI used them for my wedding cake and dessert table. Let me tell you, beyond impressed. I ordered a three tiered cake with an intricate design, 5 addtional 8 inch cakes for the dessert table, and 8 dozen cookies. All of this, including delivery and multiple consultations was under $500!!!!! I was so happy with my dessert table, everything turned out absolutely beautiful, like out of a wedding catalog!!!\n\nLinda and her husband are such wonderful, warm people and they made this experience so wonderful and stress free for me!!! \n\nI would reccomend them for every bakery need you have!!!!	1
Meh. This is not my kind of place. The food always seems oily or greasy and doesn't taste that good. Plus they have yellow fried rice. That is a big NO NO for me. It is kind of like mushed cardboard. I don't like it at all. I haven't eaten here in a while and i don't think i will start anytime soon.	0
It's Calabria's - what more can you say. Great good, reasonable prices, and a nice, relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThis location and the Upper St. Clair location are both winners. Everything is homemade. The restaurants are super clean, the menu has a nice variety, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.	1
If you like waterlogged pasta, runny sauce and food that really is not that good, by all means eat here.  \n\nWater is cold, so that's a plus.	0
Horrible experience. The food itself was good but way over priced for what it was.  They charged us for every little thing.. extra sides of dressing after they brought the wrong kind to begin with, a side of vinegar, surprised they didn't charge us for the extra napkins. Service was terrible to boot. Never will go back. You'd have better service and food at Olive Garden...and that's hard for me to say.	0
Sad little place, even by Pittsburgh standards. Ambience of a funeral parlor, with average age of patrons about 69. Exemplary Calabria's dish? Oriental chicken salad garnished with uncooked ramen noodles.	0
Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although, when you go inside, it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here, which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day, which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself, but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good, the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there.	0
Very unhappy with the sales people did not do what they said they would do service department is very good	0
Being new to the area, I get recommendations from a couple of guys I work with who were born and raised in Baldwin, on the best places to eat, shop, etc.  \n\nI was informed yesterday that Danny's has the best Italian hoagies around.  So I HAD to try one for dinner.  It has the perfect amount of meat seasoning and topping.  The onions were a little heavy for me, but being my first time, I took it as it came.  The bread is perfectly toasted on the outside, and soft on the inside.  In all, I was given good information by my coworkers.  I would rank it in my top 3 of Italian hoagies.  Darren W's. review on the pizza sounds great too.....looking forward to trying it.	1
I'm from eastern PA and NJ...I wanted a simple Meatball Parmigiana sub. for dinner. Apparently Danny doesn't understand what this is or..doesn't know how to make one. I was told they have a meatball sub or a chicken parmigiana sub...but not a meatball parmigiana sub.  Are you kidding me?  How hard is it to split a sub roll down the middle, add 6-8 meatballs (depends on size), red sauce/gravy cover with mozzarella cheese and throw in the oven till the cheese is melted...Danny if you read this you owe me for this recipe!!  Give me a break. I left without my sub and got one from Italian Village Pizza just down the street. Dude this is not rocket science...	0
Best Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better part of my life (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. Honest to god, I live in CO and this is always one of the reasons I return to visit the town I grew up in. Just get an Italian hoagie here and quit trying to --you can forget the meatball sub guy. Pizza is quite good, too. But get the hoagie.	1
I really wanted to like this place. I really did. I had originally started coming here because I bought a groupon and was looking for a new stylist.\n\nMy total experience here includes 3 haircuts, eye brow wax, and a full head of highlights. The highlights were the icing on the cake and definitely are what made me not want to go back for good.\n\nMy stylist was a very personable woman, but in the end she wasn't very good on listening to what I wanted. 3 seperate times I did not get what I asked for.\n\nThe absolute worst part about this place though is that every single time I've been here I've been rushed in and out and felt very unappreciated. Whoever is running the books and appointments there really needs to get their act together. If you can't handle high traffic then do not OVER BOOK yourselves. I've schedueled all of my appointments well in advance, so it's not like they were squeezing me in.\n\nAtmosphere is also stuffy and unwelcoming. \n\nI decided to give it 2 stars since my stylist was a very nice lady.	0
"I set up my appointment a week in advance.  I was told it was not an issue to get it done in one day.  When I showed up at the scheduled time, I was told \""oh was that today?\""  Late in the day I called to see if I could pick up my car and it wasn't done and was told it would not be done until the next day.  When I went to pick it up the following day I asked what happened.  The guy,(George) who had mishandled my experience from the beginning, proceeded to blame me saying that there was no way that job could be done in one day.  If you'd like to be blamed for their shortcomings, you should take your vehicle here."	0
I had both of my card spray painted and they worked with my insurance to fix both cars with no cost to me. It took a little longer than I would've liked but they did good work.	1
The lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude. Will not use this garage in the future.	0
I personally believe that this is one of the nicer GE in the area. For some reason the inner-city ones seem dark and dingy. Also, I was at the Waterworks last month and they are renovating this to make it a Market District. If you don't know, now you know ;)	1
I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so, but within the last few years, it has gone severely downhill. The food is greasy, way too expensive, and they use massive amounts of MSG. I got terrible MSG poisoning from Tai Pei and ever since then, have gone to Jimmy Wan's down the road.	0
Consistently excellent.  I enjoy their sushi and know when I get a chicken dish I don't have to guess if it is eatable always good white meat.   I typically do take out and it is well worth the drive	1
We visited with a Groupon last Thursday. \n\nWe ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup, the black bean chicken, szechuan beef, and lamb with scallions. \n\nThe soup was awesome! Very spicy!\n\nThe rest of the food was awful. It was tasteless... the meat had a weird fluffy texture.... there was zero flavor. It was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager. \n\nHe said the kitchen would make new dishes. \n\nThey brought three new entrees. They were again completely flavorless, but warmer. I couldn't taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat. It was awful. \n\nWe paid and left. \n\nyuck. \n\nI used to go here as a child. I remember the sushi was always good. Maybe that is the thing to order!	0
"I pass this all of the time but finally decided to stop.  The restaurant is incredibly clean and it was great service, but I felt like the food was just \""okay.\""  Nothing to brag/boast about.  Prices are fair.  Maybe so many groupons because not enough people are raving about it?"	0
Excellent Chinese food.   Every time we have ordered take out from here, it's been great.  Egg Rolls, General Tso's, Happy Family, Triple Delight, dumplings...all taste delicious.	1
I have only had takeout from Tai Pei, but the chicken lo mein was delicious and the general tso's was the best I have ever had! It was sweet, but still had a kick to it. Nothing was over priced and we weren't waiting forever for delivery. Will definitely visit the restaurant in the future!	1
The food here is very good. I've frequented the restaurant many times for sushi, noodles, rice, and plenty of their other dishes. The atmosphere is also great and the service is very friendly. I would definitely recommend Taipei if you're craving Chinese and sushi.	1
Food was very bland, i even asked that they kick it up a notch.  I traveled to this area from Northern Virginia.  I never had such bland Chinese food in all my travels.  I have had worse, the Scallops and Shrimp were fresh, the rice was cooked well.  Went here after my Brothers raved about it...	0
I ordered from this place and the staff was INCREDIBLY rude when they delivered my order. The woman not only rang my doorbell 5 times but she BANGED, and I mean BANGED, on our window of our house without even a second of wait in between. When I opened the door the woman threw my food at me and told me never to order again as she called me TWICE with no answer (my fianc\u00e9 was upstairs sleeping with his phone, but our home is clearly marked and we've never had problems before). I handed her the money and told her I wasn't giving her a tip then and she LOST IT. I closed the door and she walked away. What in the actual heck? You guys lost a customer forever and I'll never recommend you to anyone. That was insanely rude.	0
We have a new puppy...  Chocolate lab.  So far he's had Parvo, giardia, worms, and probably stuff we don't even know!  He is very healthy now.  VCA was very accommodating, saw us quickly, and even helped us out a few times without charging (quick consults).  We highly recommend VCA	1
Truly, the kindest, most gentle vets I have ever met! We recently moved to Pittsburgh, and one of my cats was dealing with an ongoing sickness. We went to VCA Fox Chapel, and I was pleasantly surprised by how kind, caring, and gentle the doctors were. We worked with Dr. Miggins and Dr. Resek. In the end, we ended up having to put our cat to sleep. Even then, Dr. Resek was amazingly patient and kind, and gave us the time and space we needed. Yes, they are expensive. But you are getting great care and more than that, you can rest assured that they truly have your pets' best interest in mind.	1
Good prices, better coffee.  The food never looks good so I haven't tried it.\n\nI sometimes stop here for coffee before work, the baristas are always friendly--even at 6:02 am, right after opening. If you're in the area I recommend it over the Starbuckses (what is the plural of that?!) in Giant Eagle or B&N in the waterworks mall.	1
Good coffee - I'll give them that. But beware when using your debit card here. I don't know if it's their software or employee error, but on two separate occasions I was charged twice for the same cup of coffee and pastry here. Both times I went in, and they promptly rectified it - but kind of annoying, no?	0
Love their coffee.\nThey need to add help in the morning.\nWith all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.\nI'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.\nUsually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel\nThey should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business.	0
Excellent espresso, with quick service.  Priced right too.  Parking can be a little tricky but worth the stop.	1
I have purchased many high end pieces of luggage (Tumi, Briggs & Riley) from this location with the understanding that they are adding value to my purchase over that of online or airport retailers should I need a repair as they are certainly not less expensive.  Well One of my B&R bags is in need of repair.  The bag was purchased Dec-2012 so it is not that old and it is indeed covered under the lifetime repair of B&R.   I stopped in today to see what could be done.  They could not repair the bag and did offer to send the bag back to B&R for me for the small fee of $35+tax. Really, I could walk down the road a bit and have the UPS store ship it for half that price.  What value are they providing me?   It is a shame that the brick and mortar stores are unable to provide value over online and this is one easy way to do it.  A Shame since I used to be a really good customer.	0
I tend to prefer this location of Thai Place because it is always so quiet.  The menu seems to be identical to that of the Walnut Street location.  \n\nAll of the curry dishes are good here, as are some of the simpler dishes.  I especially like the Penang curry, and the sauce for the chicken with garlic is excellent.  They also include a lot of really good, fresh vegetables in all of their dishes, which, to me, is a plus.  While I haven't tried many of them, the chef's specials seem to be very original to the restaurant. \n\nThe service is always prompt and excellent.  The only drawback to that I can think of is that the prices are a bit high, compared to other Thai restaurants.  However, I always leave Thai Place feeling pleased and satisfied.	1
Great place for weekday lunch.  Best Pad Thai around.	1
Ok food...nothing great...many better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh!	0
First and far most people , I never write a bad review.  So imagine what an average experience I had. Actually, this isn't even a bad review. OMG but the food was just so average.I've been to better Thai restaurants in the past. The pad thai was not good and that's what it should be!! The curries were very rich with vegetables but again weren't delicious. I have nothing against this place, but if you have had really good thai food in other places, then you have raised the bar and won't like this place. So if you're trying Thai food for the first time...don't hit this place. Sorry for being honest, but look, I'm really obsessed with Thai food and have tried most of the thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this restaurant is not going on my favorite list. I don't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall. Just not going back there. Who cares what I think though, everyone has a different taste. So you might like it, just not me:-/	0
This was one of the best music stores that I've visited in Pittsburgh. Though not the best in Pennsylvania it had a pretty good variety of instruments and the prices weren't insane either! They had a used section that was full of guitars, amps, keyboards, and other instruments to tickle your fancy. I was particularly interested in the keyboards and ukuleles and was very pleased! \n\nIf you're a guitar fanatic you'll definitely love it here. The service was very helpful and really friendly as well.	1
Best place in town for all your keys/synths needs. Ask for Tony or anyone really , everyone is very helpful	1
The sale/price/trade all went smoothly.  The salesman proundly presented a clean carfax.  The car has been good except:\n1.  a google search of the vin revealed that the front bumper, front  fender, doors, and rear fender had all been replaced at the auction house (manheim) apparently to escape Carfax. All of this was on the sales slip from Manheim.  The sales guy had to know, although he claimed the buyer never told him.   Slick. \n2.  after a flat tire, it was discovered the spare was missing.  after maybe 10 phone calls, and another 10 emails, several visits, and a month, a new wheel (non matching) and tire were provided. \n3.  Several serious car people have told me that they are known for scratch and dent cars, hence the on-site body shop.  \n\nThose the facts in the case, as I know them.	0
Best cigar selection in Pittsburgh. Their pipe tobacco blends are fantastic, I recommend RLP-6. Great atmosphere!	1
"We went to this place also after seeing it on D,D,and D.\nThis was after the smoking in places that serve food was put in place. We went with my sister and her not even toddler my two children and ... well we get to the location and almost turned around \""its just a bar\"" Defiantly a dive! Took a while to get our food. The bar was loud and smokey! I orderd the perogies since that is why we went there. My son ordered a fish sandwich we orderd a childs spaggetti. some wings and some other things. The fish sandwich was HUGE. biggest i had ever seen.  \n\nThe childs spaggetti was big and was shared with two children My son loved it .. i tasted it because i couldnt belive him. It was good! \n\nTHE PEROIGES ----- BLAND~, soggy, not crisp not buttery ... they were greasy. it tasted like bland mashed potatoes between unseasoned dough. \n\nWe drove well over an hour to eat here. BIG mistake."	0
The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it. I've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables. 98% of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer. But damn the perogies are good.	0
Man this place is a dump. If you're not a local or regular good luck feeling comfortable there. It is obviously a local bar first and restaurant second. Certainly not for the ladies or kids. The pierogies were indeed delish and the fish sammo was okay. It was cooked nicely but the fish wasn't all that fresh and you could tell. Btw, I did not pre-order pierogies and I got mine no problem. But it wasn't during peak hours. \n\nAs noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender. A bit gruff, but I've had worse. Music was BLASTING non-stop during my hour there. A Nickelback fan's dream com true. Smoky, but not horribly so. \n\nIf you're a local rummy barfly then this place is for you! But if you're a DDD fan you might want to move on to another DDD spot in Pittsburgh. Not sure why it would be featured on the show. Nadine's was better and they made you feel welcome.	0
"They have 4 gourmet cheese sticks with marinara sauce for $7.95. No, I lied, they're not gourmet, they're the frozen kind and they're awful, why would they charge so much for them?\nHowever, this place is fantastic! Lots of Christmas decorations everywhere, and I mean everywhere! They also have karaoke at 8:30, the crowd is older (your parent's age), they dance and sing along; it's a great time. They get packed so expect to stand around, the place is small but no one cares and they will hang out for a while, it's hard to get a table at this smoky \""garage\"". If you don't smoke, you can hang out at the add on but it's not as fun as the bar area. This is the place to have a good time!"	1
As a non-smoker, it takes me a while to get used to the stink. As a karaoke lover, oh yea, it's the best place in the city! I would just come for great karaoke (my husband DJs every Thursday!) and a nice atmosphere.	1
love love love the steaks they make!!! there are times when I beg my husband to take me to applebee's because I want their stake; I eat stakes everywhere, even the Japanese Steak Houses where they only make steaks weren't like Applebee's :)\n\nthe only No at this place was, I oredered pine apple juice and it was so old that it smelled and tasted and kind of even looked like Mold;\n\nbut other than that I love theirr Stakes :)	1
I was there for couple of drinks with my friend who was stay a night at the hotel. \nIt was the worst experience i have ever had in a bar in Pittsburgh. When i got there my friend was having dinner at the table and i joined we. I was there only for drinks so i asked the server if i could have a drink but she suggested re restaurant is closed so i will have to get a drink at the bar area. Shortly after that i see her serving other ppl around me in the dinning area and when i asked her about it she told me it was last call and they were also having a drink so it was ok. Honesty it was a weird experience and i wish i could complain to somebody about it being it's such a big chain of hotels. I asked the server If I could talk to the restaurant manager she said sure but the manager never showed up.	0
Big hotel. Not bad. Bathrooms way too small I had to dry off outside the bathroom. Priceline for good rate.	0
Stayed here overnight and wished we realized how busy of a hotel this place was before checking in. We stayed over a weekend in the summer and upon check in, the lobby was packed with 2 large confereces going on. Not enough parking to accomadate the lounge crowd on Saturday night and hotel guests. We returned back to the hotel after dinner and couldn't find a parking place. Also, next time I am offered a room with a sleep number bed, I will definately pass.	0
Nice to find a dead fly on the bed after checking in! Nicely done.	0
My boyfriend enjoys brewing his own beer and the guys here are wonderful. They always have the supplies and if they don't they can recommend places to get them! Everyone is always very nice and knowledgeable!	1
Alrighty, I now officially feel sort of bad about my last review on this place, but it was indeed an honest review that was based on my few experiences at the time. Here is my updated review in which I have been into this store maybe three times in the past six months and the dude I have dealt with here has been generally very helpful. \n\nHis knowledge and time that he took with me to figure out various equipment technical details to update my draft system was really appreciated. I also truly appreciated his honesty when he wasn't sure what the correct answer was on the grains I wanted to use for a recipe. I won't hold it against him that he isn't a fan of IPAs either. \n\nAnother thing that I would like to mention is that their prices here are right in line if not better than most the popular online homebrew stores and you don't have to pay shipping. I am now back on their bandwagon.	1
This school is a terrible deal for what you pay.  I got my math degree here, and I feel my educations was average at best, so why did I pay twice as much? They don't have rigorous science programs here, and even their beloved pharmacy school seems to be self-serving to artificially inflate graduation rates.\n\n The money does not go to the professors -- many of them are part-time adjuncts who do not earn much, so despite small classrooms, they are burnt out and don't have time to devote to their lesson plans.  I do not support this unethical business practice.  \n\nThe campus itself is garbage, there were cockroaches all through the dorms and food quarters when I was there 2006-2010, the dorms are old and falling apart, there is no campus life to speak of.  \n\nIn general there is just really no reason to come here and pay twice as much money for this garbage school.  I left this school 60k in debt and could have gotten the same or better education elsewhere - I DO NOT recommend this school.	0
I would give Carolina Auto Repair no stars if possible. \nI took my car here for a simple oil change. When I picked my car up and started to drive home my hood flew open and broke my windshield also destroyed my hood.\nJohn (the owner) refused to pay for the damages even though it was clearly his fault. He was very disrespectful to my father and I while lying about who actually did the work on my car.\nWe are now going to sue him for damages.	0
Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back!	0
Worst wendy's I have ever been to in my travels all over the USA. Normally Wendy's is at the top of my fast food list. This particular location is HORRIBLE. AVOID !!!	0
3x. So far so good.	1
I have been to this location maybe 10 times in the past few years and every time I go through the drive through the order is wrong. No fries, no salad dressing with salad, no fork, and the last straw was at the bottom of my chili bowl it was about a 6in piece of paper. Avoid!!	0
All I wanted was a quick burger to take out, and I never got to even order. Sunday night at 7 PM shouldn't be peak dining time, but the drive thru line was 10 cars long. So in to the lobby I went, and waited in line inside rather than out. I waited, and waited, then waited a little more. After 5 minutes without getting closer to the register, I gave up. That was enough for me. In the end, I probably added a year to my life skipping my order anyway.	0
"I get take-out from here occasionally, purely out of convenience and lack of competition.  During my last pick-up, the evening of 6-22-12, I witnessed a patron quietly complaining about the confusion and lack of separation between those waiting to pay, waiting for an order, and waiting to be seated.  The front waiting area was in mass confusion.  The response from the manager on duty was to insult the patron, saying \""grown men should be able to wait on pizza, and basically, I don't care\"".  This is not an acceptable response for management.  \nThe quality of our pizza is mediocre at best, with the toppings being more than 2 inches from the edge on a hand tossed pizza.  The lady at the register was friendly as usual.\nThis Pizza Hut is not a top choice, but ok in a pinch."	0
"Smells\n\nGood service, good food but the place smells like an old, musty motel room. I'm local and have been there several times and it always smells. There's almost a \""needs cleaning\"" public bathroom tinge to it as well. \n\nYou'll know; stop where the little foyer ends about 15' inside the front door and inhale through your nose.\n\nIt's an old place so it's time for renovation or replacement."	0
Took my Mom here today for a post Mother's day lunch. It's been about a year since our last visit. Salad bar is a one trip deal only and the salad plates are smaller than I remember last time. Hushpuppies are 2 bite sized and are very good with the right amount of sweetness and onion. My Mom got the senior flounder plate and I got one of the specials which was salt and pepper catfish fillets. Both included a side and the one trip to the salad bar.\nFood was good, but both our flounder and catfish were on the thin side and not very meaty. Service was very friendly and attentive.\nLunch set me back $23 with drinks tax and tip which I thought was really pricey for lunch especially with the thin pieces of fish and considering my Mom ordered off of the senior menu and I got one of the specials.	0
My wife got food poisoning from here. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.....	0
Always had great food, Try the clam chowder!!!	1
Good seafood and decent prices. If you want fancy food, this isn't the place for you. If you want alcohol with your meal go elsewhere as well. However, if you want good fish/shrimp at a good price served quickly and efficiently - this is your place. You can get fried, broiled or boiled (shrimp).	1
The oysters and scallops where good but not $17 good.  This place is way over priced. If you come here be sure to check the prices before you order and ask if it's extra if you add scallops to to your meal.   Fired oysters and scallops over $17 here.  This will be the last time I come here.	0
Had breakfast here one time and it was very primitive. Coffee was really bad.  I took one drink and trashed it.   Have been told they survive on the burgers.  Will have to try one and update but breakfast is a Not Recommend.	0
Very good BBQ, and AMAZING onion rings!!!   We are headed there again tonight for our second trip in the past three weeks.	1
Used to be my favorite pizza and sub shop but has really gone down hill the past year or so.  Many have mentioned how their recent visits have been dissapointing.	0
really wanted a sub. and saw this place driving by on a road trip. thought I would support small business at the same time. but they don't even seem to have SUBS. The food was horrible- I think they served me fries from the day before and they weren't even reheated.  The staff was rediculously unfriendly... it's like the 70s down here still ;-/\nWish I got the WO memo on this place and not wasted my money, just threw that food in the trash, didn't even want my dog to eat it.	0
I came in here with my neighbor! I ordered the steak and cheese and he ordered the meatball sub. Not only was our order fast, it was SO good. The elderly woman was as sweet as could be & the young man that brought us our food was cheerful. I love the Celtic photos on the wall, and the amount of people that draw on the wooden seats provide a homey, childhood-esque feel to the place. \n\nGood food, good service & good atmosphere. You can't go wrong.	1
food was okay but the place is filthy. Tables were dirty. Dead flies in window seals. Window blinds have food residue splattered on them.  Ceiling fans have dust caked on them. Gross...	0
I have been eating here since I was a little girl, and it is always the same!  It is friendly, simple, and delicious!  The sub bread is so good and the crinkle fries are awesome too.  Don't expect fancy, but do expect a good lunch.	1
Astonished!  Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs, Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up.  Hour later I called, got brash woman (owner!) Who told me it was my mistake~  I asked if they would deliver, but hoped for a fresh pie~  whoa  - absolutely not!  \nWhen I asked how we could compromise,  she said she was deleting the order. Well ok I guess.\nI even called back to speak with manager (that's how I figured out she was owner)  and she absolutely didn't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.\n\nSad for them, she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not very successful~  and I'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities don't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza, pretty pathetic huh?\nKelly.

I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, but I love bowling & it'd be nice not to have to travel to Gastonia or Charlotte to bowl. There must be a reason this place is always empty... even with its dirt cheap prices. With that said, I went once a few years ago and vowed never to go back. \n\nThe floors are so oily, I slipped or fell on my walk up every single time!!! I wasn't able to find the 6 lb. ball within the already limited selection. Food is limited and all fried, that's not a good thing either. I couldn't wait to leave, I remember thinking: this place is trying to kill me.\n\nPlease just increase your prices and invest in some upgrades.	0
My biggest complaint deals with packages coming into the facility from private carriers like FedEx. If you've ordered a package and this happens, expect to wait about a week for them to deliver the package. Two day shipping turns into a week and a half. \n\nLong, long wait in lines. No concern for your packages. Terrible delivery - drivers have crammed packages into my box causing damage. If you can afford to, go with UPS.	0
This has to be the worst company in the world..how are they still in business..customer services like Dealing with a zoo.. Nobody takes responsibility for anything.. Please therefore  do not ship any package USPO.. And why as a public are we worrying about them privatising the mail.. Remember public word-of-mouth is everything I was I would have known about the services before hand .. Now I know & will be speeding  the world to everyone I know. To avoid using the post office by all means.. Pay your bills online they offer fee money orders @ some money cash place. I hope this help someone before it's two late for them	0
I'm a big fan of mc d's but I was expecting more when I saw pork chop biscuit what a fail.	0
12/11    Most unreliable WiFi in town. The manager will look you straight in the eye and lie to you about a cut antenna but I've tested with multiple devices and times/dates and know this isn't true.\n\n1/12     STILL the most unreliable WiFi in town! Does zero good to complain. Obvious they could care less.	0
Having people that don't speak English very well taking orders in the drive thru is a recipe for failure.  I always try to double check but feel rushed because of the amount of people behind me. My order is right 50% of the time.	0
Worst McDonalds in the United States of America. I could get food faster in a prison cell. You have a better chance of the Pope going to hell than getting good service here.	0
"Most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me. They get the job done but sometimes they are slow or the bathroom is rank or the fries are soggy or something. \n\nThis McDonald's is by far the worst fast food experience I've ever had. They had about 3-5 employees working at around 12 am on a Saturday night. There were about 15 of us in line and it took over an hour to get our food...... An hour for \""fast\"" food. I could have went into an ihop and had two sit down meals during that time frame and filled up gas. \n\nThe employees did not seem to care and had no sense to work faster. Didn't feel like they spoke English well and an overall sense of indifference towards the customers. I would avoid this McDonald's at all costs, a below mediocre McDonald's with probably terrible management allowing the employees to be so apathetic and worried only about getting their hours in. \n\nAVOID!!"	0
Great place to shoot a rifle or gun.  Pro shop is small, but staff is knowledgeable and friendly. They also offer specials on gun packages that other places do not offer, but you have to visit to see what is on special as they are not advertised.\n\nOffer gun range memberships which can be more economical than the hourly rates for those who shoot at least once a month.  Membership includes free gun rental which allows the customer to 'try out' a variety of guns before making any purchase.  AMMO is expensive everywhere, and that is not an exception here.  $30 for one box of 9mm range ammo, but much cheaper for 22 ammo.  Ammo availability has not been an issue here.\n\nClasses are offered for guns and women's self defense(no gun).  A great service to the public.\n\nThere is only one restroom and it is not nice.  Bring a toilet cover and your own wipes.	1
Shooters express is my local gun range. The range staff is knowledgeable and willing to help if you have a malfunction or an issue. \nI like that they have monthly range packages available. Instead of only charging by the hour for about $40 a month you can go and shoot as much as you want with free range time so I have to pay for targets.  You have to bring your own ammunition of course or buy theirs.  \nTheir pro shop staff is honest about the quality of the firearms I tell them what I'm planing on using it for, self-defense, hunting small game and they trying to recommend something that might be useful to me even if it is less expensive than the item I was looking at at first.	1
Here for trivia night on Tuesday night. Love me some Christina but they are way under staffed. It took almost an hour to get out food. Good food but this is ridiculous.  We had to go to the bar to order drinks. They need to get some help in here or people will stop coming!	0
Service has improved and the food is good	1
I'm not one to complain, and I am not a picky eater, but that was undoubtedly the worst meal I have ever had. For eggs Benedict that came out over 30 minutes after ordering it, I would've expected it to at least be edible. The hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it. The only decent part of the meal was the potatoes, which were just roasted with salt and pepper. Definitely will not be returning for food.	0
Just had the worst experience at a nail salon. A older male nail technician did my nails and i usually get the pink and white fill. He needs another class with filling in the white part and an attitude adjustment.  See pic.  I told him I didn't like it he said I was picky and they looked better than what I came in with. What???? Really I said. Ok. He said it's not gonna be perfect cause it's not a full set. Smh. I had just the white done and both at the same time from my regular nail technician can't wait till she's off maternity leave so disappointed. Tips on other places I can go hit me up! Two stars for bad attitude and he knew it was bad he told me I didn't have to pay full price. So I didn't pay for the white. Still just messed up. If u go there don let him do your pink n white he probably good at other things just not that.	0
Absolute worst experience at a nail salon. My friend & I went to get our nails done, where the older man that worked there did mine. He had a very bad attitude & when I asked him to fix the shaping of my nails, he got mad and got nasty. My acrylics now look like crap, and i have cuts on my cuticles. My friend's nails looked like a 5 year old did them. Horrible paint job, shaping & when we went to go pay, the lady who did her nails over charged her by $15.00. We then had to go back in, so she could get her money back. Never going there again.	0
Best nail salon ever!! They always do a great job and the prices are very affordable. Everyone is always very nice and want to make sure that you are satisfed. I wouldn't go anywhere else.	1
Great location.  Kids really enjoy all the activities.	1
As a parent of a swimmer this is really not a great pool for watching a meet. The stands are small and the tiny results scoreboard is blocked by the crowd if not directly behind you. Parking is atrocious. The positive is the pool is pretty new and in good condition .	0
I hiked here with my dog the other day and fell in love. It's true what they say about the horses though, you have to be careful where you walk! We hiked through there for about an hour taking our time and never came across anyone riding horses and barely came across people. We were there super early though so that may have been the reason. Now that I have discovered this park I will be here all the time, a great place to get away from the 'city'.	1
Great place for hiking - the trails are pretty clear and there are lots of them! Only wish there were bathroom facilities near the entrance to the trails. Also, the raptor center is pretty cool - took my son a couple of years ago and will be taking him again this year now that he's a little older. Other than that, haven't really done any of the tours or horseback riding, but a great place for an outing with the kids!	1
I definitely learned alot about the south here. Really glad we spent a few hours here.  Makes you appreciate modern times.	1
Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it	1
My daughter first took horseback riding lessons here over 15 years ago. We found it to be a solid and affordable place for her as a beginner. The instructor that she had at the time was very patient and kind to kids as well as the horses.  He was able to teach her all the basics and gave her a good foundation for her later training. \n\nLater on, we ended up moving to a stable much closer to home that offered more challenges for her as well as more opportunities for competition -especially in the hunter-jumper arena. \n\nHowever, we have have been back to Latta many times for her to compete in dressage shows and have also come back for trail rides. \n\nIf you are interested in a trail ride or beginner lessons, they have some really gentle horses.  The facilities are nice for horse and rider alike.	1
HISTORIC LATTA PLANTATION\nCome check out this historica plantation if you're into old history about how farm life and slavery was back in the days in North Carolina. Small quaint houses and animals adorn this quiet farmstead. Luckily for me, today, there was a WWII reenactment happening this weekend.\n\nOn the night of July 9th, 1943, the Allied invasion of Sicily , codenamed Operation Husky, commenced. This proved to be a very important WWII campaign which incorporated both amphibious and airborne operations. The Battle For Sicily consisted of 6 hard weeks of land combat pushing the Axis Army into Italy. This kicked off the Italian Campaign which would last until the end of the war in Europe. The Allied Army was made up of soldiers from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Newfoundland, and the Free French - a total of 160,000 personnel. The Axis Army was made up of soldiers fro Italy and Germany - a total of 290,000 personnel.\n\nHere, in this reenactment, German soldiers take over a plantation and battle both US and British armed forces, where they are defeated when they get attacked on both sides. Even with a German halftrack, the battle is lost for the Germans!	1
Took the guided house tour on a Friday morning. The four of us were the only people taking the tour, which was really nice because we had all of our questions answered and were able to spend a good bit of time in the main Latta house. The grounds are really beautiful and after your house tour you can walk around and see the animals and smaller houses on the plantation. This is definitely a must for anyone from Charlotte or visiting Charlotte.	1
My boyfriend and I were excited to try out the amazing maize maze on a sunday afternoon. We were disappointed. It costs $10.00 per person and for the price, didn't really impress us. There are loud speakers all over the maze and the person on the other end of the speaker was loud and distracting. Sprinkled between the woman's loud voice on the speakers was the same country song playing over and over again. It took us 55 minutes to get through the maze and by the end, we both had headaches from the loud speaker noise. Not worth the money :/	0
This is an amazing way to spend a fall afternoon. You will get your daily dose of exercise and more. My preteen daughter who normally only likes to brood in her room even enjoyed it. Great thing to do with your middle school aged kids. There were quite a few people there toting toddler age kids around on their backs. I thought they must have been crazy. Last place I would want to be is stuck in a maze with a cranky 2 year old. \n\nIt took us 1 hour and 15 minutes to get out and we promptly rewarded ourselves with some fried oreos from the food tent outside the maze. There are other things to do such as a hayride and corn hole. Plus they have soccer goals set up. Will be returning next year!	1
The GF and I have done this for the last 2 years and love it.  We've gone for the night maze both times and had a blast.  It is NOT an easy thing to get through, so be prepared to be patient.  You will go through the same area multiple times completely by accident, but you'll eventually figure it out.  This is definitely something that will continue being an annual tradition for us.  Nothing better than getting lost in a cornfield for an hour or 2 on a crisp autumn night.	1
I suppose I'm biased because I've always loved raptors, owls particularly.  But I very much enjoyed seeing the owls, vultures, hawks, falcons, eagles, kestrels, and lively visiting corvidae (ravens, crows and magpies).  These are probably the chillest raptors you'll ever see.  I guess it'd kind of be like visiting an outdoor rehab center for permanently injured athletes.  These birds were once the rulers of the sky, swooping down on irritating prey like rats and skunks in the blink of an eye... until some sad tragedy, a bullet, a car moving too quickly - cut short their majestic reign.  So these raptors, for the most part fairly acclimated to human presence, will merely eyeball you as you walk by their aviaries or embarrass yourself by clicking and hooting to get their attention.\nStop in for the mini-lecture for an up close view of some of the birds, as well as some interesting background information.	1
"*disclaimer up front*\nI am a transport volunteer for the injured raptors coming into this facility. Most of my \""deliveries\"" get euthanized because of the severity of their injuries... and I see this place as the single best way to educate John Q. Public about why these birds die needlessly every day. \nBefore I became a transporter, I visited here at the urging of friends... and, friend, I was hooked. This is one of the best, intelligent displays/educational interactions of birds of prey I have ever seen. I bring my friends and family here whenever they visit because it is that cool, and that important. I even have a friend who also became a volunteer here after visiting."	1
Although I'm scared of bird (I suffered a vicious peacock attack as a child (seriously)), this place was pretty cool.\n\nWe just happened to arrive as one a raptor presentation was beginning.  Seeing a presentation is a must (the trip would have not been as good without it).  The woman doing the presentation brought out a number of birds and told us lots of interesting info about them.\n\nAfter that, we just walked around to the different cages and checked out the other birds.  If you want to take pictures, bring a camera with a zoom lens (I couldn't get close enough for my iPhone pictures to be very good).	1
We are new to the area but really enjoyed our first season w/Strikers.  Super nice office staff & they really seem to love the game & encourage the kids to Have fun & enjoy the game.  The format is slightly different...more like an indoor set up w/the walls but it makes for a faster/always moving game & helps to improve skills at a faster pace.	1
"Beware of this place. We had a mini-dachshund that had a bleeding ulcer. Test after test after test they were still not sure what was wrong with this young 7 year old dog. Ultimately after about $3400 worth of tests they wanted to operate to see if there was something that they were missing. How much? Another $5000. Unfortunately he had already lost too much blood, so surgery was definitely too risky and they knew that. We would up bringing our pup to another vet for a second opinion and the fix was not as invasive or expensive as CVS. Please bring your animal somewhere else! They will make you go broke and play on your feelings. Very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners. To add to this, we have had other friends and family members that have had similar experiences. So yourself and you pet a favor and don't go to these \""specialists\""."	0
Excellent, full service dry cleaning & alterations  Have been using them for the past six years and have nothing but accolades for them.  If you live in the Stallings area, you should be using them.	1
On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses, pants, etc but they charged me for the items. Not happy. I've decided that im not coming back to this place.	0
Take out - No dine in - Friendly staff - Very good Pizza, better than most!  Fast, fast, fast service, great quality, great taste!  Ate here (in there parking lot) Sunday night!\n\nI'm almost sure the Cheese they use is 100% Mozzarella (instead of a blend) I am a Fan of this Pizza with EASE!  If they were located closer to me I would be getting more Pizza from them vs Fuel!	1
This pizza is mediocre at best. Not really a NY style pizza - the crust is soggy, they finely chop the toppings - definitley not worth getting excited over.	0
First time trying NY Pizza Express tonight, and I am very glad I did! \nFound a menu online to have a look at prices, very reasonable, actually I was surprised at how cheap they were. We order 2 large pies, one just mozz, the other sausage & bacon, for delivery on a Saturday evening. They gave us a 30-40 min time estimate, and were in my driveway no more than 20 minutes later! Good friendly service both on the phone, and from the delivery driver. \nPizza was great, nice slightly chewy crust, thin, but  not too thin. Good amount of sauce, and cheese tasted very fresh! It was really good. Super happy to have tried this place, now I just need to try their subs, calzones, and everything else! \nThanks NY Pizza Express!	1
My family actually prefers this place to other pizza places in the area - or did before they stopped serving the onion rings! This place had some of the best onion rings, but mysteriously, they stopped serving them! \n\nThe pizza here is a lot like NJ/NY pizza. Cheesy with a crisp/bendy crust. The pizza really is very good. The mozzarella sticks are great also. \nPlease bring back the onion rings guys!! The meatball and chicken parm. sandwiches are VERY good. Great bread too.( the meatball sub could use a few more meatballs but is still delicious)\n\nWe still love ya and will order from you often!	1
"They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\"" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again."	1
"I wasted nearly twenty bucks on the driest and most boring white pizza ever! The whole dinner was nothing but a downer. Plus the sample we got was way undercooked, after eating the first slice we decided to bake it for another five minutes.\n\nOnce reheated the crust wasn't bad, not soggy or cardboard like but way thick for an alleged NY pizza. The topping unfortunately didn't get any worse or better for it, it was as solid as it was bland.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than just one is that I suspect their plain pizza is better than average for this forsaken area. \n\nYou've been warned: in Matthews-Stallings 5 stars amounts to just average out on in the modern world, and 4 stars here translates to \""it's pretty much crap but we have no better\"" ."	0
"Very good pizza!  This is usually our \""go to\"" for pizza when the kids aren't around (they prefer Pizza hut) .  Pretty authentic NY Style pizza although a little bit on the pricey side."	1
If you ever thought it was impossible to wait too long in the drive-thru, while you are the ONLY person there.....drop in on this hole in the wall.  It is possible!	0
This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!	0
Either my English muffin sandwich sat under a hot lamp all morning OR Burger King's kitchen staff just decided to deep fry the whole damn thing.  If that's not enough, the sausage smelled of animal decay.\n\nJust awful.	0
"UGH.\n\nNasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. \n\nSometimes when you have kids, you have to eat somewhere to appease them. I used to only go to BK if I was \""stopped up\"" and needed a release. Well, that's still definitely the case after eating there Friday night since I made intimate friends with my commode both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThis place is filthy. \n\nThe food is atrocious.\n\nThe employees are miserable (one of the cooks....No. the ONE cook was dressed in street clothes-whatever happened to uniforms?).\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"	0
I'm a car guy and I can spot a fellow car guy and that folks at Tullock are car guys. This family-owned shop is friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly honest. It's easy for mechanics to take advantage of customers that wouldn't know better. These guys don't do that at all. Plus, if you're info older and classic cars, they can do a restoration too. If you're looking for an honest mechanic to help your car last that much longer (as we all are), give Todd a call	1
I was in Charlotte visiting family over Spring Break when my engine started misfiring.  It was Good Friday afternoon and I was planning to drive back to Chicago the following day. All the auto shops were going to be closed for the holiday weekend, so I knew I had to get it taken care of that day.  I called and spoke to Todd, who told me it might be a bigger job than they had time for, but told me to bring it right over and he'd see what he could do. \nI'm SO glad I brought it there.  Three men worked together to quickly diagnose the problem, go get the part I needed, WASHED the car while they were waiting for the part (just to be nice!!) and solved my problem in about an hour.  The price they charged me was much less than I expected, and I can honestly say it was the BEST car repair experience I have ever had.\nPlease take your car to these guys with confidence.  There's just no way you'll regret it.	1
When my girlfriend and I moved from NY we had to find someone reliable and trustworthy to work on our vehicles.  Tullock automotive has not disappointed us.  \n\nTodd, his wife and the rest of his staff have been our go to for anything automotive while we have lived here.  Their flexibility, honesty and friendliness are why we keep coming back.  \n\nIf you live in the area or not they are worth the drive to check them out.  You will not be disappointed in the service.  Tullock automotive is a great local business in Stallings.  If you have vehicle issues do not hesitate to give them a call.	1
I came to Tullock because my wife and i are big on Yelp. I recently purchased a vehicle after i lost my other car in a recent auto accident. The car i purchased had numerous issues and financially i was in a bind. I came hoping that I'd find a mechanic that was honest and that wouldn't take advantage of me. All i can say is Mr. Tullock went above and beyond his duties to help me. I can't even begin to say how thankful i am for his service! Mr. Tullock is a man of integrity and character! I seldom have ever came across people like him. Not only did i find a mechanic i made a friend! There's no one else I'd even trust my car with! All i can say is my family and i thank him from the bottoms of our hearts! We are in your debt sir! Tullock Automotive is 2nd to none! Hands down best shop in Matthews maybe even in all of North Carolina!	1
Todd is a great mechanic good person! His wife was so very nice I have told a lot of people about this place just because of his character! Thank you todd so very much as soon as I get my new hot rod its your to fix!	1
"When my car was down and out and I was trying to decide to fix it or junk it, I took it Matthews Imports for a second opinion.  On the phone, it was \""sure, we'll check it out\"" and that remark cost me the fee for him to hook it up to his scanner machine.\n\nDude, I knew the transmission was bad...the car tells you that.  \n\nThey did follow up with a couple of options that were slightly less than my normal mechanic but unfortunately, it wasn't what I wanted.  Still I could have gotten over it but the straw that broke the camel's back was when I got into the car, went to close the OBD port and the knee pad was covered in grease.  YUCK!  \n\nThey couldn't be nicer people but not for me.  Sorry."	0
This review is long overdue, my apologies to Gary & staff.\n\nThey first worked on my 96 Infiniti I30 about 5-years ago and I have done business with them on a few other occasions when needed.  Each time they have been less expensive but not of lower quality and certainly more of a straight-shooting, above the table approach.  I have not been dissatisfied, even when I returned with a concern of the work they had performed, they've made it right each time.  I've taken three vehicles to them over the years, the '96 I30, a '97 Camry, and an '06 Sienna.  I have been thoroughly pleased with economics (by comparison) and quality each time.	1
Atmosphere aside, the food here was good. Particularly the general tso chicken. It was crispy not soggy like some places. It looks like your typical take out chinese joint so our expectations were not high to begin with but we enjoyed the food and would definitely go back.	1
Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back	0
Not recommended. Szechuan beef tasted like ketchup. Spring roll spongy and tasted bad. Pork fried rice is OK.  My daughter likes the Sesame Chicken but too sweet for my taste.	0
It is too bad I can't give this zero stars.  Eat at your own risk!  I had Kung Pao Chicken and got really bad food poisoning.   The chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful. I will never go back here again.	0
Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again.	0
Well for this being my first stay here with my family and pet. I must say the front desk crew and management are amazing.(Todd & Melissa) Very professional and friendly and helped make our stay a good one.	1
So far, have only needed their services for bi-annual preventive maintenance/routine checkup but they have been very pleasant to work with.	1
(Occurred last summer, just now updating)\n\nFound myself with very simple issue on a ~6-year old unit - exhaust fan (outside) failed.  Very disappointed in response I received from McLintock when I contacted them seeking to purchase replacement fan and install myself.  The representative insisted on $90 service call to determine issue.  Them stood behind some policy that they couldn't sell parts.  I understand to a degree but they've lost a customer due to their insistence on making a buck and lack of willingness to help or direction to solve my issue.  This highlighted how they've tried to upsell me on every visit for the past couple years - I overlooked previously because I have no issue saying 'No.'\n\nI wound up finding a replacement fan online, thru a willing merchant; installed myself and all is well for a year now.	0
Everything was great except that the water in the shower WOULD NOT heat up, ever, rendering it unusable. I ended up taking a sponge bath with the aid of the sink. \nTo be fair we didn't tell the staff because it was late at night and weren't too keen on switching rooms or having some maintenance guy come up.	1
Great food! awesome Margaritas!	1
Great Mexican at a great price. Margaritas are awesome too. Servers are polite and service is quick. This is our go-to place for Mexican around the gaston county area.	1
"If you crave a little nostalgia, Brightstar Drive-In is a throwback to a simpler, more neighborly time. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple: The LottaBurger that made them famous, pizza, onion rings, tater tots and the like.\n\nWhat I love about Brightstar, though, is the escape it provides from chain restaurants and Charlotte's \""Fisher Price\"" design. Tucked in a quiet wooded lot in Mt. Holly, the place reminds me of burger joints I visited near my grandparents' camp in New York's southern tier as a kid.\n\nGrab a deck of cards, a few friends, and head out to Brightstar for an evening. It's not too far from the Belmont Drive-In Theatre, so you could make a true throw-back experience out of it."	1
went there with my fiance and the food was not at all what i expected from the reviews.\nwe got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries. \nthe bun was deflated and soggy. the burger meat itself looked promising but was burnt and vastly overcooked.. \n\nSAVE your money on the chili cheese fries. at $3.99, you get maybe two handfuls of their fries with two small spoons of unidentifiable meat (pork? beef?!) and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station. \n\nthey do have their own radio station with great music, and fun books to read while you wait. regrettably the food was just not what we were expecting, and it is such a shame.	0
Salad bar was simple but delicious. The lotta burger was a must try! The salad bar also came with fresh pizza. Super nice staff and nostalgic feel made this a great treat after our mega jump!	1
It's like Happy Days, without Richie and The Fonz. Great burgers, great fries, and diet sundrop on tap. No place else like it. Oh, and a radio station broadcasting 50's and 60's hits from the diner too. If you're lucky, they'll play a request for you. Love this place when i'm in Mt. Holly or Belmont.	1
For japanese fast food, I love it. I can run in, order, head out pretty quick. The staff is friendly. If you want to eat the place has always been really clean. I just wished they deliveried!  :))	1
Went there last night, great concept, good looking food ... Tasteless and bland.	0
It's MCDONALDS! You wanted a review.. Ok keep your panties on... here it is...\n\nThe place is always slammed (yay for fast food).. You think going into a drive-thru is fast.. It's not. Make sure you check your order as it often comes back wrong - the place is run by 16-19 year olds I swear to god. \n\nIt's a clean place. Well there's something.. It's fast food so you don't have to cook - although I don't know why I'm saying fast in anything because they are not here.. Lastly, it's on the way through Mt. Holly on the way to 85. \n\nAnd that's your 20 second review.. I warned ya.	0
Stay away. Since my review nearly a year ago, this place has gone from bad to worse. Every order is wrong. The problem exists at both the ordering process in the drive through, but also in the order picking by staff even if the order was right. How sad. This is the worst McDonald's and worst customer service of any restaurant in any category. Here's what to expect:\n\nLong lines\nRude customer service that claim its the customer's fault\nIncorrect orders every time\nCold fries\n\nThis is one of the restaurants I worry about that spits in food that retaliate insteed of fixing problems. They have added convenient waiting stations for your car to park so that they can hopefully match the order with the car. Too bad even then the orders are not right. What's worse? Nothing changes even when they aren't busy. \n\nAvoid this location.	0
This hotel was ok, the Host -Quntin was great., the room took a while to heat up. and the food was good and alot ( dinner). the cheapest thing on the menu was $12.00. The room was wonderful other then the heat part. When it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad. bacon was cooked to hard, the eggs were hard, the fruit was the only thing they could not mess up. that cost me $15.00 (not happy) I went here because my flight got bumped and the next flight was not until the next day. ( not happy). When i went to the bar for dinner they had hockey on and i ask could they change the channel to CNN OR SOMETHING else the guy said no !! all 6 of the tv had to stay on that channel it was a wiring problem.	0
Lobby, restaurant, bar and internet area all look great and new! Room Service was great, fast and efficient. Check in was good, not great! They charge for internet service in the room, that's so 2008!\n\nThis is a typical 80 style building that was retrofitted and remodeled. So The main structure, bathroom and HVAC systems all pose a ongoing problem, no matter the extensive renovation.\n\nFrom a cleanliness perspective the room had spider webs around every corner of the ceiling.	0
"I get really annoyed with these \""fancy\"" hotels who don't offer the refrigerator and microwave in their standard rooms, which I can get at a Holiday Inn Express or a Comfort Inn for probably half the price.  \n\nAlso, for the love of all things holy, don't charge people for WiFi in 2011 after they already paid you an arm and a leg for a room that isn't worth it.  That is RIDICULOUS.\n\nThere's at least a half-mile walk (without a sidewalk) to anything except a small convenience store.\n\nThe room was comfortable enough, but no greater than any 3-star hotel I've ever stayed in."	0
This is a decent hotel.  Decent for a quick over-nighter if you've missed a flight.  But it's not good for longer stays or repeat visits.  The building itself needs updating.  The food at breakfast is OK. But lunch/dinner is like bar food.  Half of the floors don't have vending machines.  One of the floors that does does not offer drinks.  One machine that offered drinks keeps your money without providing a drink.  The other working machine is all out of stock.  Bottled water in the room is $4.00 (before they tack on other BS charges).  Internet access is $9.95 per day.  3G reception in the building is horrible too!  It's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.\n\nI'd recommend staying somewhere else if you can!	0
The staff was friendly and helpful. That's the only reason this place gets a star. After 10 hours on the road we stumbled in here thinking, how bad can a Sheraton be? Answer: pretty bad! A huge number of kids were staying here for a soccer tournament. No one appeared to be supervising these children who ran screaming through the lobby and restaurant/bar area for entire evening. Actually they were also running and yelling in and out of elevators and hallways, too! It was a tired person's worst nightmare. The room was clean, but the carpeting was terribly stained and the furniture scratched. The bed was, thankfully, comfortable. Just to finish things off, the bill slipped under the door that night was totally wrong. I'd say, skip this one. You can surely do better!	0
This hotel looks a lot better than it smells. The lobby has the stench of too much cheap air fresher and the rooms, furnished in the 1970s faux wood motel style, carry the unpleasantly musty stink of the unconcealed carpet stains. \n\nMy room overlooked a dreary parking lot but on the bright side, the Internet was relatively quick and the hotel is minutes from the airport and the interstate. There are no decent food options within walking distance. \n\nCharlotte is such a nice town, this hotel and its environs won't do your trip justice. Surprised that this meets the Starwood standard.	0
Staff are great - friendly and helpful. Beds are hit or miss. Some beds are noticeably  older and squeak horribly. Some are as comfy as could be. As usual, Sheraton pillows are amongst the best. Restaurant, bar, pool, and lobby are nice as well.	1
"Pretty lobby, but had problems with the hotel staff.  We held a meeting there and had no problems with the room, the AV or the catering.  However, as a guest, I would not go back.  \n\nThe lobby is pretty, but the room did have a smell to it.  \n\nThe internet connection in my room was intermittent and when I called, I was told, \""I don't know what you want me to do about it . . \""  She didn't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly, rude.  I had the same problem on my laptop, iPad and iPhone.  It wasn't me.  \n\nI asked to take a muffin from the restaurant into the meeting room and, at first, they didn't want to let me - at all.  When they did, they charged me for the full buffet.  \n\nOthers in our group had problems as well."	0
This is my favorite Wing place, whether I go in person or have my food delivered. The owners are nice and so are those they have working with them. Even when they have forgotten something on my order during a delivery, they made sure to bring it back promptly. I think they are very accommodating.	1
"I've been a longtime loyal customer of this place (2005). My husband and I just called to order delivery and the girl that answered the phone hung up on him. When I called back she told me \""that wasn't me, it must've somebody else. \"" When I spoke to the \""manager\"" he said they weren't delivering tonight.  On Super Bowl Sunday.  A wing place.  Not delivering.  Ok. I don't need to spend my money there."	0
Ive been a customer for years and i went there today amd my chicken sandwhich i ordered it was completely frozen i took it back and they made me a new one with no sauce on it and it was completely dried out and over cooked. And the guy wanted to argue back. Im never going back.	0
"sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say \""that's sick! \"" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. \n\nAfter driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.\n\nMy noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said \""sign-this\"" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. \n\nI should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall!"	0
I too don't understand the low ratings for this place. As others have said you've got to keep your expectations in perspective when visiting a mall food court. For a quick and tasty fast food experience I really love Sarku Japan. They do cook the food fresh to order and I usually order their Teriyaki chicken special. Their teriyaki isn't too sweet which I like and it carmelizes on the chicken for a really great flavor. Because I'm a big guy who likes to eat I get the double meat, spring roll and drink combo. All this for just over $10. In my book and palate I think this is a pretty good deal.	1
The customer service here is amazing! I called on a Saturday with an impromptu lunch order for 18 box lunches. Lakeisha, the awesome employee that answered the phone didn't flinch when I said I needed the lunches in an hour. \n\nI arrived an hour later and everything was ready and organized. My HOA volunteers thank you and we'll be back...with more notice next time	1
Delicious food (hook and ladder is my favorite). They are quick.  Plenty of space to eat inside or outside. \nGREAT service!	1
Clean, great staff good subs, even better that it right beside Starbucks. They also now take Apple Pay.	1
Service was terrible!! My sister and I walked in this location and were not even greeted with an hello. As we browsed through the store 2 of the sales associates went in the opposite direction when they saw us coming. On our way out of the store both associates were at the front of the store shouting goodbye. I proceeded to tell them I noticed we were intentionally being ignored, how rude they are, and that discrimination is completely wrong. I also so let them know their actions are the perfect way to get bad reviews for the store.\nMy sister and I are 2 professional women (Chemist/Psychologist) we were surprised to witness this type of treatment from furniture salesmen. But I guess when you walk into this location with the wrong skin color you get no service... 2014MLK Day... Smh	0
Garden Ridge has just turned into a junky flea market.  GAG !!!	0
I mentioned to a friend that I was headed to one of the big chains (rhymes with Sprawl-Mart) to pick up some furniture for my balcony. He said I should head here instead and what a great suggestion that was. GR is a MASSIVE store with not just outdoor furniture but they also stock tons and tons of really neat stuff for indoors too. \n\nIn the lawn furniture section, I had a selection of prices colors and styles. I managed to narrow down to a neat and comfy pair of chairs with a foot rest and matching side table. All for less than a hundred bucks! What's not to love?\n\nYep, it's probably only going to last a season or two. But do I really want to pay three times as much for something that will last forever? Sorry, but my budget won't stretch that far.	1
I bought some Halloween lights there a few weeks ago that did not work for, $3.99.  Went back to exchange them for better quality ones without my receipt, they said they could not refund.  I thought that was petty of them to not take them back.  They still got my sale for the better quality ones.  The clerk said she was sorry.  If the management was actually sorry they would have refunded my $3.99 don't you think?	0
Garden Ridge is not the same...it has really gone downhill.  It seems that they have bought out other stores of items that did not sell...junky items.  Every time I go in there I can never find anyone to help me and they only have one register open. Their shopping carts are all rusty and broken. I miss the old Garden Ridge.	0
Is it me or have the prices at Garden Ridge gotten ridiculously high? I admit that I'm more of a seasonal Garden Ridge shopper - Christmas season, but thought I'd go have a look around today...really? Small pressed wood end tables for $149 - $400 for an 8x10' rug? As I looked around more, I realized that most, if not all, of what I'd want could be purchased cheaper at Wal-Mart or Target...and better quality. No wonder the store was empty. There was a sign out front saying that they're planning on revamping the store....I hope that means they'll be sharpening their pencils and cutting those prices or the next sign we'll see out front is For Lease!	0
Very dated, small bathroom, tube TV\n\nBreakfast was good.	0
Thank you everyone who posted reviews. Due to the information I have now researched, I will not be attending this store ever. I will be driving to another dicks location bc clearly this one seems to be one hot mess.	0
Went for lunch today - and very upset that they now CHARGE a $3 fee for a basket of the pretzel rolls at lunch!\n\nSuggestion to the restaurant - simply ask each table if they want bread.  If they say no, you save the cost of the bread.  If they say yes, the bread is likely to be eaten.  \n\nThe charge for the bread isn't worth alienating good customers.\n\nBTW, we didn't have an inexpensive lunch.  Tab for four of us - including two glasses of wine, one beer, three after meal specialty drinks, one dessert and the aforementioned basket of rolls - was over $100.  Did the $3 bread really impact the restaurant profit margin that much?	0
"Went back to the Waldhorn this past Sunday for brunch and had a great visit. Normally, I avoid buffets, but their brunch buffet is nice. I love the cooked-to-order omelette station as well as the selection of  traditional breakfast foods and traditional German foods.  The people are friendly, service was good and quality of the food is excellent.  I would definitely recommend giving them a try for brunch even if you are not typically a fan of \""German\"" food -- I don't eat beef, pork, cabbage, etc but I can certainly find plenty of other options here that are excellent (Sp\u00e4tzle, Chicken, French Toast, Cheese Grits, Home Fries, Fresh Vegetables, Fresh Soup of the day, and delish fresh breads).  Brunch is also an excellent time to try some of their various desserts  such as fruit cobblers,  Napoleons, Bienenstich Kuchen (Honey cake with cream in the middle and honeyed almonds on top),  Black Forest Cake, Apfelstrudel, Eclairs, and many others."	1
Been to Germany? If not, then go. If yes, then no. When I think of German food, I think of the smells of Frankfurt Am Main or the hip little Back Factory spots around Berlin. This place lacks something, it may be Germans. I dunno. Spend 30 bucks on 8 euros worth of food. Do the math it doesn't add up.	0
Just came back from their Sunday Brunch. It was about $15 per person unless you have kids under 4 which are free. The brunch is a great way to try a lot of items in one sitting. They have an omelet station which was decent but I came for the German food. Also at the omelet station was roast beef which was just OK. They have about 30 other lunch items on the buffet. The best part by far is the dessert section which included about 10 additional items. It was not the best German I have had but I would not expect that from a buffet. I will be back to try a menu item another day. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the building had a great German feel.	1
Went for the buffet on Sunday.  As another reviewer said it was set up weird.  Grew up on German food and this didn't compare. Probably good for a restaurant though. Should try ordering from the menu it might be better.	0
This place makes me feel right at home.  Warm and personable, the Waldhorn offers a cozy atmosphere to drink some quality beer on tap.  Mmmm...no skunky green-bottle taste!\n\nThe food isn't by any means anything special...it's just typical German food.  You either like it or you don't.  This guy...does!  And...what would a German restaurant be without some accordian music?  There's just something about polka that makes me want to drink more.  Hmmm?\n\nThe service is excellent, the atmosphere is warm, the food is filling, the prices are reasonable, and you'll feel like part of the family.\n\nDas Waldhorn ist ausgezeichnet!	1
Fairly authentic german food. Great atmosphere. Liked it more before I actually went to Europe and had actual german food. Never going to be quite the same but I still love it! Good place to go for something different and tasty!	1
Best Sunday brunch in Charlotte. Period. I could stop there, but I'll go on.\n\nGreat German beers and German delicacies on the buffet line, including sauerbraten, pork loin cooked with bacon, red cabbage, sauerkraut, you name it. The only thing I didn't see was weiner schnitzel, but maybe they have that on other Sundays? Plus of course, all the usual Sunday breakfast things - an omelette station, scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, etc. And an assortment of dessert items.\n\nGreat service with a smaller-sized dining area that helps keep the meal intimate.\n\nI've not been here for a meal other than brunch, but I will absolutely do so and let you know.\n\nNote: Check their website for the Oktoberfest schedule. The place gets crazy busy and I'm not exaggerating. They have local cops here to direct traffic!	1
AMAZING FOOD, AMAZING BEER!!!! I love this place!\n\nBest European Food in Charlotte, besides my mother's of course....	1
THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BRUNCH. IF IT IS SUNDAY BEFORE 230PM AND YOU ARE READING THIS - STOP. GO TO THE WALHORN. THEN RETURN TO SAID YELP REVIEW AND THANK ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS VERY REAL.\n\nSometimes there are things in life that you just can't express in words full how much such and such means to you. Or how much you hate it. Or love it. This is ALMOST one of those cases, but for you fine people I will spit some lyrical truth about this epic brunch.\n\nBest roast beef in the land\nSliced by hand,\nOn your Command,\nDelish.\n\nBreakfast foods ye seek,\nMight as well get 2 plates,\nFrench toast and hashbrowns peak,\nUnder all that bacon.\n\nSausages are varied,\nMustard with them - heaven.\nSauerbraten, sauerkraut, spaitzel\nOh look, schnitzel - I'll have 7\n\nI love you Waldhorn Brunch.\nI want to spend my life with you.\nThis isn't a poem.\nBRB going for another trip (and don't skip dessert!)	1
Oktoberfest.  Live it.  Love it.  We've gone for my husband's birthday the past 2 years, and it has never failed to disappoint.  SO BUSY though, so book your reservations well in advance or you'll be waiting hours at the door.  The atmosphere is so fun and lively, and you wouldn't look a bit out of place in your lederhosen!  So drag it out of the closet!  I know you have a pair (a set?).  \n\nThe food is, as the other reviews say, wunderbar.  Unbelievable saurkraut.  Pretzel bites are the bomb.  Sausage sampler, exquisite.  They have a special menu for the fest, and I haven't been back to try the non-fest-fare, but it seems to me like anything you pick would be a winner.\n\nBut hands down the best part of Oktoberfest?  The accordion guy.  He is the jam.  He played the Pennsylvania Polka for us Steeler fans, and it was magical (sorry QC peeps, you won't get that, and it's okay).  Just give this guy some love because he's awesome.\n\nI'll post an update if I can ever make it back for Sunday Brunch!	1
The 1st time I have ever ate at this location. You really have to enjoy german food in order to appreciate some of the dishes that is server on the brunch buffet during Sundays. The food that I ate was very tasteful and I really enjoyed being there. During their sunday brunch they will also make omlets on demand with all sorts of different fillings and toppings.	1
So I've yet to go to the Waldhorn for lunch or dinner?  Why, then, am I reviewing it, you ask?\n\nThe answer: OMG brunch buffet.\n\nOk, so at $16 and change, the weekend brunch buffet isn't cheap. But it is plentiful and delicious. Omelettes are made to order (and made well, at that), and there smorgasbord of other selections: everything from pasta to rice to sausage to cake.\n\nOf special note are the sausages and the red cabbage. Especially the red cabbage. If you think cabbage can't be so good as to give you daydreams, well, you haven't had the cabbage here. Even a brunch attendee native to Germany agreed with me on that.\n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive (even though we were difficult and changed tables!) and the decor is entertaining.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because I haven't experienced a full-service meal here yet.  I suspect that is just a matter of time, however.	1
If you enjoy German food, then this is the absolute BEST place in the area.  They have pretzel dough rolls that are just the bomb!  Lets also not forget to mention the copious amounts of awesome imported German beer!!	1
Maybe I just don't like German food but was very unhappy with all the food I tasted. It could have been what I ordered? I was disappointed with the selection of food as well. I ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich and it had way too much sauce on it. My husband let me try a bite of his Rueben which was really good. My kid's loved the authenticity of the restaurant which made it worth it to see them so happy. I wouldn't choose to go back but I am guessing it's probably b/c German food isn't my thing.	0
Great food a staff that knows the food and menu. The Beer club is the best thign going in the area after a tueday at work. Close your eyes and open them quick and your in Germany. Beer selections for the real beer drinkers, go in and get a liter of some good germany brews.	1
Absolutely five stars! Every time I come out this way to see family I make an attempt to stop in. The wait staff is always top notch, the bier is fantastic, the environment is friendly and pleasant; the food is spectacular. Thanks for a wonderful evening!	1
Ate here for dinner with my mom; this was our fourth time here, to which my Mom thoroughly enjoys when visiting me while I'm okay about.  \n\nIn the most recent visit I ordered for appetizer the Goulash Soup, which I found it to be much creamer than expected.  The soup though was very good overall, with chunks of meat and potatoes floating in the mix.  Mom ordered a salad, she enjoyed it.  The rolls were also very good.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Wienerschnitzel, which was okay though a bit tough.  Mom ordered the  Rouladen, which she enjoyed greatly.  Overall, my Mom enjoyed the meal and evening, more than me, which is good.  Personally, I prefer the Sunday brunch more because its a buffet that I can pick what I want.  Overall, I give it four out of five.	1
"Yep...an honest to goodness authentic German restaurant/gasthaus right here south of Charlotte.  Interior is authentic, with open wood beams, banners and other decorations and a authentic menu to boot.\n\nHaving been stationed in Germany with the Army and later in and out for business, I know that I know and this is the real thing.\n\nAbout a dozen German beers on draft (!) and a lot more bottled.  They even have a beer club.  The beer is served in crisply clean logo-ed mugs along with the traditional beer \""decken\"" or cardboard coasters.\n\nMenus for lunch and dinner with cover the waterfront.  Authentic goulash soup and a delirious cream of mushroom soup.  Their German noodles, \""spaetzel\"" are perfect, red cabbage also.  Salad greens with that light vinegar and oil dressing was superb.\n\nWiener-schnitzel was just OK to me...but it was really pork and was not tough.\n\nGreat atmosphere and food, hands down.  We will return and look forward to their annual Oktoberfest, which others say is a great, authentic occasion."	1
This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  Pretzel rolls are served with a spicy mustard on the side that is to die for.  Food and service is always on point.  They have my Husbands favorite draft beer all year round- Oktoberfest.	1
They serve spaten Oktoberfest year round! Great brots, potato pancakes, and pretzel bread!	1
ALWAYS delicious! Oktoberfest is insane every year.	1
You will feel transported to Germany (well, close enough) when you come up the drive for the quaint, authentic building.  5 yelp stars for the beer and the beer list.  The pretzel rolls that came gratis were excellent, and would have been worth an app price if served with a good beer cheese.  The  weiner schnitzel was average good.  It came on a jaeger (brown, mushroom) sauce, which is not traditional at all.  The rouladen was pretty good.  For those not in the know - rouladen is like a rolled up burger with bacon and pickles.  Pretty good!  \n\nBut - Where are the dirndls and lederhosen on the wait staff??  And no German music, no background music at all.  A small touch of ambiance, but authentic music would go a long way.  Our server was from Honduras, and wasn't familiar with German food, but he was honest about the sauerbraten being dry (true) and he was jovial and sincere.  Excellent option for German in Charlotte!  Hoping to come back for Oktoberfest in our dirndl and lederhosen!  Prost!!	1
We had a dinner reservation for 19 people on one of the busiest weekends of the year. The food, service and staff were excellent.	1
My wife and I had our wedding reception here last month and we can't sing their praises enough!  They made it so easy for us so we could focus our attention on everything from actually getting married to coordinating out of town guests joining us.  The staff was helpful, good-natured, seem to be enjoying themselves as much as our guests (our reception was a little unconventional).  Oh, and did I mention the food?  The sausage combination was juicy and delicious, the veggies were crisp and delicious, the pork loin was so tender and the sauce was creamy and tangy, the salad options were all that you could expect from a fine German restaurant (make some extra room for the red cabbage especially), and of course the delicious spatzle made the meal just all we could've hoped for.  If you haven't been here yet, might I suggest checking out the Sunday brunch buffet first to get a good feel for what they have to offer.  This place will hold a special place in our hearts for taking so much stress out of our big day.  :-)	1
Amazing and authentic German food! We just got back from a trip to Germany (Nuremberg and Munich) and the food took me right back to our trip. \n\nWe have been here numerous times for food and beer. They have an excellent selection of Belgium beers....some of these I actually drank in Germany.\n\nCame here for lunch today with my husband. We both ordered the bratwurst sandwich. It was a bratwurst split in half, covered with craut, and on a soft pretzel bun. So many flavors and soooooo good! Definitely recommend it! \n\nOverall, excellent spot with great authentic beer and food. \n\nPS- A few month ago when we went here, we ended up chatting with our server for a long time. She was from Germany and was extremely knowlegable about German food and culture. It was so interesting talking with someone who just recently moved to the US from Germany.	1
First time here this past Friday for lunch. Hadn't had a Wiener schnitzel since Vienna. I really enjoyed Waldhorn 's version. I will be back.	1
Best German food in town. A good traditional beer selection along with traditional favorites such as wurst and schnitzel. Their Oktoberfest tent is a blast and worth a visit. If you can't make it across the pond then the Waldhorn  is a trip worth making.	1
"An all around great restaurant!  The service is friendly and fast and the food does not disappoint.  The sausage plate and goat cheese appetizers are both fantastic as well as the complimentary pretzel rolls.  They have plenty of traditional German fare such as Weinerschnitzel, sauerkraut, spaetzle, etc. and it is all delicious!  Beware: the portions are HUGE.  Luckily, they offer a \""Lite Appetite\"" menu as well. If you save room for dessert, the apple strudel is a must. It's great to have this restaurant in Charlotte, it's very unique and stands out."	1
Now I really try to like this place , especially since my fianc\u00e9 lived in Germany for a few years and when I took him here with friends for his birthday he proposed to me . So of course it is special to me for other reasons. However this site is to help review the food and to be honest I just think it's bland and incredibly boring.. The only items I care for are the red cabbage and the dumplings other than that I have tried several different things because my fianc\u00e9 gets in the mood for German food and this is the only place in Charlotte we know of .. Other than for sentimental reasons though I personally would not chose to eat here.	0
NOT repeat Not for celiacs! The kitchen ignores whatever the server tells them. When the meal comes out wrong, everyone else is done before the plate comes back out. The manager apologizes, but it they don't take it seriously, this happened both times we've been here, but we won't be back. I like the food, but I don't like dining alone.	0
"I compare all German foods and restaurants in one way ... \""Is it as good as Mama Schuele's home cooking?\""\nThe answer is never \""Yes\"", but the Waldhorn is as close as I have ever come to that.\n\nWe come for the Sunday Brunch,  which offers a great selection of breakfast foods along with many German favorites. \n\nI'm currently enjoying that along with a litre of my favorite Hefeweizen. Good times."	1
Really good stuff!!! Service was incredible - pretzel rolls were to-die-for. I think between 3 of us, we had 3 baskets.... Sausages are delectable and spaetzle and red cabbage is awesome. We are to be new regulars!!!	1
What a great restaurant with authentic German food! We arrived Sunday night at 7:30 and the parking lot was pretty full, a good sign. Overall the food was fantastic, flavorful, delicious and served just right. We enjoyed the pretzel rolls with our entrees of schnitzel and rouladen, just authentic German food. The inside decor was fitting, not overdone but comfortable and spot on. The service was attentive and friendly. As out of town visitors we were very pleased to find the Waldhorn, and plan to visit again.	1
Great food, but still miss the German restaurant in hickory. We will be back for sure. Very nice place. Loved the carpaccio, a must have,	1
Best authentic German restaurant around! I go there for lunch and dinner. They always have good specials that normally aren't on the menu. Be sure to join their Beer Club, and definitely check out the annual Oktoberfest.	1
Unreal German food in a decent environment with excellent service!\nI also love the plethora of German beer. It is sooooo good! I had the Rindsrouladen...\nBraised Beef Rouladen stuffed with bacon, onions and pickle. It was delicous in every way.The side items were Sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage... also excellent.\nA pleasant surprise was the house salad. Ridiculously good. Fresh mixed greens. Perfect amount of dressing. and underneath in four little piles were surprises of carrot, pasta, cabbage, and another Item I have forgotten. All delicious little piles. Like gifts!\nOh, and I almost forgot the BREAD! Good God! The pretzel rolls with a little butter are otherworldly. I want to come back here so bad ... but living in KC it is going to be a while.	1
Not our first visit and not our last. Great quality German food and beers. Spatzle red cabbage and schnitzels galore. I like the wurst platte and the wife loves Jagerschnitzel. Portions are not quite big enough to split unless you load up on soups and the fabulous pretzel bread.	1
FREE 60-Day Membership - WARNING.  I got a coupon for a Free 60 day Membership from a Valpak mailing to my house.  My wife had me go there to claim the membership and get some Milk.  BJ's Customer Service informed me that I would have to buy a $40 dollar one year membership that I could get a refund up to one year.  They basically give you the first 60 days free, then 12 additional months for $40, then $50 the next year after that.  They should just state.  The first 14 months are refundable if you decide to cancel.  Seemed a bit complicated to me.  Is this actually a promotion?  It is definitely not 60 days FREE with no questioned asked.	0
Slowest deli department in town. They have no sense of time so you know they don't value you yours. If they are attempting to push you to buy pre-packaged this is a novel and effective way to do so, by delivering the slowest and most impersonal service EVER! Fail BJ's	0
Never heard of BJ's until I received a free 60 day membership in the mail.  After visiting this store, I know realize why they send FREE memberships.  I found it extremely off-putting to be greeted by the smell of old food at the entrance.  It has a gloomy atmosphere and is relatively small. \n\nI was unable to justify spending $50 or $100 for their membership.  Especially, since I didn't see any significant savings on the items that I would be interested in purchasing (paper & cleaning products).   I do think it is cool that they accept coupons and all forms of payment.  \n\nUltimately,  BJ's is too grimy, smelly and disheveled looking for me.  It is definitely Costco's distant, twice removed cousin.	0
Now I love red lobster but this particular location pissssssed me off!!! It was packed as usual so the food took extra long. the waitress screwed up my bill at the end of the meal, when they seated us it looked like the booth had not been properly cleaned, and the bathroom was just the nastiest bathroom in America. Like i said i understand it was busy but that is no excuse for how gross the bathroom was. i almost threw up from the smell and you could just tell that it probably had not been cleaned all day. I believe when you are an establishment with meals over $10 your bathroom should be spotless. This is something you would expect from burger king or somewhere, not red lobster. I know red lobster is not a 5 star restaurant but come on.	0
Lunch today!!  Wood fired shrimp shewers. wild rich pilaf and brocolli.  Wonderful and Service was friendly and attentive!!  Will difinitely be back!! cheese biscuits appetizers were good too!  Got busy while we were there, Restaurant was clean.	1
Great food and service. Very happy with my visit.	1
I have been to many red lobsters before and usually enjoy the food. This was the first one that we have had to wait for a seat, although it was not to long. This place seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. The food was not prepared well. The shell of the crab legs were spongy and bent with the crackers. The baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre. I will not be back to this location	0
This has only been my 2nd time at a Red Lobster EVER. It was ok. I have had better seafood elsewhere. The biscuits were by far the star of the show. \n\nWe were seated quickly for a Friday night and the server was fine.\n\nThe seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE butter but  sometimes too much of a good thing can ruin a meal. The shrimp were TINY and the Lobster Tail was TINY\n\nIt was pricey too considering we had 2 Childrens Entr\u00e9es. The kids mac and cheese was Kraft. Sort of a joke really. $5,99 for Mac and Cheese from a box. When are restaurants going to get a clue and offer more than chicken fingers and mac and cheese on the kids menu? Some kids do have an adventurous spirit and will eat real food.\n\nI may go back for a lunch and their biscuits but will probably pass on them for dinner.	0
Red lobster was not the place to be tonight. Saturday-8/11!!!! The service was horrible. The waiter messed up so bad that we had more free food then we ordered. The appetizer came out after the salad. It seem to be over before it started. It only went down hill from here. I am done with this location. Come on red lobster!!!	0
Food is always really good! Although the service is not all that. First time we went we had a server who was in training and of course we understood if she would make mistakes. Although our second time, the server was slow and did not communicate well. We rarely had refills and was slow to give is our checks and run our cards. Even though it was not very busy. Food is great, service not so much.	1
Terribly ran! We will never be back to this location. Food takes forever and it doesn't come out right. The wait staff is slow and management has no clue.	0
WhAt. A  disapointment......we ordered a salmon plate , my daughter a sirloin and wifey ordered. A shrimp kabobs, we got our drinks at 155 then about 245 we got our plates,food was barely warm, server was alright, though	0
"will never go here again b/c for the 3rd time they messed up my to go order. they offered me a gift card one time but never got it. they tried to \""apoligize\"" but it was half harted in the apology. they claimed when i was there that all my order was in the bag and when i got home to check it was not. I will never got there again. they are to serve the customers and they are doing a poor job in doing that. they really don't care about the customers and they need to have the check in hand when they are putting the orders together."	0
The lobster tail was salty. The crab legs were alright. The shrimp was awesome. The asparagus was amazing. All in all it was eh.	0
The parking lot is dark and scary.  There were rusty carts strewn about.  Boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store.  I went twice in the past week and they had one register open with four other people doing nothing both times.  First cashier wasn't friendly but the most recent one was.  The prices were okay.  I had a Groupon for the first visit and 15% off for the second.  The store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care.	0
I have been in this place several times and have had mixed experience. The service here is not so great. I had a question about a video game for my nephew and I felt like I was putting the clerk off by asking questions. The store was a bit disorganized, but I would expect that for a Saturday afternoon.	0
Not too crazy about this place. I ordered a pastrami on rye and it was just a pile of meat on soggy bread.	0
Jason's Deli on Centrum Parkway is always busy at lunch.  I have always eaten at their salad bar, which is actually quite tiny.  For a salad buffet, Souper Salad offers significantly more salad toppings and additional buffet options at a similar price.  I feel like I never get my money's worth at Jason's, though the salads there are tasty and nutritious.	0
"Huge disappointment.\n\nI wanted a real deli sandwich (not Subway).  I thought I'd give this place a try.  $10.00 got me a 6\"" meatball sub on a white bun, Lay's potato chips, and a pickle spear, with a regular soda.  The sub was not one bit better than Subway.  This was a complete waste of my time and money.  I could have had the same exact thing (sans the pickle), and chosen my own chips from a variety.  \nThey have a lot of food on the menu; I have no idea how the soups, salads, etc. are.  All I know is that I couldn't even find a list of the types of bread they offer on the menu.  This place is hard to navigate, and the food quality is not worth the trouble.\n\nUPDATE:  Went back for lunch (at a friend's request) on Tuesday (11/1).  I had the chicken club salad and a cup of the Southwestern Chicken Chili.  Both were quite good.  My bill:  $14.90.  I'll up the rating to 2 stars, as the food is OK (not great), but it is WAY overpriced."	0
The food is excellent.  The service is average and the place is over priced.  BUT THE FOOD IS GGGGGGGRRRRREEEEEEEAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTT	1
What a wonderful experience!  I am so impressed by this place and I'm mad at myself it took me this long to come.  They have a very large selection of sandwiches and a large salad bar.  My favorite part is getting the half sandwich (any on the menu) and half salad (which is large enough to put your head in).  There are complimentary muffins on the dessert bar and free ice cream too.  Everything is fresh and/or organic.  I'll go any chance I'm over this way.	1
The restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly.  But, the food was just okay the corn beef was sliced too thick and it was tough.	0
This is one of the most accommodating places I have ever had the pleasure of dining.  The staff is fantastic... I come with my two dogs and sit outside on the patio and everyone is always checking on us, offering water right when I get there for my babies and the food is so fresh and delicious.	1
Went here to get 4 tires and they were extremely quick! Within one hour, they quoted me (a great price) and had the tires installed. Was surprised that they came in lower than other competitors, so definitely check them out.	1
I went to the Vein Center for a hair removal treatment. I was greeted on time. The procedure took 10 mins - in and out. Clean, nice staff. Beware though if you are more than 5 minutes late, they will turn you away.	1
"My daughter was 7 months old and she has severe eczema she's been screaming and crying for hours and scratching her herself nonstop it's a bloody mess. One of the nurse was being kinda rude because I overheard the word morphine I called my husband to make sure that they are not giving my baby morphine. He asked to speak to the doctor I asked the nurse if she could speak to him she basically just brush me off saying \""I don't have time to talk to him \"" they got an IV on her and were about to give her doses of Benadryl,Antibiotic and Morphine !!! Both me and my husband strongly disagree because she's a little baby and just because she is screaming her lungs out and has severe skin flares ups does not mean she needs morphine!!!! We were transfer to Levine and the doctor there was also shocked when we told him they were gonna give her morphine."	0
"Terrible treatment.  If you have an emergency do NOT come here.  They have the worst unprofessional staff that is completely unorganized, no sense of urgency, and spend most of their time eating and chatting in the hall.  You will waste 3 hours in the ER bleeding from a head injury and concussion as others keep gerring treatment.  One nurse said \""oh we keep forgetting about you\""  WTF!   Go here to die!"	0
"This location has awful reviews on Google. Just awful... I was nervous going in but I received better service here than at the one across town by Northlake. David's normally doesn't carry anything in my size but the ladies here heard me out and understood that I had spoken to the bride and had gotten the okay to get a dress other than the one she had registered us for. \n\nI really appreciate that none of them suggested that I \""eat more\"" or buy a dress that is too large and get it cut down - as though either of those are viable options. \n\nThey took really good care of me, I was in & out in about half an hour. This includes trying the dress i wanted in the smallest size they had on hand (2) and having their alterations lady drop what she was doing and come pin me up to confirm that it was indeed too big. \n\nAnd I didn't have to fight traffic. Win."	1
I ordered a pair of shoes with a saleslady at this location.  She was super friendly and professional.  When I went pin to pick up the shoes another super friendly staff member was there to help me! I left feeling very happy and excited for my wedding.  I should have gone here and not Northlake to buy my dress! !!	1
Today 6/2/14 I made a appointment to get fitted for a bridesmaid dress. The minute I walked in the staff was super nice. Samantha G. helped me find the exact dress I needed!!	1
"Lenscrafters...the standard in \""while you wait\"" glasses, almost exclusively located in malls around the country.  My boyfriend had been wearing glasses taped together on the sides for oh, about 9 months now, so I decided to make him an appointment for new specs.  We were in and out in a matter of two hours, counting the wait time for his new glasses to be made.  The staff were knowledgable and friendly, without being pushy or trying to force him into choosing something he didn't like because they are \""trendy\"" (it's happened to us before!)  They were also running a special, so we got $100 off the frames and lenses, which really helps when your insurance only covers the exam.  All in all, a great experience.  We will be back when I need contacts! :)"	1
I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing. I honestly don't know how they are able to stay in business if they don't help customers or at least ask.	0
There is no doubt that the ambiance is better than many other optical's shops but the prices are very high. \n\nWe saw the same product in Carolina's mall in sears Optical's at a way lower price point. I am definitely disappointed.	0
"I wouldn't even give them one star at this location!! Beware Dr. Jeffrey Musler and Associates optometry group PA!!! This was the worst service and experience I have ever received!!! The ladies at the reception desk are horrible!!!! I called to order contacts and they were utterly confused. Miscommunication across the board. The receptionist said \""maybe\"" they'll go ahead and service me and they might call me back and hung up on me! I was simply trying to order contacts as the doctor told me it would be easy as calling in to do so. Terrible place and I would not recommend this facility to anyone."	0
Booooo	0
Be careful when shopping here !  Bought an $8,000+ bed.  Delivered broken !  Are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery.  More interested in sales than checking their product.  Poor attention to detail, poor quality.  When selling expensive products ladies and gentlemen, you need to make sure the product is not broken before delivering - check it in the warehouse - rather simple if you really care. No excuse for discovering a broken product in front of a customer.  Buyer beware with these folks.	0
My husband and I ate at Buca di Beppo for lunch today for the first time.  Neither of us were impressed.  The staff was slow and somewhat unresponsive (even though it wasn't busy in the least), the food was subpar and the prices were too high for what we received. \n\nI would not return!	0
We haven't been here in over a year and it was time to return and see if there was any changes. First, the decor is still cool...lots of pictures, statues, albums on the wall. We were greeted by everybody working there ---very nice. Ordered the apple Gorgonzola salad. It came out wrong and had to be reordered. This is a really wonderful salad....Unfortuately it took 15 Min's to get it the second time. Their bread used to be wonderful too.....hot and fresh full of flavor now it's just plain old french bread tasteless. \nOur entree of lasagna came out on a very hot plate but was cold but burnt on the bottom. Manager came to the rescue and immediately took care of the problem. I liked the idea of having the chef bring out the correct entree since it was his fault and not the waiter. \nWould I go back? Probably not, too many good Italian restaurants in the area that are better	0
"12/26/11 7:45pm.\nI go to the hostess station and request seating for one.  Hostess asks if i wish to be seated at the bar, and I politely declined.  She then said \""we are not taking any more walk in business tonight.\""  \n\nI have a suggestion on where this place can shove a few of their meatballs."	0
"Two and a half stars, neither A-ok nor real bad. \nI was at Carolina Place around 1:30 pm and decided to give this restaurant a try -I was told it's the best Eyetalian in Charlotte.\n\nFirst the good part: I ordered the baked rigatoni with meat sauce and hot Italian sausage. It was excellent -if like me you like strong flavors and spicy both- nothing I'd expect from a chain restaurant. The lunch portion was huge, too much in fact.\nthat's it for the good.\n\nService was absolutely dismal for no good reason. It was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch. I think the dinner prices are very high for Southern Italian style pasta dishes, especially considering we're in Charlotte and I think their idea of \""family dining\"" makes life easier for the cook but does nothing for the customer. \n\nMy idea of fun dining is exactly the opposite, I want to taste as many different things I can, not pig out on a mound of carbs."	0
"The food here is okay (2.5 stars)and does not completely satisify your appetite. Every time we have eaten here, we were hungry shortly after. Go figure. Well, the service here on the times we have visited has never knocked our socks off. Just okay. Very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy. It is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food. The garlic knots and calamari are consistently tasty. Not a place we want to run to on a regular, but good enough for a \""snack\""."	0
"...called at 6p to see if they would take reservations for that night. yes, but not 7p... 7:15p is open. Cool, table for 4 at 7:15 it is. We arrived at 7:10 and were told we will call your name when a table is ready... at 7:25 I asked if our 7:15 reservation was ready yet and she said we are a little behind. There are a few still ahead of you... Our name was called at 7:46 after 4 tables of 4 and a table of 6 were seated. \nAnyone can take a reservation... Its the holding of the reservation that counts right? (UNHAPPY)\n The food was OK, a small salad for the table, 2 shared dinners for 4, a side of pasta with a meatball & 1, $12 bottle of wine and 2 deserts nothing worth going out of your way for at a cost of almost $150.00. There was also 5 or 6 \""birthday/clapping\"" sessions around us like at Applebees.\nThe wait staff was nice, quick and good looking, but I'd rather have a slow, ugly waiter with good food myself.\nNo hurry to go back there... ever."	0
Came for Thanksgiving thought it would be nice for a change boy was I wrong made reservations 2 weeks ahead of time was supposed to get kitchen table didn't get it ! Then went to order gnocchi waiter brand new says they don't have ordered a Guinness beer says we have it be right back comes back like 15 minutes later to tell me they don't have.this place used to be good boy did it go down hill ! So disappointed !	0
Originally left a bad reviw. Bur since then I was contacted by the district manager. You really seem to care about this restaurant's reputation. He said they're making improvements and that I should try it again. I told him I would and I will hold my review until I do that again. Everybody deserves a second chance.	0
My niece selected Buca for her birthday meal, so we were happy to take her. We took the tour through the kitchen on the way to our table, nice touch. Our waitress was super friendly and willing to answers our questions patiently.\n\nFamily style dining is fun, probably more so with a larger group to share with. We ordered a side dish of Alfredo for our niece because she couldn't eat a whole dish alone and neither my husband or I care for Alfredo ourselves. We decided to share the Quattro al Forno with ravioli, canneloni, manicotti and stuffed shells. We ordered a small, which states it is for 2-3 people to share. Hmm. Not sure I am buying that. It was a pretty small portion in my opinion for the money and the price. It was good, but not great. Chicken canneloni was my favorite.  The hubby ordered a meatball on the side and while it was big, he said it lacked the ooomph he was hoping for. Bummer.\n\nWe would go back with a group, but probably not on our own. I rounded up a 3.5 trip due to the great staff and eclectic atmosphere.	1
"They had 3 hostess up front doing nothing and didn't even greet us. Booked reservation for 17 and she tried to cram us on 3 tables. We had no space to move elbows. Why would you even try to seat us like that? Reason I book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time. \n\nWhen I walk up front ask host if I can get a bigger table. She gave me an attitude. And was like \""sure\"". Never got a apology for cramming us into a small table. The place is a family style with big dishes. The way they had us seated we wouldn't been able too move to grab our food. Terrible customer service and it was my birthday. Disappointment. Will never return to the restaurant."	0
Love this place! Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Mmm table bread, Mountain Dew, & Caesar Salads!!	1
If the idea of awkwardly taking a tour of the kitchen followed by a maze through overrated Italian singers only to be led to a picnic table of the worst food ever... You are in for a good time.  DISGUSTING! Worst Italian food ever! They shouldn't even call it Italian food. It tastes like a frozen lean cuisine. The bread was even bad. Overpriced! Don't waste your time and money going here. \n\nThis place really should receive a total of negative stars but yelp wouldn't let us post.   Sad	0
I was less than impressed. The meatballs were greasy and very bland. The price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive. Based on the reviews I was excited to try, but I will stick to Olive Garden or even Stouffers lasagna.	0
"Seriously, how many F words can you not use on a Yelp review? How do you order app, a salad and three entrees.  Salad came first then bruschetta (wtf) toast and tomatoes and cheese.  Don't give it a sweet name and take 50 minutes to make it.  Also the fact that we order lasagna and you are out of it?  You couldn't tell me that during the 50 mins that you were making bruschetta?  How long does it take to make lasagna?  Wait someone told me longer I'm sorry I didn't go to culinary school, I guess nether did your cooks \""I use cooks loosely\"".\nI would recommend a better Italian place but I'm Scottish, I would say stay home drink beer and make macaroni and cheese!"	0
Excellent southern Italian style dishes. Food is served family style so a small portion will feed two people. Avoid anything made with aioli as they do not do a good job with this.	1
Went there on 10/22/14. Service was nice. Server was nice but so ditsy. Ordered bruschetta. Came out fast, but entr\u00e9e's came out 50 mins later. Ordered eggplant parmigiana. Tasted burned. Waitress took my credit card and we waited almost 10 minutes for our credit card slip and she was so unorganized.	0
The food here is subpar, at best. When we asked for a kids cheese pizza, they basically smeared some tomato sauce on a tortilla, sprinkled a few strings of shredded cheese on it and, with the way the cheese barely looked melted, I'd estimate they'd popped it in the microwave for maybe 30 seconds. It's a shame the food is so bad though because the decor is fantastic and, getting to take a tour of the kitchen before you eat is something you definitely don't experience everywhere. At least you know that, even if the final dish doesn't taste that great, it came from a clean kitchen.	0
Went in for the Thanksgiving Day meal that they offer.  They indicate the two options are for 3 or 6 people.  We had 4 so chose the the meal that feeds 6 to take back leftovers.  Unfortunately they provided for for 4 people, even only brought out 4 pieces of pie for desert.  After getting about one spoon of dressing we asked for extra and were charged for it!  We ordered a bottle of wine when ordering the food that did not arrive until we were half way done eating.  Service wasn't that great either, had to ask for things twice before getting the.\n\nNeedless to say, after ordering and paying for a dinner that is supposed to feed 6, we brought nothing home.  It was my parents, uncle and myself, not exactly a group that should go through a Thanksgiving meal that is supposed to feed 6.\n\nThis place may be worth the money for the regular menu (never been there for that though) but felt cheated on this TG meal.	0
I love Bi-Lo Butts......Pork Butts that is, just for my own Famous BBQ.\n\nI am not a big fan of Bi-Lo, but when it comes to friends and family wanting the absolute best BBQ, it must come from here.....\n\nHere's why:\nThey offer the correct sizes needed to feed a small army, with just the right amount of fat content to slow cook this bad butt into a wonderful piece of food art.\n\nBi-Lo prices are much better than the competitors and seem to offer this piece of meat on specials a little more frequently than others.\n\nThe service is friendly, but again, I only shop here for the butts.\n\nI find that they do offer a good variety of meats and other goods, but the butts are hands down the best value.  They do offer a butcher on site if needed for any choice cuts you may need.\n\nNCFoodGuy	1
Unless you have no other choice do not shop here.  The store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then Harris Teeter.  If you come after 10 you can hang out with the manager smoking outside (That's where he always is) or you can buy out of date bakery products.  If you question my review take a moment to go visit the men's bathroom.  It is disgusting and can be smelled 10 feet before you even get to the door.	0
Close by grocery store ... Open 24 hrs - but count on it ... But not dependable for the real groceries... Go to Harris Teeter or Trader Joes for that ... This is good for creamer or milk or eggs ... Maybe ...	0
Close by grocery store ... Open 24 hrs - but count on it ... If you have a need for something specific - there's a good chance they will be out of it or have discontinued carrying it ... This place is not dependable for the real groceries... Go to Harris Teeter or Trader Joes for that ... This is good for creamer or milk or eggs ... Maybe ...  Also watch the cashiers - famous for over charges and not giving credit for coupons even after they're mentioned to them ... Most definitely pay attention to your charges !	0
I wanted to bring some snacks back to Canada with me that we can't there. K-mart wouldn't be my first choice, but it was right across the street from my hotel so convenience was the factor here. The store wasn't busy, yet it didn't seem to be in the most organized state. Overall, the look of the store just seems to be tired.\n\nThe cashiers were friendly, but other than a couple of employees stocking shelves the store seemed to be a bit of a ghost town.	0
Seriously I waited in the drive thru for like 10 minutes. Finally I actually called the store and asked if there was a problem. The manager was like no why? So I explained that we had all been sitting there for forever and I was trapped in the drive thru and couldn't get out and could he please start taking orders. His response was oh sorry I accidentally turned my headset off go ahead with your order. (I was 3 cars away).  Anyways I got my usual cantina bowl and it was okay... not great even by Taco Bell standards.	0
I'm stuck between TWO and THREE stars. After all it is Taco Bell. \n\nYou can usually count on them for cheap and fast food. The cheap part is always standard. But, the fast part for this location has struggled for a while. I mainly visit this location for weekday work time lunch breaks (12 or 1 pm.)\n\nMaybe I should give them some slack because most places are slammed around this same time, but I feel they could step it up a bit and decrease the wait time a little.\n\nAlthough, I do really have zero complaints on the food. After all it is Taco Bell.	0
Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive (menu on-line)\n\nIt was clean and the service was good but, the food was medicore at best. If you can't have a great cheeseburger at a steak house then you have problems.	0
Maybe I'm spoiled by the Longhorn near my house, which is always good...\n\nWhen I arrived at 7:30pm on a Sunday evening, I was treated as if the restaurant was about to close.  The hostess was very short with me and my date.  She walked us to a table, dropped the menus, and walked away.\n\nThe server (never told us his name) came by the table and got our drink order.  No personality and didn't make us feel welcome.  We ordered eventually.  No personality, still.  (Are they closing soon?)\n\nDinner arrived and my steak didn't taste right.  My date didn't like her steak either.  The manager came by and offered next to nothing to make things right.  I eventually requested some A1 and dowsed my steak in that.\n\nThe best part of dinner was the sweet tea.	0
"C'mon folks, w/all the great places to get a steak in the Charlotte area, from Longhorn pricing to high dollar steaks elsewhere, why is ANYONE going to Longhorn??...its never been more than an \""OK\"" steakhouse at its best, and that locations glory days, so to speak, have been in its rearview mirror for probably 5+ years....."	0
i used to work at this location in high school - back then it was great food and a fun atmosphere. Things have really slipped since then though. They drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese....  I thought it was supposed to be a healthy dish (?)....\nMy sweet tea wasn't sweet at all, which was UBER disappointing for me because I hadn't had sweet tea in 8 months because I moved up north...\nMy soup was alright - French Onion - pretty standard. \nMy friend enjoyed his meal though so that was cool. But he wanted to satisfy a sweet tooth after his lunch and the server never suggested desert. He suggested everything else that we ddin't want but I guess he just gave up and figured we wouldn't want it anyway. \nNothing great and I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again...	0
We like Longhorn, but not this location.  The service here is mediocre at best.  Tonight it took 10 minutes to order drinkes at the bar, 10 more minutes to get them and 10 minutes when we had to pay to go to our table.  When we go to the table, it was not ready for us to sit and we had to wait until cleanup was finished. When we eventually got the appetizer the bread, there were no plates around.  10 more minutes to get plates.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, there was only a passing similarity between the menu pictures and what we received. My Caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland.\n\nWorst experience in a long time.	0
"Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! \nGot to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!\nAfter waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded \""two of us, but is there a wait??\"" She responds, \""yes at least 10-15 minutes\"".\nAt this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. \n\nNeedless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business."	0
Don't let a good place down.  Longhorn consistently provides a good value and great food.\n\nI had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here, it's near the BestBuy in a mall area.  Classic exterior and very nice interior with a comfortable bar area and large dining areas, which would be great for a company function or family dinner.\n\nPersonally I like their Salmon and Sierra Chicken meals more than their steaks, but when I have had a steak it is top quality.  I think their grilled chicken is the best anywhere.  Choices of sides and a salad for a reasonable price.\n\nDefinitely will be returning to this location.	1
Great steaks for the price. Always good service. Don't get me wrong, they aren't the greatest steak place. But the best in the affordable/causal range.	1
This used to be my favorite steak house in Charlotte.  It's really gone downhill lately.  The last 2 times I've eaten here the prime rib was still cold.  I told the waiter to take it back and cook it some more.  He brought it back STILL COLD.  I realize prime rib is best rare, but this guy just didn't get it.  Nice waitresses and free peanuts though.	0
Love this place. Eat here once a week. Great food staff and the place is clean. 5 star because there is nothing negative that you can say.	1
The meal was good.  The usual, chain steakhouse quality. ... except the 18 oz rib eye came with a 5 oz bone in it.....Typically the servers are at least attentive at the longhorn.  Today our server would have preferred she didn't have people to wait on.  The restaurant wasn't busy but getting a new drink was almost impossible....and you better be satisfied with the old mug cause getting a new frosty mug with the 2nd beer was not going to happen.	0
They get two for the great service but everything else was not so good. I had a ribeye which was cooked to the right temperature. It was seasoned with a TON of salt and a pound of butter. Sweet potato also had too much butter. My gf got the lobster chops the lobster was overcooked and tough to get out of the shell. It should be easy when it comes split already right? Her corn on the cob was undercooked. So all in all the service is good but the food sucks. We will not be coming back again.	0
Consistency is what I like about Long Horn. Still the best place for a steak under $25 anywhere. Even their sirloins are great and you can mostly cut with a fork. The Filets you can always cut with a fork.  A dash of salt and pepper is all I ever need to put on their steaks.\n\nThe salads at Long Horn, this is where they need to step up their game. Let's do something other than ice berg lettuce guys!	1
We got here a little before 5 PM hoping to beat the crowd and not have to wait to be seated-The place was empty except for the 5 or 6 parties ahead of us in the waiting area who made the same mistake-We were expected to happily wait until 5 when more servers would start work-We left.Don't pretend to be open and not be ready to serve hungry customers!I like the food here and think it's a pretty good value for the $60 or so we spend for the two of us,but there's lots of other places to spend that money-	0
Service was still excellent, I ordered the outlaw ribeye my gf ordered the salmon. Both were cooked perfect and my steak was seasoned perfect. Thank you to the staff for giving us the gift card. We will deffinetly be back in the future. It must have been an off night before.	1
The meal was Filet, with asparagus and salad though right now I am not eating oil of any kind so the salad was not an option - I opted for the grilled shrimp instead ... Steak was delicious - the asparagus was cooked to death and worn out and the grilled shrimp was good though the manager wanted no part of offering any consideration of discount for the salad I didn't order ... \nLong story short - go to Outback Steakhouse right around the corner and get treated remarkable and get food you want with no hassles mate ! \nWon't make this mistake again - too many choices in Charlotte to have to dicker over $6.00 !  Outback would not only have accommodated my request but would have checked to make sure I was happy ... \nLonghorn was NOT crowded - hum. ... Probably why ... Carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !	0
very nice store. the selections are fairly good for all types of animals. they at ban field vets have a traveling aviary doctor which was a little inconvenient seeing as I needed one that day.\nthe bird toys are slim for large birds. the bird foods and treats selections is very good. I like the dog treat section also they have a much better variety than the average grocery store or wal mart. one of my dogs is a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs 3lbs she is no bigger than a can of soda with legs and has very few teeth. the training rewards treats are perfect for her tiny mouth and soft enough for her to chew.\n\nI have walked around the store some and all areas have a good variety to choose from no matter what you are looking for.\n I love that I can take my animals in the store. the staff has always been very attentive and friendly	1
Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse.	0
Closed for business	0
After seeing myriad commercials and advertisements everywhere for the new JCP, I decided to pay them a visit.  It has been many, many, many years since I have even set foot in JCP.  I had not even given them a thought.  However, it is a new year and times have changed.  My visit netted quite a few items for my girls, not so much for myself.  Shopping on a Friday evening after work is, in fact, hard work.  The staff members were very nice and all of them greeted me cheerfully.\n\nI ended up shopping online and found a couple items that I am quite pleased with.  I will say that many items were out of stock online; this is a clear indication that JCP has ramped up their merchandise quality and many haven taken notice and are reaping the benefits.  Shop JCP online to take your time viewing the merchandise.  If you are up to it, shop the store.  The 1st and 3rd Friday sales are on limited items that are on clearance.	1
I used the ship to store feature on the website to get free shipping since the mall is really close to my house. It was quick and easy, and definitely better than trying to fight people for product in the store. \n\nI didn't quite understand where I could pick up my order, so since it was shoes I walked to that section to ask. The girl at the front was really friendly and she called up to the receiving department who brought down my shoes. I checked to see that 1. it was the correct shoe and 2. that they were the correct size. Both were true, so she printed me a receipt, and I signed that I received the merchandise, then I was on my way! \n\nVery pleasant experience and definitely worth it to save $8.	1
Waiting in line no one here....3 employees standing around and no one says anything. Horrible service. Next time ill just order on amazon	0
I came here for the first time and was so happy they could customize my bagel to be healthy by making it skinny (cutting a chunk out of the middle making it thinner) and using egg whites.  It was warm, fresh and tasty.\n\nNext I thought I would try one of their Green Mountain coffees - the Island Coconut flavor.  I know what your thinking but stop right there .... give it a whirl.  Wow it is good!  I got so excited about it I craved it for a whole week.\n\nIts such a nice change to a greasy fried breakfast.  I'm glad I went and I will be back!	1
"Cream cheese skimp alert!! We pay ~$7 per smoked salmon bagel and they put the cream cheese on like people butter their toast. They have no clue what the word \""toasted\"" means. It really is just warming the bagel. The lox bagels are not even made open face. Not going back again."	0
Great value. I think this will become a regular place for me. Rebecca was great! I loved the long massage, and paraffin wax treatment, which I never got in any swanky Ballantyne/Southpark basic pedi that costs $20 more. The place is not fancy, but their service is outstanding. My one small complaint was that the chair was well-used and maybe not the most comfortable, but the massage feature worked just fine!	1
BEST NAIL EXPERIENCE EVER!!! With nail salons, I usually experience friendly, but not great work or excellent work and not too friendly or a little bit of both , but not a great atmosphere! This encompassed all 3! The paraffin (no extra charge), large massage chair, very attentive and detailed pedicure, affordable pricing  and the exceptionally friendly service made the experience 5 stars! This will be the only salon I use for for mani, pedi and waxing. A little bit hard to find (across from Carolina place mall on 51, in the K-mart/Best Buy strip mall).. GO NOW!	1
My toes look GREAT, the staff is super nice! This is my first visit....I decided to join my friend (it's her Birthday) Personally I only visit nail salons that use Tub liners, which this place doesn't....so my search will continue.	1
Not the best or the worst mall in Charlotte. I'm the in and out type of guy - go straight to correct store, shop and get back to car/drive back home. In that perspective, Carolina Mall works.\n\nFor a fuller mall feel, I Concord Mills Mall and others better than this one.	0
I love this mall!!\n\nIt's not overwhelming and always packed like Concord Mills and it has stores that everyone can shop in...like Belk and JC Penny's all of my other favorites stores like Bath and Body Works, NY and Company, Express...the list goes on and on...It's always clean and I rarely have trouble finding parking. Right off the highway which is a huge plus in my book but another reason this mall is so great is the location... it's surrounded by really good restaurants, like Harpers, Red Lobster, Olive Garden.\n\nI'm really a fan and I would recommend my friends and family to this mall.	1
My favorite mall in the Queen City area. It has a down to earth vibe to it. A great mall because it's really never packed.	1
ALERT TO PARENTS AND SHOPPERS OF CAROLINA PLACE MALL:  One of the employees of the massage parlor (Oasis) next to the kid's play area was caught inconspicuously taking pictures of my 4 yr. old daughter while she was playing there.  Even though it is private property, the General Manager of the Carolina Place will not ban him from working at the mall because it is not against the law to take pictures of little girls.  The police report number is 121005-2147.	0
Santa Claus here sucks!  They wouldn't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down.  They just shooed us along and wouldn't even try to help calm our kid down.  \n\nHow disappointing it is that these people are charging an arm and leg for these pictures but will not even attempt to settle a child down or get them acclimated to a stranger with a long beard! \n\n\nI will not be back to see year people again!\n\nI	0
Gave this mall yet another try again today, disappointed again.  Easily second fiddle to any other mall in the area.  All the regular stores, plus some of the more trashy ones.  And watch out for the security nazis, same jerk came by twice in 6 min to tell my 3 kids to calm down, and we were outside the mall!?!  I figured outside was the best place for my kids to run & play while we waited for the stores to open.  Will continue to go to SouthPark of all my mall needs.	0
Love shopping at this mall.... Very affordable especially during the holiday season! Just be careful shopping on the weekends! It can get VERY crazy!!!!!	1
My intention was to get back to Sweet Tea's today, but they are closed on Sundays. So, being in that area, my Mother wanted the Chinese Chicken Salad at Applebee's, one of her all time favorites. Not being a true fan of chains, I agreed. And, I was very impressed. I ordered a cheeseburger w/ fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and fresh! I also really enjoyed their seasoned fries. My Mom enjoyed her salad as well, and the staff was attentive throughout the entire meal. Shocked, yes, but happy I said yes.	1
I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink ... not so bad. If you're coming to eat ...  ah you might think again!	0
"Had great service until we got our food. Took one bit into my pasta and a brillo pad was on my fork!!!! I was disgusted. I asked to speck to the manger and she told me \"" it's acceptable for these kinds of things to happen in restaurants\"". I will not be going to any restaurant if Brillo pads are going To end up in my food. Yes I know sometimes things could land I'm my food. I.e hair but a Brillo pad is something that can't go unseen. \nI contacted Applebee's human resources and they were great. No complaints there, very friendly and easy to work with, called back was very impressed."	0
Absolutely the worst customer service of any retail store I've ever experienced. No matter what city/state, it never fails.	0
"I don't know of any other jeweler with a loyalty or marketing program like Helzberg. My husband bought me a ring for graduation a couple years ago and some jewelry on special occasions from Helzberg. Since those purchases, his name has been on their list and for our anniversary and my birthday, they have sent us cards with a free gift (have to go to store to pick up). Talk about speaking my love language! This is definitely a relationship with benefits!\n\nWe've been into this particular location a few times and each time we have been met by friendly sales associates. They haven't ever pressured us to buy anything and believe me I have been known to \""window shop\"" the jewelry cases planning my next big purchase. \n\nI've purchased other significant pieces of jewelry (e.g., husband's wedding band) at other high end jewelers and I've never received a card from them...they should take note of Helzberg and follow suit. Definitely when it comes to customer service and above-and-beyond satisfaction, Helzberg has it down!"	1
I was very unimpressed with this Olive Garden location.  The service was subpar- I sat at the bar and the bartender was far more interested in talking to coworkers than the few patrons at the bar.\n\nSecondly, the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company. The Zuppa Toscana was devoid of the spiciness that makes the soup as well as full of fatty sausage.\n\nI also ordered the Ravioli di Portobello, it came out stone cold, unacceptable for a baked entree. I sent it back and the second time it came out it was just as cold. I finally spoke to a manager who comp'd my meal. I will never be back to this location.	0
I've been to a number of Olive Gardens across the country and this one by far has me most unimpressed of all. \n\nOur server, Derek A. (tall, bald guy), was hopeless to say the least. He didn't mention any specials, didn't get us our drink refills in time and never offered any additional bread sticks or salad. Finally waited forever to ask for a to-go box and our check, only to hear him whine to another person right behind us about how he can't seem to catch a break and how he can't even pronounce my name. Ahem, ok, but don't say it right in front of the customer?? :)\n\nFood portions were great and entrees were yummy, but breaksticks were not warm as we've come to expect from Olive Gardens. And did I mention that we didn't get any extra? :D\n\nAnyways, horrible experience. Maybe he was having an off day, but I'd suggest asking to be waited by someone else (everyone else seemed wonderful!) and I believe your server's attitude is directly proportional to your dining experience.	0
Went here becuase my in-laws wanted to try it out. Not a big fan of Olive Garden but you can't go wrong with their food. \n\nWe went on a weekend so it was busy. The table they sat us at, smelled so badly!!! I did not even want to put my purse down. The area smelled like throw up or smelly feet. This made my food experience not good. \n\nThe place is just older and needs some renovations. Please change your carpets!	0
The minute you step into this OG, you will get the stench of smelly socks. Very hard to un-notice the smell. Service was poor, the waitress was just trying to get rid of us ASAP, even though we went in at 8PM (not too late for dinner in my opinion). The place is not clean, the table we sat was sticky.\n\nFood was in par with the other OGs. Will I go there again ? nah for the amount of money I pay I would go some place else - that at the least doesnt smell.\n\nIm giving this two stars only for the food.	0
My mother wanted to take my wife and I out to dinner for my wife's B-day, we were a party of eight, we were assigned two waitresses that had a difficult time getting on the same page. Wrong order, wrong drink refills, and it took 1:49 from the time we placed our order until the food reached the table. A member of our party stated a food allergy, he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well, which took another 34 minutes, and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us, when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again, and I would suggest that you do the same. We were not the only ones with a grievance as several other \npatrons were given gift cards and comped bills.	0
Want a zero star option! I am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible! Where do I start? Got soup without bread which came about 20 mins later as it was baking every time we would remind her although everyone around was getting baskets. Then Food ordered was new promos that had no details and had to rely on waitress which was clueless! She lied about the meal all together. Ended up with 2 meals un eaten. The bread finally arrived at end and lemon never came...she kept saying it was being cut! Ended with her dropping our plate on floor causing flying glass and never got a mint! Well at least she was smart enough to ask mgr to talk to us b4 us asking!	0
Most people are aware that OG is far far from authentic...however it seems that OG has gone downhill in recent years, and has left it up to a marketing team to save them. Upon our most recent visit to this OG in Pineville, They gave me food poisoning. Having worked in the restaurant business for 15 years, I am very aware of what food poisoning is and is not. This was the real deal..my first hint should have been at the restaurant when the couple seated next us were complaining about their food. I doubt we'll ever be back.	0
Came here for lunch with my pops, who was fiending for their $6.95 soup/salad/breadsticks extravaganza. He is a huge fan of this deal, but unfortunately did NOT receive it, since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, and they only offer their lunch specials on WEEKDAYS.\n\nAnother slight issue I had was the fact that the waiter messed up my order, but the manager gladly replaced it free-of-charge for me, and gave me her humble apologies. Once I received the dish I ordered - beef medallions over fettuccine alfredo - it was actually pretty tasty. It featured green onions, chives, sauteed spinach, and tasted pretty fresh, discounting the strong vinaigrette coating on the steak. My dad would have given this place four stars, but I am not my dad!	0
I love this place because the pasta is always very very very hot.	1
Let me start off by premising the fact that I was at the mall, I knew I could sit quickly at the bar and I had a gift card since christmas or I would not be eating at a chain restaurant. It was what you expect at all of the chains. I got chicken and shrimp carbonarra (spell check). It was fair. What does one expect for something quick and convenient to what I was doing at the time.  I do wish however that I spent the gift card next door just shoveling cheddar bays down my throat. Good talk.	0
Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.\n\nWe were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.\n\nThe food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.\n\nTwo stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good.	0
It is amazing how this restaurant always has long wait times when I honesty don't believe that the food is great. I have gone a couple of times and each time that I have gone I have gotten different dishes. I feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something. You can definitely find better chain Italian restaurants like Maggiano's or Bravo! Come here if you like bland dishes.	0
This place was disgusting!!! I ate here yesterday around 6. I usually love Olive Garden but the last 2times I've been here was nasty. The outside is dirty, front entrance littered with cigarette butts. There is a stinch as soon as you open the door. The food was gross, greasy and very bad. I gave it one star because of the waiter.  I'll never go to this one ever again. The health inspector needs to visit and manager fired!!	0
"From the time we walked in to the time we left the staff was extremely friendly. The new \""small plates\"" are a great addition to an already great menu selection. Try the crispy asparagus!!! Only 2.99 to add to an entree. My wife had the steak Gorgonzola and it was cooked a perfect medium. All in all I felt like it could not have been a better dinner date night!"	1
--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! \n\nThis is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. \n\nManagement provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!	0
Smells like wet dog.  EXTREMELY humid inside.   Food was good (the two stars worth).  Service was very bad today.  I am a server myself and I would be beyond embarrassed if I provided such poor service to a table.  Added bonus - It constantly seemed like she was trying to rush us out.  Delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking!!!  Also delivered our checks before we were halfway done and we had to ask to have a desert added on...	0
I've been to this place at least four times now. (once every month) I've had good experiences all four times that I've gone. I do however go during lunch time when they aren't as busy. We also go when we get their buy one entree get one free coupon in the mail. It's an awesome deal! \n\nThey have a huge variety on both their drink and food menu. I will say that I think they have the best steaks compare to Applebee's and Chilli's. Their steaks are super tender and the server always ask you to cut your steak to make sure its cook the way you asked.	1
Been eating here for three years now, and the service is always good, as is the food. My daughter (5) loves the ribs, as do I.  Our favorite thing to eat here, though, are the Carolina Honey Bites off the appetizer menu.   I've had nothing like them, so they always hit the spot and start the meal off right.  Strongly recommend to fans of ribs.	1
Currently here at the restaurant. It's noisy, crowded, disorganized, and there are not enough waiters. In our case we got out appetizer and our entree with about a 2-3 minute seperation. They had not even cooled enough to eat them before we got the entree. We were not the only one either, the people next to us had the same thing happen with an even shorter delay. So lets move onto the entree... Two steaks both looked good on the outside. One ordered medium the other medium rare... Both are RARE beyond rare. Giant red center all the way to the edge. This place is to expensive for the level of service that they provide.\n\nSo after this bad experience why did I give a two star review instead of a one.... Because the potato skins were delicious	0
So far really slow food service . Took over half an hour to get main entree after getting the drinks and appetizer.  \n\nServer was good, but my filet medallion was off . A second filet medallion was undercooked. By this time I was done with my ribs,which were very tasty, and my sides and I asked to see the manager. The manager gave an apology and only charged for the ribs. okay, but won't be going back soon . \n\nMy Strawberry Limeade,an alcoholic beverage, was great!	0
I had been a fan of TR for years. Saturday was my first time back and I was dissapointed in the changes. The menu had changed greatly. They took away all the samplers of different ribs and the portions are much smaller. The price has gone up alot also. The ribs taste good but for the price it's just not worth me going back. I heard they were having a tough time thru the county but the changes made I don't believe will make them better.	0
I came here initially seeking Sriracha, but unfortunately, this location did not carry it. The very handsome sales associate (near the computer stuff on 8/23) with the moist blue eyes and sandy hair was incredibly helpful to my friend and me. He searched other stores for Sriracha and skillfully wrote directions for us. I've never received directions as precise as those he gave us. This sales associate was exceptional and smelled really good. I highly recommend this location for its staff (but don't go here for Sriracha).	1
You don't need fancy computer controlled cash registers and racks to get a shirt clean.  \n\nThe husband and wife team that own Starmount Cleaners work six days a week and they have not yet invested in a computerized order taking system.  Maybe that's why they always:\n\n--Remember my name\n--Remember I like medium starch\n--Return my clothes quickly \n--Do so for only $1.50 per shirt\n\nI tried a lot of the bigger cleaners, paid a lot more money and was never satisified until I found this hole in the wall cleaners.  This is one mom and pop you shouldn't miss.	1
I am all for supporting local small businesses in my communi, butafter having one of my $50 dress shirts sliced in the same two spots on each sleeve by Starmount cleaners i would never return. The owner is very rude, denied damaging my shirt and tried telling me the shirt wore out. Obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction. Further, they do their own dry cleaning in-house and do not do as good of a job as the ones who send it out. Avoid this place at all costs. If they damage or loose your items they will leave you out to dry, literally.	0
Great food. Great down-home atmosphere and friendly staff. Breakfast is wonderful and the coffee is good. Waffle house is crowded yet Corner Cafe is better all the way around.	1
Had a Breakfasts meeting last week & enjoyed a wonderful breakfast.  I imagine my cholesterol jumped, however it was delicious food.  Steak Omelet, I'm thinking imitation steak but no, also with 3 types of cheeses what could go wrong.  You would think that with that may types of cheeses it would be heavy but no just the right blend & amount cheese & steak.  Home Fries come with it and all I can say is I hope your hungry.  The portion is quite large.  I'm guessing about 1/3 of my plate was home fires.  Overall service was good and food good, price is average for a dinner type atmosphere.  Definitely will add them to my list of restaurants to revisit.	1
These guys are great!!!\nMy boyfriend took his dog here the other day and they took him without an appointment with no hassles! They did a great job and we got our baby back in a reasonable time! \nWe will be back.	1
I took my dog here to be boarded.  He came home unhappy, but I didn't think much of it (maybe he just missed us).   I used them a second time to groom my dog.  This is where the problem arose.  When I went to pick up my dog, they gave me someone elses pet.  Even though this was a chocolate lab (like mine), it was obviously not my dog.  Then they argued with me saying he was he only chocolate lab they had.  Well....one hour later and 3 other labs (I thought mine was the only one!)...they finally found my dog.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you hate your dog and want to trade him in for another model.	0
DANGER: This place is way too small to take in the number of dogs that it takes. The online viewing is deceiving and makes this place look larger than what it is. They will try to take your dog and quickly escort him/her into the play room. However, be sure to ask for a tour and see the space. I took the tour and the space is SMALL. I was there one day and they had 17 dogs in a space the size of my living room. That is dangerous! If something were to happen (ie. a fight) all of the dogs would join (pack behavior) and there would be nothing they could do to protect your pup.	0
Anything shiny grabs my attention immediately. I easily get distracted in Jared's. I went in to repair a bracelet I purchased over a year ago and I found myself lusting over case after case of jewelry.\n\nJared's offers great customer service. I purchased a couple items from one of their stores in Arizona and the location here was more than willing to help repair without charge. In both locations I've encountered very nice sales staff.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with buying me something at this store!	1
Love these guy's.  I have been taking my car there since 2008.  First time I brought my car there was for an oil change.  Told Rod at the desk I needed cv joints because another mechanic said I did.  Well, I didn't, He however told me what I needed and took me in the shop and showed me every aspect of my car and his suggestions.  I was the first feel good experience I have had at a repair shop.  Rod has since gone and Tim has taken his place and he gives me the same customer service I have grown to love.  Keep it up guys!	1
This is a review of their business practices online.  \n\nEssentially, a long time ago I started getting emails from this exact precision tune.  Someone there must have given my email as theirs, or the tech mis-typed it.  \n\nDO NOT LET THEM HAVE YOUR EMAIL.. there is no way to get off the list.  I'm now taking actions to report their mis-handling in the case they send any more emails..\n\nIf you get stuck with their emails, contact their admin by searching 'whois ptautocare.com' and getting their email.  \n\nEdit : They claim the link at the bottom will unsubscribe.  I clicked that thing many a time man... been getting emails for years from you, the Honda Dealership nearby, etc etc... FML	0
Will never go back. Was there 2 hours before closing for an oil change and was turned away because they did not have enough time.  I gladly took my business elsewhere.	0
Slow, absolutely the worst.  Horrible communication skills and customer service. I wouldn't imagine In million years how inconsiderate people in the auto business could be.	0
There's a reason no one goes here. Service is horrible. Even with only 1 other person in the store the staff acts like their overwhelmed. How this location is still in business is some type of weird paradox. Don't bother to stop. You have been warned.	0
Visit this location several times before.\nFood was fresh, prepared quickly. Service was friendly and helpful.\nDinning room...all the tables were dirty.\nFood better than the normal burger chain so understand the slightly higher price.\nWill come back	1
Ugh...don't waste your time or your money!  I would have given it zero stars but the Mei Fun and the Pepsi were actually decent.  \n\nThe buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp, Mei Fun, and maybe the sweet and sour chicken.  Skip everything else!!!!\n\nDon't even think about eating the sushi.  I was feeling adventurous so I grabbed a few of the sushi rolls that I easily recognized (california, cucumber).  One of them tried to crawl off the plate before I got back to my seat!  The rolls were chewy and just plain gross, makes my stomach turn to think about it.\n\nService was polite and good on the refills.\n\nEnter at your own risk!	0
Absolute best price for quality sushi, and well worth the quick drive from Rock Hill. Tony is a fantastic sushi chef, and an extremely nice guy, to boot. He is definitely the reason my wife and I come back so often, but the variety and quality of the buffet is great, too.	1
Not very good. Dried out food. Some things cold, when they should be hot. Disappoined overall. Not clean, either. 11.99 per person not worth it.	0
This place is absolutely filthy. We were here last year and we decided never to go back but we thought we'd give it another try. Went for dinner tonight and was disgusted. There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights, you can see splatter of food from the last decade. While I was eating, a waitress emptied plates into some bus boy buckets and some fell on the floor and she kicked it under the cart! Tons of garbage and food under these carts. Blech!! Then all the food was cold and hard. Bathroom was a hellhole. No idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way.	0
Avoid this place.  Food was decent, but a lot of it was cold and did not taste fresh.  I tried the crab legs on the buffet, and as soon as I cracked them an ammonia smell was present.  \nThey had a lot of American dishes on the buffet as well, over salted and overall not that good.  \nThe other food was decent, but as I said before was cold.  \nHowever, the sushi was decent, not the quality you expect at an actual sushi restaurant.  But the guy making made me a custom roll and was very nice about it.  \n\nHowever, if you do come, just get the sushi, it's worth the price and just avoid the buffet.	0
Did not like it. Luke warm food that was not appetizing or tasteful. Not the cleanest establishment.	0
"I am usually reluctant to complain, but....\nToday I paid $29.99 for \""managers special\"" which included the works.  Poor job.  Carpets poorly vacuumed, exterior of car still had dirt on it, leather seats not cleaned properly, and the console was filled with water.   Armor-all protectant all over the place and not wiped down properly.  Air freshener that smells like urinal cake.  Pleasant staff, but poor quality work."	0
Stay Away!  They damaged my car. If I were you I would not risk taking my car or any other vehicle to auto bell.	0
I've taken my car here at least twice. Both times it failed on a defective license bulb.\nNot the biggest problem in the world of maintenance but they charged me $8 to screw it in.\n\nIf you get your car tested here, I would recommend checking your bulbs first and if they say they need to be replaced, buy the bulb from them but screw it in yourself.	0
My vehicle was failed state inspection because of a claim I was missing specific emission equipment. So I went to the dealership to pickup the missing parts and the dealership informed me that my vehicle has never had the emissions parts in question.	0
My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. \n\nOnce we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. \n\nOh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience.	0
My wife and I had great service from Spring when we ate here a few nights ago. We always ask for either her or Tiffany. Unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that I ordered for dinner were foul. The steak was either overcooked or it was bordering on raw. Thank Gods for the fluffy buttermilk pancakes & hot maple syrup. Without them I'd have gone hungry that night.\n\nYou might wonder why we continue to eat there given the plethora or marginal experiences, well it is very cheap & its closer to the house than driving down to Carrowinds to go to Cracker Barrel.	0
Josh is awesome!! Great server. Get the ayce pancakes. Yum!	1
The service was very friendly, but the food wasn't all that good. Most everything tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a while before being plated. Especially the potatoes. Not sure I would return.	0
My wife asked me if I wanted to go to iHop tonight and naturally I said yes. I have to protect my dukedom. I ordered the country sausage potatoes, pumpkin pancakes & grits. It will probably be good. Their grill guy is pretty consistent in turning out good food. There are quite a few people here for a Saturday night. Well the food was barely warm. Not an auspicious start to the meal. Cold grits aren't a treat. All in all I wondered why we bothered going.\n\nWe went to iHop for brunch today 11/5/12 around noon & had Katrina as our server. It wasn't the best meal as far as service was concerned. I had to call her back to the table to refill my drink. Apparently my empty glass wasn't enough of a visual cue. The meal itself was average, a bacon cheeseburger with fries and sweet tea. I don't think of iHop as a lunchtime destination and I probably never will.	0
I'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the French onion pot roast. I can safely say that I will never order either again. The soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt. The pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever. It was tender but the mushrooms and carmelized onions were not in evidence. To make matters worse the corn was flavorless and the mashed potatoes had no butter. Tiffany failed as our server tonight but Tracey stepped up and refreshed our drinks and brought me melted butter and grilled onions.	0
New menus at ihop means higher prices! Wonderful. It seems that everything on the menu has gone up by at least $1.00 across the board. I had a Country Omelet with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelet was uninspired. It had no flavor whatsoever. Thank God for ketchup! The red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them.  THey were brown on the outside & an odd shade of dark pink on the inside. They also were flavorless but they had some sickeningly sweet cream cheese flavored paste drizzled all over them. Then the stack was topped with whipped cream. Whipped cream? Really? Maybe that goes over well with children but for an adult its a little creepy. The accompanying dinner theater provided by other diners & the sweet tea were the highlights of the meal.\n\nThe other strange thing about iHop is that the food never comes out hot, only warm. I think the grills are just for show. I think that they warm everything in an Easy Bake oven under a 10watt bulb.	0
Cedric is our server. A nice polite young man. I ordered a breakfast sampler. The restaurant is absolutely packed this morning. The food was hot & delivered promptly. Cedric was a great server I'd be happy to have him serve us again.	1
(6/16/13) Its time to use my free birthday coupon. Argh, the menus have changed again. According to Spring the prices have gone up an average of 0.20 across the board. The new menus also are missing the side items for non breakfast foods. The pictures for each dish are closer to the ways that the dishes actually look rather than some corporate artist's fantasy.\n\nI had an omelet with red velvet pancakes & sweet tea. It was good, comfort food that hit the spot better than Red Robin did.	1
Food was very salty. I think I'm bout to have a heart attack. God took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten. Anyhoo I was so hungry I ignored the salty food and scarfed it down. There seasonal fruit contained 3 canned pineapples and 2 canned grapes.	0
Absolutely authentic Japanese grocery store in the town. Japanese food only!  This is not a big store, but I can find almost 90% things I need to cook.  I love their frozen fishes, variety choice at a reasonable price.  I love their frozen tofu stuffs and frozen fish balls. I put these for my homemade hot pot.  They also have some vegetables and snacks. They are at Westinghouse in Pineville, I just drive 5 more minutes after I take exit 65B.	1
I always go here for oil changes they are quick and cheap not to mention its the closest jiffy lube to my house. they also send great coupons via mail/email! and its not usually crowded. i love it.	1
I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that, and kept trying to sell me crap.  Over-priced, slow, very dirty, and an overall sketchy vibe.	0
First time customer 5/10/213.\n\n They are not very through. Went in for an inspection and failed due a broken passenger mirror and weak wipers. I repaired the mirror at another location and they noticed my belts were split and cracking very badly. If it was not for the mirrors, they would have passed me and my car would have been in bad shape later down the road. I'm glad I did not get my oil changed there who knows what would have happened	0
"Our country club recently hired the building company to install a rather large deck. After it was installed, several boards warped on the railing causing the dowels to fall out (dangerous) and the facia board all the way around warped. After MANY calls and emails they finally had someone show up only to say \""warping isn't covered\"". It arped after one month! They said they would fix it for additional money - $1200. I can promise you these people will NOT stand behind their work and if you can find another retailer/contractor, I highly recommend doing so. Do not do business with these people."	0
I agree with the 1 star here. It seems every time I'm in here I catch these guys when they have had a bad day. I'm in alot of businesses during the day and this has to be my least favorite one to go to. Not because of the product but the customer experience!	0
The Pineville Ice House is kinda crappy. There is no lobby. You walk in and you're in the ice rink, so there isn't a warm place to hang out or put on your skates. The ice is not great quality, and I've been pretty disappointed overall with my experiences there. If you're looking for a rink in Charlotte, check out the Extreme Ice Center.	0
The Pineville Icehouse is geared for hockey only.  The public skate times are too short and too expensive.  I tried renting skates, 3 pairs and no luck.  The first pair had laces that were cobbled together from 2 different skates.  The blades were dull and rounded over like an old butter knife.  The second pair was better, but the left blade was bent to the right at a 10 degree angle making it impossible to skate.  The last pair was a bit better, but wholly unusable.  This wasn't just my experience, this was the experience of all 7 of us in the group.  All the skates had been abused and hadn't seen a sharpener or any maintenance in quite some time.  \n\nWe decided to stick with Extreme Ice in Indian Trail.  It is a bit of a drive, but a professional operation start to finish.  New skates, longer skate times and a pro shop that caters to other skaters, not just hockey.	0
"I have lived all over the US and even globally and I can honestly say that in my opinion FairPoint is the WORST telephone company I have ever dealt with. I moved in 11/2009 and they are still holding my credit balance refund hostage. When I called to request information, the company says I need to have a court order or be an attorney to have access to my own account information!? When I pointed out that the latter applies, I was transferred to another department. Even the managers are rude, unkind and argumentative. They don't dispute that they owe me money just that they should actually pay it to me in any kind of a reasonable timeframe. When I had their actual phone and internet service, it was highly unreliable, too and the technicians were almost as \""nice\"" as the customer service people. If you live in an area where you have a choice, exercise that choice and go with a different company!"	0
"If there were a \""zero stars\"" rating, Fairmont would have MORE THAN earned it.\nThis company leveraged itself to the eyebrows to purchase the right to use Verizon's obsolete landline infrastructure; the hedge funds that now own it have steadfastly refused to upgrade that infrastructure, with resulting extended outages for business and residential customer throughout the region.\nWe've had our business DSL line for three years. In that time we haven't had 30 consecutive days of uninterrupted service. Their \""routing issues\"" have been daily, and their customer support structure is dysfunctional: the only thing they seem to have mastered is the \""I'm terribly sorry for you inconvenience\"" portion of their telephone script. \nSince their latest foray into union-busting here it has only become worse. We in Vermont very much hope that our public service regulators will go after this mountain of corporate grift will all guns blazing: we've had enough of southern corporate carpetbaggers making promises they are systemically incapable of delivering on."	0
My 97 year old mother who is blind moved from one room to another and the company said it would take a week to change the phone because it was a holiday.  After the week was up they said the work order was extended a month because they had so much new business.   I escalated the issue.   The said they would get back to me within 48 hours.  No response.  Some company!	0
I was new in town and needed an eyebrow wax. I found the Spa at Ballantyne and decided to give it a try. Although I received a skewer of yummy pinneaple while I was waiting for my technician that was the highlight of my expereince. We got in the room and after what seemed like just two strips pulled off she said I was done. She didn't have a mirror in the room so she said I could use a metal bowl to try and see my reflection or we could go into the bathroom and she could tweeze and strays in there. Are you kidding?\nThis wouldnt have been so bad if it was super cheap, but the waxing was $20 and then they add automatic tip on there so it came to $24. There are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money.	0
UPDATE: I mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints. I was surprised when I received a phone call from the director. He wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition, updating the spa, etc. He refunded our money and offered us a massage at no cost so that we could be impressed and change our minds about this place. We were looking forward to a great experience, as promised and I fully planned on updating my rating here on Yelp.\n\nSo, I called last week to book our appointments only to find that the director is no longer with the spa. I left a message with the spa manager and after several days she has yet to return my call. I guess the good service left with the director.	0
UPDATE #2 - spoke with the new spa manager and she promises a great experience for my friend and me. I will update.	0
Update # 3...OK we went for our 'great experience'. It was ok. Massages themselves were good-to-great. Nothing else was improved. No follow-up from the manager considering the situation. I promise you that you can find something better to do with $175.	0
Over crowded, loud, and not a relaxing experience. Stayed at the hotel and booked two massages. Was looking forward to a tranquil  environment, sadly that did not happen. The service was below par and did not measure up to the quality of the hotel. I was not told about the facilities available, it was loud, crowded, I was told I could relax after massage with my husband, that did not happen, and checking in was not smooth. Sadly not worth the money or time.	0
I made a reservations for my bf and i at the spa on 6/14/14 to have a relaxing Day but they gave me a stressful week. It was a really nice place. i was planning to go again but not anymore.\nI was very disappointed when i found out that i got charged twice and got 2 overdraft fees because of the spa and the amount was  different compared to the first time being charged also my bf got charged and it was a different amount too. I think this was fraud because they charged our cards different amounts without our authorization. I received a refund a week later from the spa after several disputes.	0
This is the best Hampton Inn that I have ever stayed in. We love the magic behind the mirrors in the bathroom. The management and the staff are fantastic also. If any of our family comes to town, this is where they will stay.	1
Lovely hotel. Big work desk to get stuff done on your laptop. High speed Internet. Pillow top bed so comfy. 3 TVs in double queen suites. You guess where the third tv is. Security safe in each room. Refrigerator, microwave, plenty of storage space, pull out couch (bed), and continental breakfast with SAUSAGE and waffles.  Waking distance to upscale shops, theater, restaurants (P.F. Chang crowded&wait).	1
Attended a seminar at this hotel recently and found it to be a great place for a corporate event. The hotel lobby is nice and ballrooms are well equipped for all sorts of meetings. The only possible problem is parking - it seems that could be a bit of an issue if there is a lot going on at the time of your event.	1
Very nice hotel. Had a King bed with a whirlpool tub. The best part was the tv in the mirror in bathroom. Hotel had complimentary tea, coffee and cookies. The reason I took a star off was because we prepaid with one credit card at a certain rate, and upon checkout were billed again for the night for a totally different rate. The front desk did finally take care of this. Also at breakfast there was no food ready and we had to wait about 15 mins. Other than that the hotel was very nice	1
i have never been in a hampton inn this nice!  it felt like a much higher end hotel - also cost more than the typical hampton inn.  i had a 1st floor room, private patio with table and chairs, beautiful room.  the neighborhood is nice, can walk and shop and explore - upscale shops and lots of nice places to dine.\nonly criticism is the fitness facility which was lame - 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, 1 bench, dumbbells to 50 lbs.  no place to do situps, no yoga type mats, small and crowded room without a clock on the wall!	1
As you pull down the promenade and approaching the hotel, you pass by some amazing shops, restaurants and a theater within walking distance.  The first thing that I noticed when I walked in past the giant fountain was the free wifi in the lobby.  Although wifi in the room is limited, short and slow.  The entrance is bright, open in a colonial style with piano and complimentary coffee, tea and cookies.  TV in the bathroom.  WOW!!  Not only that, but curved shower curtain and tiled shower.  The Neutrogena toiletries are a good touch.  The bedding was very comfortable.  Always love a free breakfast, but is also a great grocery and cafe next door.  Overall it is better than your typical Hampton with some great little touches.	1
I've stayed at 3 Marriott properties this week and this is both the worst of the 3, and of any I've stayed at in at least a year.  \n\nThe location is bad (you hear the flights coming and going), there isn't good food  (non-hotel, non-fast food), within a reasonable walking area, the shuttle service is poor (35 minute wait for a 6 - 7 minute ride), the front desk was rude, the bar staff was very inexperienced, and as an elite member I still got stuck with a room with a funky odor next to the elevator.\n\nNext time I'll stay at a higher quality hotel further away from the airport.	0
"They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they \""were already at the airport\"". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clowns"	0
Worst service in a Marriot.  My key did not work, went to the office and she did not even check my name!!!!.... Waited for the shuttle around 40 min at the airport.  Not even friendly people working there...	0
Real close to the airport. Modern rooms, comfortable beds, nice bistro downstairs in the lobby with a mini bar. All the staff we encountered was friendly. \n\nIt was nice to have a porch outside on the upper floors. There are chairs and tables out there. \n\nBathrooms are average.	1
I had two dogs, fries, and a coke for lunch.  The cheese was the individually wrapped American slices torn in 1/2, the bun was your plain white basic variety, the chili right out of a can, and the meat typical. Frankly (haha), it didn't do anything for me.  Because of some of the other stellar reviews, I'll have to give it another try, maybe the green dogs?  Friendly enough with a small town diner ambiance.	0
I have been going to Green's for 40 years and I haven't found a better dog yet! I have found some that were close though. There are a few folks that have mentioned on here that  the chili is from a can. I know for a fact that their chili is homemade! If it is from a can maybe someone can email me and tell me which brand it is so I can buy it. The things I like about the dogs are the steamed buns. That way they are moist and practically melt in your mouth. The franks are boiled and they are fat and juicy. \nThe onions are a sweet type like vidalia and they are choped real fine so they aren't lumpy. I usually get 2 all the way with a Pepsi. If you are looking for a really good hot dog I say give them a try and if you know of a better place let me know!	1
I try to eat healthy on most days, but sometimes you just want to be bad and scarf down a couple chili dogs. This is the place to go to fulfill that urge. \n\nGreen's is a Charlotte institution. An old school lunch counter that also offers burgers, sandwiches, crinkle fries, onion rings, etc... but the dog is the way to go here. Unless you are my pal Eddie, who swears by the livermush sandwich here.\n\nIt's nothing fancy. Just a lunch spot where you can get a hot dog done right. I suggest getting it slathered in Green's homemade chili.\n\nThere is a parking lot next to the building. It is a pay lot. I recommend parking on the street and feeding the meter instead.\n\nI guess my only real complaint about Green's is that it's not open on Sundays, unless the Panthers are at home.	1
I almost hate writing this review, because Green's is such a Charlotte institution. I almost feel like I'm dissing my adopted city by saying this, but I just don't see what the big deal is about this place. When I first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as The Varsity in Atlanta. News tip: they aren't, and they aren't by a longshot. What's worse, the three or four times I've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent. Maybe the hot dog is cold, but the chili is hot. I dunno... I WANT to like this place, but just can't.	0
"Old school diner, known for chili-dogs\n\nMost of the reviews here are on point.   We were there early so mostly had breakfast which was darned good.  I was not all that impressed with the chili-dogs frankly (sorry...pun).  \""Lost in time\"" type of diner.  Def worth a shot if you've never been."	1
Little confused here.. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week, when the lady saw me coming (she was on her cell phone) she hid behind the grill and didn't address me, so I walked away and went to another dog stand... is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart??	0
"Didn't see too much in particular that I loved about this place. It is very small, and is truly a \""grab and go\"" kind of place amongst the shops in Uptown. Considering all of the other coffee shops in the area you can find, I would probably skip here and go somewhere else."	0
"From the burned up bagels to the Stepford Wives, glazed over look of the staff, I will no longer be degrading myself by going to Jackson's Java. Today was the last straw. After paying for my muffin (with nobody else in line mind you) the staff began to chit chat, all the while I just stood there with my hands folded and no muffin. By the time someone uttered \""What's he waiting on\"" I had already began my exit. Fair food, fair coffee, horrible customer service, I would recommend seeking out the nearest Starbucks and avoid Jackson's Java like the plague."	0
Located next to the lobby area of Well Fargo 3, this little coffee shop is fantastic. They always seem to have unique roasts from the world's most popular coffee regions. I'm not sure who does the roasting or where they buy their beans but it is easily better than Caribou and Starbucks.\nI have only had two of the pastry offerings and they were also worth the money as a breakfast. It is kind of tucked away but if you are on that side of Uptown, consider trying to find it. You won't be disapointed.	1
They are undergoing a change to their rewards program, be VERY careful that they moved your rewards over, I am missing a LOT of drinks. \n\nThe selections of coffee is good, like that they have almond milk and a variety of sugar free syrups. They will also sell whole bottles of syrup, which I really appreciate!\n\nBaked goods are usually fresh and I like that you can get plain oatmeal or jazz it up with certain toppings. \n\nStaff seems to turn over quickly, which I dislike, but they are typically friendly hipsters who take pride in making a great drink.	1
This is an excellent, boutique hotel for anyone who has business or pleasure travel in Uptown Charlotte. It's right in the heart of the uptown commercial district, so if your business is there, you can park the car and walk to your destination. \n\nThe accommodations are beautiful and comfortable. The staff is friendly and fairly formal, but not over-the-top. I've heard the hotel restaurant is great, and features ingredients from local farms, but I haven't tried it yet. \n\nThe Dunhill is not cheap but my company has a group rate which I am happy to take full advantage of. And I also prefer an independent, boutique hotel over a nondescript chain.	1
"This place is great. It's an old building but they really make it work and don't fight their limitations at all.  It's well located, there's a bar in the lobby (watch yourself, that guy pours em stiff), and the staff give a crap.  The only drawback is the parking situation ...and it's a little hard to actually drive to the building itself, given the whole \""crazy series of one-way streets\"" in downtown Charlotte.  But yeah, I thought it was fantastic all around - oh, and the price for it all is great."	1
My husband and I visited the Dunhill, originally planning to spend our wedding night there. They are historic, quaint, and conveniently located in Charlotte. Walking in to the check-in desk was a breeze. Everyone was very friendly. Walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel. It really could use some restoring. The hotel room was small, bathroom was small as well (though they've tried to modernize it with decoration & hardware), and just overall underwhelming. The ceiling had many water spots where water had leaked from above and dried the ceiling yellow. They also have a restaurant in the hotel with good eggs benedict, but for the price, I wasn't impressed. Again, friendly, great historic hotel (which I normally love), but didn't live up to its reputation for us. (We visited before our wedding and booked a room at the Ritz, which in Dunhill's defense, was brand spankin' new.)	0
We booked through Hotwire while in town for a bowl game under their hot rate, so you don't know what hotel you get until after you pay for it.  Let's just say if you like small rooms with a small bed, in a small historical hotel with only apx 65 rooms then this is your place.  They had no king size beds or rooms with two double beds available in the rooms they had left.  Location was decent, but prefer to be closer to the action near more restaurant selection.	0
If I could give 10 stars I would!  This hotel went above and beyond when my Uncle fell ill and had to be hospitalized while visiting Charlotte.  They used their London Cab to come and pick us up at the hospital even though it was out of their cab range.  They also gave me a discounted rate on another room so I could stay in Charlotte and take care of my Uncle.  Now on to the hotel itself, it is gorgeous!  The rooms are spacious and so quiet.  I didn't hear a peep from any of my neighbors in the two different rooms I stayed in.  The complimentary breakfast is on point!  Look no further if you are looking for a place in Charlotte that will make you feel like you are part of their family.	1
This review is just for the bar, as I am local and live in Charlotte.  I highly recommend locals and hotel guests alike to stop into the Dunhill bar for a drink.  Pete, the bartender, is the BEST and will take good care of you!  He mixes up some amazing cocktails and provides spot-on recommendations if you need them.	1
Stayed here overnight while visiting for the Liverpool-AC Milan game. \n\nArrived at 3:30pm but the room wasn't even ready despite check in being 3pm. \n\nBed in room wasn't a queen size it was a full size so this is false advertising. I know this for a fact as we just changed from a full size to a queen size bed at home so we are aware of the size difference. In addition the mattress was very soft and the bed frame felt like it might fall apart any time - so we didn't have a great night's sleep which made the 7 hour drive home tough!\n\nA/C unit on wall glowed bright blue all through the night, there was no way to turn off the glow without turning off the A/C which would have made the room too hot.\n\nRoom itself was small but nice enough, I appreciate this is a downtown hotel so you don't get value for money at those type of hotels, but still we personally cannot recommend it.	0
the hotel meets the proper standard marriot network and meet the expectations. is in a good location, the city requires car or taxi for transportation. cleaning and hotel services also left me satisfied.	1
the location of the motel is excellent, next to the walk of fame. The presence of good parking. The rooms are typical motel but the thing to remember is the cleanliness of the rooms which is not very accurate (the extractor fan in the bathroom had dust that almost completely otturava). Needless to say, not a hotel to go with small children. In fact, even though we had specifically asked the cradle in the reservation made one month in advance, no one to check in told us that they did not have cots. Breakfast is completely forgettable, better do it for a fee at the nearby Starbucks.	1
We booked this hotel as we want to watch the Xmas Lakers game. It is close enough to walk and right in the middle of NC  downtown.\nThe area is not as I expected as te downtown looks doggy and the hotel also show some age.\nRestaurant very limited and not too many good food around.	1
This boutique hotel is hard to beat. Decent prices for a great experience. Excellent location in the center of everything: within a 5 block radius, there are dozens of wine bars, eateries, nice restaurants, and even clubs & lounges.\n\nTheir rooms have good wifi, free sodas and water bottles in their fridge, and they sometimes come during the evenings with free mini Ghirardelli chocolates to hand out. Rooms also stocked with luxurious bath towels and robes.\n\nBeds were comfy, albeit on the softer side. Linens were crisp and clean. The restroom was super spacious and decked out in white & grey marble. \n\nThey offer free breakfast  that starts at 6:30AM, as well.	1
If you are rolling down Highway 277 and you see this giant building, you may easily mistake it for a church.  The beautiful stone walls of this artistic chapel drew me in automatically.  I came here for the show called True Grit: Frames, Fixations and Flirtations, which is a blend of woodwork and other types of craft with art.  The exhibit was very interesting and I would recommend checking it before Nov. 1st.  The center itself is pretty breathtaking with wood planks holding up the building and a great view of the city through it's long windows.  I have several friends who do woodwork, so I enjoyed this exhibit very much.	1
Turns out the old, burned down looking church at the end of Tryon and 11th is actually a great museum for Visual Art - who knew! Yes, this gem of a museum in our city is pretty frickin' cool if you ask me. From the ultra sleek modern interior, to the industrial and raw materials that you'll see showcased throughout the exhibits, the McColl Center boasts some pretty cool urban exhibits along with a really enthusiastic volunteer staff! Jason is my favorite guide and they're always excited to talk with you about the current exhibits, history of the church and what's coming next - a rareity if you've been to the sleepy new Mint Uptown (I find their staff a bit bored which is a shame with all the awesome stuff they have in that place!).\n\nDo yourself a favor and stop in this place - it's a gem here in Charlotte!	1
I am going to keep this simple. My wife and I ate dinner at the McNinch house for our 5 year anniversary. The place was so slow. The valet guy was our waiter and bus boy. (probably the chef also, but not positive) The food was ok at the best. $300 and we both left and ate pizza. Enough said?	0
My wife and I went for our anniversary the year before last, but as other reviewers have stated, I remember the experience like it was yesterday.  For a proper experience be prepared to pay in excess of $200 per person for the entrees and wine pairing.  My wife and I opted for the Chef's tasting menu, which if memory serves me correct was 9 courses.  I highly recommend this choice, what is an extra $20 per person when you are already spending so much?  It really is about the experience... and Ellen and company make it an excellent, nay, perfect experience!	1
We had a 5-course meal and wine pairings.  The wine is why I gave it 2-stars; otherwise would've been worse as food was very bland.  No creativity to the cooking.  I enjoy extremely nice meals but McNinch is way overpriced for what you get.	0
It's a neighborhood place in one of Charlotte's nicest neighborhoods....the Fourth Ward.  The food is good.  The service is good.  The setting is GREAT!	1
Just wow. If you ever come to Charlotte, go to the 4th Ward... its one of the most interesting downtown residential neighborhoods I've ever been in. When you go there, make sure you stop in here for some fantastic people watching and great beers. \n\nSeriously, walking here transports you completely away from the hustle and bustle and rowdiness of Tryon.	1
Al Mike's is my favorite neighborhood bar in Charlotte, NC.  The only problem with it is that its too far away from my house!  :)  It is a treat to visit the 4th ward.  Great food, drinks, and company!	1
"3.5 stars overall..bumped up to a 4 for being...\""cozy\"".. as one of my friends put it.  Solid food and a good place to start out a night.  A good way to get away from all the new and experience something with true Charlotte style."	1
The food is OK, but the selling point is it is one of the few places in Charlotte that has culture and history.  An old victorian building in a neighborhood that feels more like Charleston than Charlotte.  Tired of uptown chains and overprices bistros, head to this place.  Great beer selection and a pub feel make this a great pick.	1
Cute little bar tucked away in the 4th ward neighborhood.  Fun atmosphere - and apparently a big pole in the middle of the women's bathroom (see back of menu).  \n\nHad the nachos, fried pickles and the crawfish burrito, all of which were tasty.	1
Love this place.  Great food and unique character.  A must if you live in Charlotte.	1
This place is great for a chill dinner and drinks. A very laid back atmosphere makes it perfect for dinner before heading out or just relaxing all night. It has a bar atmosphere without the crazy drunks and extremely loud crowd. The food isn't 5 star, but you can never go wrong with Fried Pickles and the What It Is. YUM!	1
Nice food selections, great drinks of course.\n\nGreat fourth ward place. My beef here is the lighting is just TOO dark. Cain't see the dang menus or nuthin! But a fine neighborhood bar.\n\nAnd fried pickles!!!	1
LOVE everything about this place.  Great atmosphere, great date place, great bar, and great food!  You must try the nachos!  Everything on the menu is good, and they have Warsteiner on tap!	1
One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. Definitely a locals spot. They have the best wings in town (Texas wild wings). They remembered my name after my first trip. Can't say enough about the place. Check it out.	1
I've been to Alexander Michael's a few times now and always have a great time.  It has a ton of character - tucked away on a little street of old houses in the 4th ward.  The wait staff is always friendly, there is a nice beer selection and I hear the food is good too (though I've never tried it).  The dining area takes up a large portion of the space and consists of very intimate, cozy booths and tables with dim lighting.  I believe it closes at 11, so it lends itself to a more relaxed crowd.	1
Incredible nachos.  Incredible food. Try their best sellers.  Atmosphere is quaint. Great for a casual date night. Enjoy!	1
Luckily for me, this restaurant is only a five-minute walk from work so it's always one of my top choices for lunch. The London Broil sandwich wasn't as medium-rare as I'd ordered, but delicious nonetheless. \n\nOne thing I appreciate about this restaurant is the frequency of daily-specials they offer during lunch. Everytime I've gone, they've offered at least two specials of the day, which shows some kitchen character. I'll definitely be back again.	1
One of my favorite places to eat in Uptown. My go to dishes are the London broil entree and the what it is. Tried out most of the menu and can't say I've had anything bad. The daily specials are usually pretty great as well.	1
One of my Favorite Resturants in Charlotte try the What it is you won't be disapointed !!	1
Back in Aug when I was out in Charlotte a co -worker took me to Alexander Michael's.  This place is a cute neighborhood gem.  I loved it!  It's removed from the main uptown area of Charlotte and it seems like this is the place where locals go.\n\nMy dinner was awesome.  I ordered their blackend cat fish sandwich with fried pickles.  Yum!  Since, fried pickles don't exist in CA, I loved eating them while I was out in Charlotte.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I would eat at this place again.   ;o)	1
One of the best spots in all of Charlotte.  Great for business lunches.  The london broil sandwich is one of the best steak sandwiches I have ever had.  Nice atmosphere and good beer selection too.	1
There's something about the simplicity of this place, and the friendliness of the staff, that keeps bringing me back here. Since I've moved to Charlotte, I've tried the fried  pickles at almost every restaurant I've been to, and I have to say.. the ones at Alexander Michael's are among the top three in this city! The food is simple and tasty (even if you just want a simple garden burger, Cajun fried & a blue moon!) The atmosphere is cozy and unpretentious. It's a great place to visit even on a Monday evening!	1
Great atmosphere great service great food!! Charlotte charm.	1
Such a great low key place to go and have a great dinner. Their Fried pickles are amazing and have an awesome beer selection! This is my go to place for a fun relaxing evening dinner uptown.	1
"I'm going to be the odd person and not give this place a glowing review.\n\nFirst off, the atmosphere is actually cool.  This is a true pub.  Beautiful dark wood is everywhere.  The staff is also very nice, no complaint there.\n\nThe thing is, I don't really have a complaint, I'm just not impressed with the food.  I find it acceptable, but nothing special.  In fact, the menu is, to me, kinda boring.  I think the point of this place is more to go \""have a few\"" after work and such.  When looking for great food in uptown, this place wouldn't make my list.  I do love that it's locally owned and operated, however, and harbor no ill feelings."	0
I really enjoyed this restaurant. It was inviting, and the food was good. We had the nacho appetizer which was big enough for both of us. The black beans with all the salad yummies could have been a meal in itself. No room for dessert!	1
This place is amazing. It is a hidden restaurant right in uptown Charlotte. \n\nThe food is amazing. The drinks are amazing, especially the beer selection. It is also a very good place for date night, bro night, or just night. It is so good. :D\n\n Parking is on the street and it is only for two hours without permit. Just FYI. :D	1
"Perfect hole in the wall, true pub. The half pound burger is maybe the best I've ever had and the selection of local brews is the perfect compliment. If you are a local looking for a \""regular spot,\"" or a tourist looking for that \""place only the locals know about,\"" Al Mike's is it!"	1
The spicy crab soup and the chicken leek  soup were delicious and I suspect homemade. The Ruben washed down with the Mecktoberfest beer was a good combo.  Very good lunch and would come back to try the dinner menu.	1
This a wonderful neighborhood bar and restaurant!  The type place you can find in Atlanta or other large city.  The food is very good and the service is excellent.  The draft beer selection is good.  I highly recommend this place.	1
My family and I were in Charlotte, North Carolina and decided to stop here because of Yelp. As it turns out this was the best restaurant wr have been to in a while. Quality food, large portions, relatively fast seating, and great service.	1
We've been to Alexander Michaels a few times and love it each time. I find it to be romantic and quant. Our last trip was on Valentine's Day. We arrived early as they are first come first serve even on Holidays.  We started out with two beers and an order of potato wedges. The bacon and cheese covered dish was delicious and I'd get it again (without tomatoes).  For my entree I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with Cajun Fries and my husband had the London Broil Sandwich. We both enjoyed our meal and would recommend both menu items. We did not have any dessert this time, so can't comment on that. Our server was very nice and had a to-go box waiting for me before I had to ask. I would recommend visiting Al Mikes with out-of-towners, after work drinks or a romantic dinner date. It has the d\u00e9cor of a tavern, is very dim and crowded inside. You can tell the neighborhood loves this place because like other Charlotte favorites we've found it packed all the time. Enjoy!	1
Bad food. Bug problem. In a neighborhood full of homeless roaming the streets like zombies.	0
"Was taking the famous Fourth Ward Secret Gardens Tour on this beautiful Sunday....which was awesone by the way. Saw that Alexander Michaels was open for this event. Was immediately greeted by Cooper, the host and owner's son. And yes ladies he is a \""hunk.\"" And a hell of a nice guy too! I shared some of the other female Yelp reviews with him and he laughed.\n\nDue to the other Yelp reviews I started with the fried pickles. Theirs were very lightly battered so you can actually TASTE the pickles! I thought that was great, along with the standard Ranch dipping sauce.\n\nCooper recommended the Penne Athena which was a nice, light chicken dish with black olives, red peppers and a light mushroom cream sauce. Very tasty and indeed not too heavy following my walkibg tour. \n\nOverall very good! Cooper, Milt at the bar were super gracious and friendly hosts! Can't wait to come back to try their 4th Ward Stroganoff."	1
Looking for a neighborhood restaurant, with great service, fun environment. This is worth your trip. Be sure to park the car near the neighborhood park/playground.	1
Brought family here from out of town and glad we did. Service and food were great. Staff was welcoming and the bartender helped us find beers our guests would like. Server made good, honest suggestions about the menu and checked on us throughout the night.  We will definitely be back.	1
Perfect atmosphere. Best BLT, fried pickles and pasta salad(with Stevie's dressing.) One of my favorites in Charlotte.	1
I came here for lunch this week on a business lunch with two other people. I had never heard of Alexander Michael's until a client recommended it. It is situated in a house just a couple blocks from the heart of Uptown. The environment inside is very pleasant and homey. It has a true neighborhood pub feel. The service was excellent, even during the busy lunch rush. \n\nI got the london broil sandwich and it was tasty. My coworker highly enjoyed the buffalo chicken sandwich. My client got the chicken pita which he really liked a lot. He opted for the pasta salad as a side and said it was great.\n\nI want to come back sometime to try out the dinner options!	1
I don't know what the hype is. I ordered steak which came out luke warm and over salted. It seemed old. Also my veggies weren't seasoned at all and were not even steamed. Not interested in returning.	0
My husband and I went for lunch here and we loved it! It's located in a great location uptown and the service was great! My husband enjoyed the wings and I had a fantastic sandwich! Can't wait to go back and experience during dinner.	1
"I wish the GPS had been right about the derelict building it had initially brought me to....I would have been happily on my way to a satisfying meal elsewhere.....perhaps a place that doesn't have two legal parking places in a 5 block radius ....one of which is occupied by the restaurants mascot. An old beat up pick up truck....which seems to have avoided citation for 20 years. \n\n When this gem was recommended to me as a fantastic \""seasonal\"" restaurant, I wanted to call them immediately and ask them what season we were in that served these nasty, cold, ..\nOh but \""smoked\""quesadillas .  or perhaps when a good time of the year it was to enjoy this warm on the outside...cold on the inside tuna melt.  The waitress seemed shocked that one could possibly eat it any other way.   \n\n About 2/3 through the meal, we were asked to settle up...because at that time of day... Something with their computers demanded them to stop all service... And start a new tab.\n\n \n\n Nothing special on this menu.... Overrated pub grub."	0
The food here is great.  Diane the waitress is wonderful.  Of course all of Peter's family are great too.  His daughter waited on us and she was fantastic.  I love my Greek Omelette with Gyro!!  Thanks Diane for having my breakfast ready everyday.  See you soon.	1
"Looking for something entertaining to do with family visiting from out-of-town, I took them to the Levine Museum of the New South.  It was my first visit, too, and I enjoyed the exhibits and seeing a cultural part of the city that I hadn't seen before. \n\nTheir permanent exhibit is \""Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers\"" about the history of North Carolina and the way its changed from its beginnings.  It was very informative and by far the best exhibit we saw that day.  I loved the lifesize stores and rooms you can walk through to really get a feel of what it was like to live in NC from the Civil War to the present.  It was also a great history lesson in civil rights and how its evolved over the past 150 years or so.  We easily spent the better part of an entire afternoon there and felt good about doing so."	1
Very objective and incredibly well written. Deceptively large and packed with with information.\n\nPrepare to take at least an hour and be ready for a history that pulls no punches. The truth hurts and so everything from slavery and the life of the poor farmer to the whole lynching dedicated exhibit is incredibly intense and gripping.\n\nA great inspiration.	1
LEVINE MUSEUM OF THE NEW SOUTH\nWhen you're in Charlotte, North Carolina, make sure you stop by the Levine Museum of the New South. It's a great spot to learn more about the city and state... and how it went from a rural farming state supporting slavery to become the 2nd largest banking business in the country. There is an excellent video that they show that details the days of slavery and then Reconstruction to the modern day banking industry. The museum also showcases racism in the 1960s, but shows now that the state is very multi-cultural. It's a wonderful museum that shows a lot and tells a wonderful story about the history of North Carolina: past, present, and future. Stop by to learn more!	1
I don't know that I've ever been so impressed with the layout and thoroughness of a museum. I usually get dragged to them because my mom is such a fan and has to hit at least one in every town we visit, but I have to say I'm glad we visited this one. \n\nI learned a lot and got a whole new perspective on the area. \n\nDefinitely recommend if you're a museum lover!	1
I enjoyed myself here, but wasn't really impressed. The museum was just as racially biased as the bigot, city of Charlotte, mentality is. The museum had some interesting facts and interesting exhibits though. My children seemed to enjoy it. It didn't hurt that it was free and parking was validated. That is also the case every Sunday. They close at 5 on Sunday, so get there before 4. The exhibit is an hour long.	1
The queen of the bloated corporate steakhouses!  Save your money.....find a local street vendor.....and buy tickets to whatever is at the Blumenthal!!	0
Yawn.\n\nI've eaten 2 meals at mortons and honestly - I can do better at home. Sure the food was good - but dropping $100+ dollars and not being thoroughly impressed isn't my idea of great value.\n\nSave you're $ go buy a steak and a $20 bottle of wine at the Harris Teeter and fire up your grill - you'll pay 30 bucks and have just as good of a meal.	0
It was the bar specials sign that gave me a craving for sliders while walking home from work one night.  My husband and I went in for Cheeseburger sliders and Petite Filet  Mignon sandwiches.  Combine this with the drink specials and you have a winning combination.\n\nThe bar area is cozy and separated from the main dining area in it's own room.  The dark wood and warm colors make it an inviting place for a small bite (though portions were a meal size for me).  There are a couple tables, a few high tops and a decent amount of seating at the bar.	1
"5+ stars!  And this coming from a girl who \""does not\"" eat steak!  The seafood is outstanding.  Shrimp Alexander is divine, Crab cakes are heavenly and the molten hot chocolate cake is to die for!!!\nMy husband thoroughly enjoys the steaks each and every time we go.  YUM!"	1
I'm sorry but what is the big deal?!? I can get great steak for a lot less $$. And everything is ala carte! No way. I was not impressed by anything here. Ruth's Chris is better! But quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments.	0
saying this place is very, very good is not giving it justice.  it is not as good as capital grille, but man is it close. again , bring 300 bucks, if you cannot afford it, don;'t go.  go to longhorns.	1
What can I say? This is beef euphoria in wine heaven! Always consistent , always delectable, always special treatment .	1
"We decided to change-up our Ruth's Chris experience with another high rated steakhouse. Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans, which happened to be the wrong style for the hostess at Morton's. After checking in with the girl at the front an unnamed judgmental man who sat us at our table made a judgmental comment \""Oh jeans I see...\"" making both my girlfriend and I uneasy and uncomfortable about the rest of our experience. \n\nThe drinks were average and the steaks were good, but not fabulous. In fairness, our waiter was very friendly, though.\n\nUnfortunately, our friendly waiter was not enough to overcome our bad initial impression.  I expected better, especially at a nice restaurant like this.\n\nWhen people are attempting to come into your establishment and spend over $150 on dinner, you should do whatever you can to make them feel as comfortable as possible.  Now I am sure never to return back to Morton's and I tell everyone I know about my negative experience."	0
Fantastic steak. Gentlemen's club decor. Professional service. Valet parking. Expensive.	1
I recently dined here for my anniversary and was deeply disappointed by the service.  Placed in a high traffic area; dirty dishes left on table; drinks not re-filled; server  not familiar with menu and special pricing; Did not get order right; I have expressed my concerns to Landry's and to the restaurant directly, and have been ignored.  The service here does not match the high prices.	0
Best steakhouse in Charlotte! The steaks are so tender & juicy there is no substitute for that beef. I'm also very impressed with chefs that know how to cook a steak to order, every time. We have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered, entrees to side dishes or deserts. Its all high quality food and super delicious. Whenever my husband and I get to treat ourselves we always choose Morton's, we love it!	1
Here for a birthday dinner for my fiance and having been to a few other Morton locations I knew what I was in store for.  And that is delicious steaks, insane deserts and outstanding service.  At least those are the things I always walk away from the place remembering.\n\nThis location is no different, great staff and comfortable atmosphere to relax with no rush to dining.\n\nThe parking is pretty non existent here so I suggest valet.	1
The food and service was excellent. Our sever Tara was on point. She was very knowledge. The restaurant is going through some remodeling and it gives it a more modern look. I enjoy everything and will be back	1
Poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality. Nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive. I would recommend Capital Grille over Morton's.	0
best steak EVER  EVER  EVER\ncajun rib eye ......juicy .. tasteful .... cooked to perfection\n\ngreat service \n\nafter bad experience at McCormick & Schmick's ... it was completely the opposite here\n\nCody was my server ... happy guy with outgoing personality .. attentive but not overbearing....\n\nthe manager was exceptional .......\n\npricey but well with it\n\nCody recommended the fresh spinach salad .. I'm not a salad guy but this was exceptional, diced salad and vinaigrette, chopped bacon, diced egg .....it was great!!\n\nif there are better steaks .... i'm truly scared to eat them.\n\nN -  JOY!	1
Dropped in for lunch on a Saturday.  Was relatively crowded, but I was able to order quickly with my food coming out a few minutes later.  \n\nI ordered the Chicago Dog all the way and a brat.  \n\nThe relish was bright green, so I was a little taken aback by it.  I gave it a shot, but it ultimately was not my taste, so it was banished to the serving container....  The remainder of the hot dog was really good though. \n\nThe brat - Nothing to write home about.  It was OK.  Not as good as a beer brat from home.  I would skip that one and just get 2 Chicago Dogs instead.\n\nIf you're looking for a hot dog in Chicago, Matt's is the place to get it!	1
Matt's Chicago Dogs are delish!  I love going there, parking is a pain, you can park in the lot at the greenway, but it is $4 for 30 mins or something crazy like that.  I drive past it and park in front of the Duke energy building at a meter and walk in for my fix.  The hot dogs are great, you can tell they take pride when they serve their food.  French fries are always hot and they have good sweet tea.  Now that is an extra bonus!!  I will rate Matt's Ch. Dogs, three corndogs.	1
"Love me a hot dog; especially Chicago dog. What makes a hot dog a true Chicago dog...well let me tell you. Steamed or water-simmered, kosher-style, all-beef frankfurter on a poppy seed bun. The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices, pickled sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt. NEVER, NEVER has ketchup. That's like putting ketchup on a Brat...absolute no, no :) \n\nMatt's, also located in Cornelius is great for a quick pit stop. They also have burgers, salads, Italian beef, etc. You can get everything \""Carolina style\"" too if you're so inclined. Located on The Green near Aquavina. Great outdoor seating on a nice day!"	1
Chicago is only minutes away from uptown Charlotte.  Didn't you know that?  Well, Matt's Chicago hot dogs were as close to authentic as you are going to get in North Carolina.  \n\nChicago Dog Ingredients: Check \nRestaurant Ambiance: Excellent (Check)\nOutdoor Seating in a Park: Check\n\nGoing back for many more hotdogs:  CHECK!!\n\nThey also offer combos so you can wash down the dog with some delicious fries and a soda.  There are several other options besides the Chicago dog if you are feeling adventurous.  They also offer burgers etc etc.  I haven't tried the burgers yet and it may be a while because I'm going to keep getting the dogs.  I love hot dogs.  Enjoy!!\n\n-Ian M.	1
Ahhhhhh. The neon green relish. The crisp, fresh pickle and tomato. The poppyseed bun. The real Vienna beef dog... well, it was a bit soft but in general the food here to me says west 35th, 55th off the Dan Ryan, or even 95th and Ewing if you know what I mean. They've got the lingo. Fresh cut fries, pizza puffs. \nSadly the decor to me says something more like Fullerton and Clark. It's just a little too nice. I know that's a strange complaint. The tables and chairs look right, but that glass-and-brass sneezeguard and the tasteful mural... eh. Its just not tacky enough. I want to see posters of thick eyebrowed women holding up kronos gyros. \nI digress. Tasteful decor is not a dealbreaker though. I'm sure I'll be back.	1
Mmm hmm it rivals red hot lovers of Ann Arbor, Michigan. I love a good chicago dog no matter where it came from and Matt knows how to make a good dog.	1
Matt's is a great stop for lunch. I have been here many times and always had great fast service. Contrary to their name, they serve food other than hot dogs...actually I think the majority is something other than a hot dog. \nI have had the cheese burger which is good, better than fast food. The homemade chips with a side of ranch are amazing! \nI have other friends that have tried other items and love them. This is a must have stop in our lunch rotation.\nOn the healthier side, they have an apple blue cheese salad that is AWESOME. It has huge slices of apple, pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and romaine lettuce with a balsamic dressing. It is one of the best salads downtown!	1
Normally I wouldn't even think about walking into a hot dog joint, then I reviewed the menu via yelp.  Much more than just hot dogs. Chicken, burgers, chix  salad, reubens, Italian beef and even BBQ pork. My brother and I were in town for work and needed to get out into the air. Short walk from our meeting, and Matt's is located on the first floor of what appears to be a newer condominium building. The entrance is adjacent to an outside green space area with multiple other shops and eateries nearby.  Fantastic seating outside and ample table space inside.  He went for the BBQ pork and I chose the Italian beef with cheese and hot peppers ( vs sweet). Au jus on the side, a basil based sauce that perfectly complemented the hoagie. Ladies, you'll need the knife and fork provided. Don't attempt to handle this one without 'em.  Well done, Matt!	1
My Hot Dog was good, but like many establishments these days the service was sub par. I walked up to the counter smiling ready to order, and the guy just stared at me like I was interrupting something that he had going on. I said Hi and he looked confused.....sooo before I placed my order I decided to give him some customer service 101......GREET!! I am amazed at the lack of individuals willing to at least do their jobs these days.	1
I have actually gone to Matt's Chicago Dog for lunch for 4 consecutive weeks. Great place for lunch. They have really fast service seemingly even when there is a crowd. I have made it my business to try a few different things all of the items I've had were great. My only complaint would be on the homemade fries. Be sure to check your order because you do not want them cold. Definitely plan on going back.	1
Two words.....PIZZA PUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Crispy fried pockets of pizza dough filled with the most mouth watering gooey cheese, bits of sausage and tangy tomato sauce inside. Sooooo good..... Do yourself a favor and get 2 of them and thank me after. I grew up in the Chicago area and everything here is just like I remember it. I just saw that they are now serving Chicago-style deep dish pizza! Can't wait to give it a try. They also have Vienna Beef hot dogs which are literally the best hot dogs you'll ever eat. I like to eat them with fries and cheese. Ask for extra crunchy fries because they tend to be soft, not crispy. Go here, you'll love it!	1
"I tried their Italian Beef and its \""meh\"". Not really close to being what you can get in Chicago, but decent for what is offered in Charlotte. I don't even know if there is another place that offers Italian Beef on their menu, but I would still eat another one here if I was pheenin' for one. \n\nAnother Chicago fav is the pizza puff. Not much they need to do with it but fry it. Can't go wrong except for destroying any diet plans and giving you a tad of heartburn for us older folks. One was good enough for me...two might be pushing it. $3.99 each and no option to make it a combo meal.\n\nThe cheese used for the cheese fries is an absolute \""boooo!\"". I will not try those again."	1
Don't know what the deal was, but on a day with a car show across the street and a basketball game a couple blocks away we were one of about 3 parties which rolled up for lunch only to find the place closed. Who knows how many folks did the same thing considering the posted Saturday hours. Then again about half of Uptown was closed. CLT remains at heart a town by, for, and of bankers. Sad.	0
I like Matt's because they make most everything right to order so the burgers, fries, etc are always piping hot and fresh.  It takes a bit longer than not doing this way but the trade off is well worth it.  Love the Italian Beef, Char Dog and Fire Dog as well.\n\nThis location is really convenient to my office so I find myself there at least a couple times a month and will continue doing so as long as they remain consistent in what they do.	1
Another Starbucks review? I've come to realize that not all Starbucks are the same and this one is somewhat lackluster. I ordered a medium iced Americano and overheard the baristas tell one another that it looked kinda weak.  They made it anyway and gave it to me.  I told them (politely of course) that it was and they made another one regular strength.  That's definitely not Starbucks signature customer service.  \n\nI can't say I will go back to this particular Starbucks, unless I'm stranded around J & W with a caffeine-deprived headache.  I agree with Jess that there are exceedingly few coffeehouses uptown.	0
My pasta tasted like rubber, I think they might have served me the display.  The crowd here was pretty rowdy and entertaining, but my dinner was no good.  I guess I don't enjoy mainstream bars like this one.  There are a lot of attractive people around, but I really didn't have a lot in common with the other patrons.  If you like kind of preppy establishments, you would enjoy this place..  It just isn't up my alley though.  I do have to say that it was clean and all of the employees know what they are doing though.	0
There is a sandwich here that is delicious.  It's called the Black Forest.  Get it.  Life changing.\n\nI really like this place mostly because the Black Forest and the drink specials.  I usually have a good time here.  The other food isn't amazing, but the atmosphere is hopping.	1
After stopping by Blackfinn for a drink on a late Friday night (what a huge mistake), we wanted a more laid back atmosphere and walked over here.  I've been to Fox and Hounds all over the country so I knew what to expect.  Had the French Dip which was loaded and very good.  This is always a pretty reliable place for decent pub grub and a beer.  But, avoid 'The Drifter' beer at all costs.. horrendous!	1
"I really liked their beer selections.  This place is a nice hometown \""big\"" bar.  Not chain-like.  The staff wasnt the friendliest but the food, beer, and prices made up for that.  I would definitely suggest checking it out on a NFL SUnday too. Whole lot of TVs.  \n\nEnjoy\n\nIan M."	1
Visited for lunch on the weekend. This place maybe good for game watching in the evenings but I do not think they are equipped for much else. \n\nI sat in a booth in the bar area and you could see they hadn't cleaned the walls in or near the booth in quite some time because of the old dried up food on the wall. Also the bathrooms where in bad shape.\n\nService: Slow and I'm not sure we where the servers to priority because there were not many other people in the place and we had to wait for everything.\n\nNot a good experience for us.	0
I'm with Mike B. I have visited 2 Fox & Hound Bars now (the other up in Huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food. \n\nBoth had good beer selection, TVs, and space. \n\nBut the food - no. I got the fish sandwich at the Huntersville location - poor choice. I got the chicken sandwch at the Tryon location - looked like it belonged on the kids menu; and it took 30 minutes, so it was also dry. I initially thought I'd give the place a 2nd chance - 2 for 2 bad food experiences is enough.	0
This place blows chunks.  I would have given it just one star but the waitresses are fab and cute.  The whole place smells like it has been through a flood and instead of getting the place cleaned properly they spent the insurance money on new cars.  \n\nI have had the wings here..blah and the veggies are gross with brown tips on the celery.  Yuck.  It is a huge space and has cool giant tvs so if I was just here to watch the game and drink it would be okey dokey.  There are a ton of places to watch the game though that have great food...sigh....	0
I really hate this place. I've given it 3 chances, and they all sucked. Food was awful. Everything fried. Clean? Fuggetaboutit!!!! Staff was overwhelmed, they tried, but to no avail. With all the superior choices within walking distance, I will never go here again.\nThis is the first, and probably only, negative review I have posted.	0
Simply a bad experience. A group of us came to Charlotte from Cheyenne for a training course and wanted a good local place have dinner and drinks. The place wasn't busy at all and it took 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get out drink order taken and get our beverages. The food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm. I assure you I will not return to this establishment on this trip or any future trips.	0
This abomination certainly left much to be desired. There was a considearble wait from the ordering of drinks to receiving them, again to order food, and even longer to get our food.\n \nWhen it finally came, they had mixed up who ordered what, wrong sides with the entree, etc. All of our orders, from the 3 steaks to the sampler platter to the mini chili dogs, were lukewarm at best. One of the steaks even managed to taste like they had dropped it into the bottom of the grill. Think smokey, like campfire-smelling clothes smokey, but flavored that way.\n\nThe manager comped a portion of our meals, but the apparent lack of cusomer service and quality control more than overshadowed his attempt to make things right. I refuse to EVER set foot in this sub-par establishment again.	0
Took for ever just to get water and to take our order. We were there for over an hour before we got our food and it was cold. Will not return.	0
The atmosphere is like any other chain sports bar, service was bad, and I don't think I will be returning. Nothing stood out about this place with so many other great options just a block away.	0
as a suscriber to the Blumenthal, there is always some great entertainment at this venue in its several concert/symphony halls. Highly recommend for dates and time with friends!	1
"Contrary to popular belief, \""The Blumenthal Performing Arts Center\"" was not a particular building, but a group of entertainment venues which included two theatres, the Belk and Booth in one building uptown.  Included in this group is also Ovens Auditorium and the new Knight Theatre, plus others. This caused so much confusion, that the enterprise recently dropped the name \""Center\"" from its name and is now known simply as \""Blumenthal Performing Arts\"" to avoid confusion.  It's a little hard to visualize Ovens and the Knight being in the same \""center\"" so this was a wise decision.\n\nAnyway, they do a great job bring quality entertainment to the QC.  They also often have good deals on prices, affinity groups, and more.  I have seen some major shows here, and almost all have been good.  This is coming from someone who has seen several shows in Toronto, which trails only NYC in theatre production in North America.  They seem to offer a little something for everyone throughout the year."	1
Perhaps Blumenthal should not be reviewed, since it is a group of venues, and an organization, rather than a single location? Ah well, here we go anyway.\n\nAs Brian has mentioned, many have confused the Belk Theater for the Blumenthal, when actually, Blumenthal refers to the whole shebang - the organization that manages the Belk, as well as the Booth (in the same structure as the Belk), and a handful of others around town to boot - even some not uptown!\n\nWith that in mind, the most popular is surely the Belk because it is the largest and most prominent, but that does not make it the best. Some of the smaller venues are actually much better for seeing a show. The Booth may be one of the best places to see a show in town, and the McGlohon is a great space converted from a former church - it's tough to match anywhere.\n\nMake sure you check out the various spaces and recognize that the name Blumenthal means more than just the big theater uptown.	1
Ri-Ra's is an Irish Pub and Restaurant that becomes a popular nightlife spot in Uptown Charlotte after dinner hours.  The food is good for the price level, and eating on the 2nd floor patio which looks onto the Hearst  plaza is a great experience during the warmer months.  At night Ri-Ra's has live music and a DJ which alternate floors depending on the night.  The bartenders are excellent, the atmosphere fun, and the drinks strong.  A great place to go to have a few drinks with drink specials every night of the week and a great place to grab a meal with specials depending on the time of day.  Cover for guys is $5 on the weekends, free for girls.	1
I normally HATE chain Irish pubs, but this particular one is a cut way above the rest.  \n\nGreat food, very very nice staff, a perfectly poured pint of Guinness, and great (meaning talented and not obnoxious) Irish/Scottish entertainment.	1
not your average Irish pub... on the weekends it can get packed... and upstars they have a DJ or band and it can get a lil crazy... on big nights it is hard to move beacuse of so many pople but i guess it is like that everywhere in CLT... i have never eaten there food... but have heard it is ok...	1
Definitely a great Irish pub!  I was a little disappointed that the downstairs is completely all smoking tables since that seems to be where it is the liveliest but in all reality, it wasn't that smoky so we ended up eating downstairs anyway.  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie which was veryyy good, definitely recommend it!  The decor is very authentic and could definitely see this place getting pretty crowded later on at night since the upstairs and downstairs are really not that big.  However, would recommend it as a place to check out if you are visiting Charlotte!	1
Great irish pub. Interior is great, looks like an authentic pub. They've got great food. Service is pretty good as well. Like most bars in Charlotte it's filled with smokers but that's par for the course in NC. Two levels, downstairs looks more the irish pub part. They typically have entertainment in some form either upstairs or down. Definitely worth a stop for a pint of Guinness!	1
Civilized, respectable locations don't charge separate covers for the gander and the goose.  Yes, it's that simple.  \n\nWell, Ri-Ra, I used to be a fan of your Irish authenticity, in terms of a cozy, low-key beer every now and then.  But seems you have taken a turn away from legitimacy, and towards masses of drunken revelrers.  A shame, really, for my once favorite bar in Charlotte.	0
The food looks great so I'd definitely try it again for lunch or dinner.  But it's a tiny space, even with the upstairs, so don't go on weekends if you don't like being mauled to death by overly tan twenty somethings in polo shirts.	0
Over-crowded, nothing special	0
When I walked into this place I felt like I was walking into my dad's favorite bar in my hometown.  It was very casual and laid back, with the big wooden chairs and comfortable atmosphere.  The food was about the same as the bar back home too.   Good but not spectacular.  It tasted very fresh and well cooked, but pub food is rarely worth getting too excited about.  The waitress was very attentive and took good care of us.  She really wanted us to have a good time.	1
We stopped in here for a drink on a Friday night.  One of the more authentic irish pubs i've been to.  The decor had a nice Irish feel and they had a band going at it upstairs(another example, they pronounce Smithwicks properly, if you don't understand, just ask an irishman)\n\nThey charged a $5 cover, ladies were free.  \nThe place was pretty hoppin, lots of drunk girls having a blast.\n\nWe pulled up to the bar and had a few drinks.  A nice selection at a decent price.  When it comes to Irish bars I'm always a sucker for a shot of Jameson with a Guinness chaser and they didn't disappoint.\n\nIt sounded like there was alot more fun to be had upstairs(live band, dance floor etc) but we were just to tired to check it out, maybe next time.	1
"This was the most pleasant dining experience I had on my business trip to Charlotte, and of course it occurred the afternoon I was leaving. After spending a week in suburbia hell, I wanted to see if Charlotte actually had a downtown, and happily I found it, along with affordable parking. We were super hungry, so we literally stepped into the first place that served food once we got out of the car. Luckily it was Ri Ra. I hear this is a rocking place on the weekend, but on a cold Tuesday afternoon, we pretty much had the place to ourselves (except for the loudmouth \""screenwriter\"" at the bar). We sat by the fireplace and enjoyed Harp on tap and sandwiches. My pastrami was delicious, but if I could do it again I would have the full serving of the magnificent mac n' cheese. The lunch menu was extensive with very reasonable prices. The best thing about this place however was our waiter, who is getting married in Jackson Square down here in NOLA this August, bless his heart. He was super nice and attentive with zero fakiness. Best of luck to you, kind sir!"	1
a sports bar galore\ncold french fries make me so sad\neighteen dollars gone	0
Went in to meet some friends who'd come in from out of town.  Lovely place, admittedly - the restoration after the fire is impressive.  When we arrived, the hostess, when she finally quit talking on her phone, couldn't find our reservation and seemed pretty snotty about it.  We went upstairs, found our people, and spent the next two hours trying to get the attention of the bartenders, to little avail.  The music was too loud for conversation.\n\nSummary: VERY noisy, terrible service.  I'd tell you about the food, but the food we ordered never arrived.  Wild dogs couldn't drag me back.	0
Last time I went it was about 3pm on a weekday and there were 3 guys sitting at the bar Ttalking with a male bartender.  I stood there for approx 5-7 mins before I was even acknowledged.  Needless to say, they haven't gotten any more of my business	0
Here's a big hint: on Mondays, the burgers are half priced if you eat in!  They grind their meat in house so you can get them as rare as you like.  I strongly recommend getting the hand cut chips, they are light years better than the regular fries.  The burgers are huge, crumbly and messy, like a good hand made burger should be and they have a few different kinds, a friend had the lamb burger and said it was outstanding.	1
Ri Ra is a pretty good size Irish pub in the First Ward downtown Charlotte. I stopped in for a quick solo lunch and was surprised to see so many free tables. If Ri Ra was near my office in Chicago, it would be packed at lunch time. \n\nThe hostess and server were both extremely nice. The hostess told me that all the wood and furnishings were brought over from Ireland when Ri Ra was built. It's a pretty big place, 2 floors, with a large bar and lots of tables. \n\nI was craving a burger but I had been told that I should have brisket while in Charlotte. Since I always do what I'm told, I went with the Wiltshire Patty, a delicious brisket sandwich. The brisket was very good, but the sweet potato tater tots were even better. Sweet potato tater tots. I'm now on a mission to find some of these in Chicago. \n\nFriendly service and sweet potato tater tots, what more can you ask for?	1
Hoegaarden on tap\nWhen you're in an Uptown mood\nRi Ra is the bomb	1
Went here during speed street for a drink with some friends so it was likely not a typical night, but we had a great time. The ambiance upstairs was great though the cover band was loud so we chose to sit outside. The balcony had a decent view and  it was a bit smoky but not too unbearable (and I'm the kind of guy who doesn't usually mind it).\n\nEveryone I saw seemed to be having a good time, which is always a great sign, and if I lived in Charlotte I'm pretty certain I'd be here regularly.	1
Not cool enough to hang out at the pub, but grabbed a sandwich from the shop extension they got during lunch.  Abnormally high 4 stars from me, but today at lunch it was just amazing.  The weather was right, I was in a good mood and hungry.\n\nGot wheat roll, dijon mustard, salami, swiss, some vegetables and banana peppers.  All tasted great and it was unfair because I got my favorite meat and cheese with perfect other stuff in sandwich.  Little pricey came to a little over seven bones, but whatevs.\n\nLooking forward to washing my car, pumping some jams in the ride, getting a fresh haircut post-gym/tan/laundry. Maybe then I'll be cool enough for the pub.\n\ndmo out	1
I was fairly unimpressed with my food at Ri Ra... I ordered the lamb burger, which consisted of an under seasoned, overly large portion of ground lamb with a bit of feta on a bun.\n\nRi Ra redeems itself a bit with a nice pub atmosphere. Although... a more unique selection of Irish brews would be a nice improvement.	0
This review is geared specifically towards their lunch time fare.  I was looking for a new place to put into rotation and dropped in here a few weeks back.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it much to the liking of a Subway but refined and truly fresher ingredients.  The service was ok, not really over excited to serve but I imagine that's because this place gets really packed so they stick to the business at hand.  I got there around 11:30am and any later I would have been in line with about 20 other people.  This place gets packed!  Of course a couple other good things about this location is that if the weather is good there isn't a much better patio for eating then right there outside, out front of Hearst Tower.  Also they have a loyalty card which is always a good thing!	1
Can't rate the food but we had an excellent time at Ri Ra!  Great service behind the bar on a busy Friday night! Thanks to all!	1
My fish and chips were really pretty good. I got the regular size and the piece of fish I got was enormous. I can only imagine how huge an actual large would be.	1
Been here twice; both times it was an awful experience. In both cases, the trouble started with the hostess, continued through poor/nonexistent service. On this occasion, there was a cover for the privilege of listening to a lousy cover band playing tired seventies tunes in a room with terrible acoustics--apparently without a soundboard--and putting down money on overpriced drinks, surrounded by frat boys, guidos, and gold diggers in addition to the aforementioned problems. I'd write a more entertaining review, but honestly it's not worth the effort.	0
A Charlotte classic hang out :)	1
"I understand everyplace has its rules. My friends had a pre-wedding party here. And at 10pm it becomes a \"" standing bar\"" only. But did your staff have to be rude to the parents who were still sitting down a little respect goes a long way. We will not be going back."	0
"I came here for \""brunch\"" before having to board a flight home. \n\nI got the Holy Grail Ale and the Breakfast Burger. The ale was tasty and the burger was quite good.  Though I would warn anyone that if you're going to go for this burger make sure your stomach is empty, skip breakfast, go in starving.  This burger is the biggest thing I have ever eaten in one sitting! But, oh my, it was tasty. The kind of clog your arteries good. I don't think I needed to eat again that day. \n\nThe only complaint I had was that the service was a little slow for me given I had a flight to catch and mentioned it to my server."	1
Apparently, reservations are not valued here.  We had a reservation for 7 and were told it would be a 20 min. wait.  Walked over to Harvest Moon Grille and had lunch instead.  Wish I could have reviewed the food...	0
The large employee guy with blonde hair was belligerent and trying to start fights with several us last night. He needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made.	0
I have always heard good things about Ri Ra's but my experience was nothing spectacular.  Ri Ra's is a decently sized (2 medium sized rooms) Irish bar is downtown Charlotte next door to Prohibition.  My group stopped in Ri Ra's to meet up with a few others and I was not impressed.  \n\nAfter paying one of the most unjustified $5 covers of my life, I walked in and felt like I had just stepped in to an Ivy League frat party.  Suits, sport coats, and even tuxedos everywhere but this bar was nothing to dress up for.  The general vibe in this place was very uppity and i had several unpleasant interactions with people.  \n\nA DJ (who was actually pretty good) was playing blaring house music.  I normally would have really enjoyed the music but the crowd at Ri Ra's on this night couldn't have cared less about the music.  Dancing almost seemed frowned upon based upon what I saw.  Not saying that a few bad eggs are representative of the entire bar but on this particular night, Ri Ra's did not live up to expectations.	0
Went for lunch with a group of girls from work. Waitress was completely overwhelmed. She had too many tables and I didn't see a manager out helping her once. We ordered our food at 12:15 and asked where our food was 12:45. Didn't get our food until after 1. I had a meeting and told the waitress to nix my order. She came out with orders and dropped the tray as she was handing out food. 2 people didn't get their food and the other 4 had to get to go boxes. Food isn't good either. Changes need to be made. I have never had a good experience here.	0
Came here with a friend for lunch and sat on the roof top deck. Aces for that! We started with the fried pickle. Love FP, but these were a poor representation of them. Greasy and the batter was peeling off. I had the brisket with sweet potato, oh! That's right. I didn't get what I ordered. I over cooked greasy fries like everyone else. The brisket was very good thought. It had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it. The meat was a bit over cooked. It was a beautiful day to hand with friends on the sunny deck!	0
I went to RiRa for dinner on a Saturday night and it was surprisingly good. My husband and I sat at the long bar, while a fire roared behind us and the NFL playoffs were shown on the one television.  \n\nI rarely order burgers but was enticed by the Guinness BBQ Burger, figuring that it would be impossible not to pair well with my frothy pint of Guinness. I don't usually order burgers since they rarely meet my high expectations of a well seasoned, juicy, not-too-big-but-not-too-small beef patty, but RiRa delivered on all counts. I scarfed the burger, leaving little room for the good, but not great fries. My husband was very happy with his burger, which was some sort of super-spicy special and apparently left his mouth satisfyingly aflame. \n\nWe'll be back!	1
Stopped in after the theater for a pint, but could not get served. We sat down at one of the tables ( more or less stood by it because it needed cleaning) & waited for a server. One did walk by our table to grab the tip from the table behind us, then walked back by our table, but we were invisible. I then asked the bartender if we needed to place our order with her & take it back to the table, but she said servers were on the floor & they would take our order. So, we again waited & never did see a server. We gave up & went elsewhere for our nightcap.	0
Granted time is of the essence, but the Staff at RiRa handled our group of 19 on a thirsty Thursday evening with ease!  Don't let uptown parking scare you away from crashing this party, with the Discovery Place parking deck just blocks away RiRa is very accessible for those not living Uptown.	1
One of my first experiences in uptown when I moved here...what a great Irish pub not to mention the food is out of this world...definitely recommend	1
I just went through the line at the sandwich shop in the courtyard of the Hearst Tower.  The sandwich/ salad makers were polite and fast, and the price was reasonable for downtown.  The salad looks like it could be good, but there is no way for me to know because they were out of utensils.   How can a place that makes salads to go be out of utensils?  And the worst part is that you don't know it until you already through the line and have paid.  They should let people know before they pay.  The guy at the register made no apology or attempt to find some way to provide something to eat with.  Now sitting at my desk with a salad that I can't eat, gotta give it one star for the poor service.	0
We visited this pub on our first trip to Charlotte. The Guinness Stew and Potato Cakes were very tasty. Our server was friendly and fast. Our beers were never empty before we had a refill. Great place!	1
(Only commenting on Ri Ra as a bar as I have not tried the food) Get some more staff! This place is terribly understaffed, on a Friday night there should not be only 2 bartenders for a packed bar. Easily takes 10 min to get a drink. I like the space and the patio but it means nothing if I can't get a drink.	0
Came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner. I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. I expected a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes, it was busy but the bartenders were on top of it. They seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly. I was very impressed. The drink prices seems on par for what you would expect  as well. I liked it and the atmosphere of the bar.	1
Just had an Angus beef blue cheese burger with onions mushrooms and cheese that was out of this world.	1
Was visiting from Chicago and this place rivals any of the best Irish pubs out there. The ambiance is great, with the traditional wood paneling everywhere. Plenty of tvs for us to watch the games. We came in for a late brunch and it's was so delicious. My coffee came in it's own French press (which I will now buy for myself) and the breakfast sandwich had bangers, ham, cheese, bacon and egg on a toasted brioche bun. I made everyone at the table try it! If I ever happen to be in Charlotte again, I won't move from that bar. Haha better than epicenter!	1
This review is of their Ri Ra Sandwhich shop around the corner since there is no separate listing for this shop. Stopped here because I've never been before, so I ordered the old faithful Reuben. Pretty hard to screw up, right? Well they managed to serve me a sandwhich that was barely eatable as the corned beef in it was like leather....very hard and chewy. The sandwhich was small. For $9 I'd expect a LOT more. The Rose Sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would expect. Not a very good sandwhich.\n\nService was iffy at best. The young lady behind the counter was very nice and personable, but the other two seemed like they didn't want to be there...aloof is the appropriate term.\n\nThe ONLY saving grace were the Keogh's Dubliner Irish Cheese and Onion Potato Crisps imported from Ireland. If this place is going to rely on packaged potato chips to save them they won't be in business long.\n\nSo a SMALL sandwhich, chips and a 20oz bottle of diet coke set me back $14 with tip. That is a LOT for a LESS than adequate sandwhich. I will not be coming back.\n\nNOT recommended!	0
Lights too low, music too loud, not many people inside, drinks too expensive. Plus it costs 5$ just to get in. Def not worth it. Try some where else!	0
Went here for a corporate dinner. Had the finger sandwiches (chicken, pulled pork, and something else), chips and spinach dip, lobster cakes, and potato cakes. \n\nOnly tried the pulled pork, which was good, but others said the chicken sandwich disappointed. Lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo.\n\nSpinach dip the only saving grace. Oh, and their lemon bar dessert.	0
Superb service and reliably fine food from this family owned restaurant. Briskly busy at lunchtime, relaxed at night, always comfortable. A pleasure!	1
Tasty appetizers and dishes. Pungent sauces. Quick delivery. Excellent choice for Chinese food in Charlotte.	1
Great food, beautiful environment. Not super authentic but as far as Americanized Chinese food goes this place was super good. Also lots of veggie options and sizable quantities.	1
I'd say this is one of the more consistent lunch places in uptown. I usually get the dynasty noodles with a side hot sauce and the food always comes out pretty quickly. I guess they've got to keep the food moving since there's always a crowd during lunch hour. I wouldn't say that it's the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it definitely is one of the best Chinese places in Charlotte.	1
I had carryout. Very quick but kinda confusing to find the place. I was expecting good things because the reviews seem to rave about this place but honestly I was really disappointed. The food is mediocre, I have had WAY better and I can't say that anything I had was really that great. I'll be looking for a different chinese place to eat at.	0
I have had Chinese food in a bunch of different cities, including NYC and San Francisco to name a few. So far I have not found a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. If you go to Soho for pick up don't follow their address to the T because it is actually on the other side of the building next to Fuel Pizza. Call ahead when you are about 5 minutes away and they will come outside to deliver your food. As far as the food goes, the dumplings are a little too doughy but the sauce is quite good. I would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland. I am not going to X this place out just yet I may give it another shot. Still looking for a good Chinese Food place here in Charlotte wish me luck!	0
This is some of the best Chinese delivery I've ever had, and I've gotten delivery in Soho, NYC before! A bit pricey for delivery, but after you have a bite you'll know why. Scrumptious! Quick delivery too!	1
"It is my opinion there are no good Chinese restaurants Uptown, and Soho Bistro continues to prove me right.\n\nI have been here two or three times now, and I tend to order the more \""authentic,\"" or less popular items such as the beef noodle soup, Japanese ramen, and they have both let me down.\n\nAlso, whenever I come here for dinner I am literally the only customer in the dining area. I think that Soho Bistro must really be only a lunch place."	0
Awesome! Went for dinner last night with a group of four.  Two chicken dishes, two shrimp dishes: Sesame shrimp, Szechuan shrimp, Honey Lemon Chicken, Tangerine Chicken.  The flavors were amazing, but I hate eating dark meat.  I'm deducting a star for that.  We had a great little server and we couldn't have been happier!!! We will be back for sure.	1
Food is decent, but service is no good. I was here before a couple of years and did not want to go back because of the service. Unfortunately, went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service. I know I won't make the same mistake again!	0
The service was good and the food came out very soon after we ordered. The menu is extensive and has many different options of Thai and Chinese dishes. The menu offers anything from soup to noodle dishes to stir fry. I ordered their spicy soup with shrimp and it was very good and actually spicy and had a lot of veggies in it. The restaurant itself is but small but went during the week and it wasn't crowded at all! I would definitely eat here again and it's very close to the arena!	1
"This is located in the heart of downtown. Food is average and service is not bad. Will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 PM. But take out is very fast. \n\nI have been going here for past 7 years and one thing that sucks big time is the two Cantonese women who manages this place.  They have no idea what is a good service in a restaurant means. They are rude. Literally rude. Half the time you don't understand what they speak in English. No in this restaurant are polite. They serve food as if they are serving people in homeless place. And they never treat you as patrons by the way. \n\nAm I eating and dining there ? \""No\"". I am try taking out? \""Yes\""\n\nLocation : 4/5\nAmbience: 3/5\nService: 2/5\nFood: 2.5/5"	0
Excellent food and excellent service. Wait staff is always very attentive, constantly refilling drinks, etc. Lunch rush does make for a bit of a wait, but there are only so many tables. Highly recommended.	1
We stayed at the Holiday Inn Center City for a trip and happened to visit Soho Bistro for dinner on a rainy evening. The restaurant is clean, well laid out and appealing. The staff was exceptionally friendly and our waiter was a young man who was very eager to please. Unfortunately, the food was sub-par. The egg roll and scallion pancakes were hot and tasty, but our entrees were disappointing. I ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but I have a shellfish allergy. They corrected the error, but when the chicken was served, it was burned and it was clear that the veggie garnishes were transferred from one plate to the other. My dinner companion ordered noodles which he described as tasting like watered down spaghetti with weak curry sauce. I can't stress how nice the people were, but the food portion could use a visit from Kitchen Nightmares.	0
I've been going to this place for a few years now, and every time I go it loses another star and another chance. It used to be the best place to get Chinese food but recently it has gotten really gross. Today was the last straw. I got the Steamed Chicken Dumplings and a order of Edamame to go. The dumplings had no taste other than salt,  the dough was so think and chewy I didn't eat my last two. The worst part were the soy beans. Half of them rotten, no salt, no seasonings, just plan nasty and I tossed about half of the order. Come on guys I know you can do better!	0
Have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on? Enough said. If I must give you more reason why you can skip this place, the food is completely commercialized and forgettable, and the there is not a whole lot going on here. You are far better off at Stool Pigeons or even Cans.	0
"Can you say, \""Ug?\"" So, there are lots of TVs and there was the same game on, for all 40 sets. This seemed quite bizarre. Also, why have 4 screens when you can have one huge one? Why advertise fresh squeezed lemonade, when it's from a package? Why give french fries with most of them burned? Why not have a vegetarian burger in addition to all the artery clogging ones? The reason for the one star, was that our waitress was cool and very courteous."	0
Lack of Atmosphere (Even during sporting events)\n\nFood is terrible.\n\nBartender/Waitress were incredibly rude....\n\nEverybody has bad days, they should not be this bad.....	0
So, I don't know WHY we decided to stop into this sports bar for some lunch during our Charlotte trip, oh wait, yes I do remember. It's because we were starving to death and sick of walking in the 100 degree weather. \n\nAnyway, I still regret stopping in as I'm sure there are a million better places in the area to go. The service was terrible, granted we think the guy may have been new, but it was overall awkward and just odd. I don't really want a side of 'uncomfortable' with my mushroom swiss burger. (I also don't want to be asked what kind of cheese I want on my mushroom SWISS burger). \n\nPricing was a little high, food was decent, service was pretty bad but more than anything I'm just mad at myself that I didn't do a bit more research. Definitely should have found a local lunch gem that would have satisfied my appetite and need for a great cultural experience. There's always next time.	0
Found a long black hair in my burger. The buns were cold the meat patty was overcooked (asked for medium) and very thin. The side salad was decent, the tea tasted like crap and the food took foreeeeever to come. The waitress shifted from friendly to rude and then back I was thinking about asking her if she had a evil twin sister or something.	0
"Oy.  Why do I do this to myself.\n\nThe service was fine, but nothing about the food was edible.  First of all, five dollars for stale tortilla chips and \""homemade\"" salsa (clearly from a can).\n\nThe chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber.  \n\nIt's my fault, I guess."	0
Shame on me for not consulting Yelp prior to going here but I was uptown with my 6 y/o and she was in charge of finding somewhere to eat and chose this spot.  \n\nThe service was fine, place was empty because it was early so if the service had been bad I would have been even less impressed.\n\nThe kids menu was quite pathetic AND expensive!  $6.00 for two small hamburgers? And when I say small I'm talking like half dollar size burgers...thus the reason we followed up dinner at TCBY (silver lining :)!)\n\nI had the Thai beef salad and it had about 6 strips of beef.  Definition of strip = about 3 inches long and 1/4 inch wide...again pathetic.  Flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else.\n\nMy advice....avoid it and keep it movin!	0
I only gave them 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. Food was mediocre (fries were cold), and we haven't seen our waitress in 45 minutes (writing this review while waiting to ask for the check). I'll write another review tomorrow if I'm still here waiting.	0
This is a sports bar off the lobby of the Marriott Center City in Charlotte, NC. This is not a big place, but laid out to be a sports bar with a lot of monitors. Went here a night during final four (Basket Ball). The bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive. They have a good selection of beer (however their dispenser of draft was out of service). How can you have a bar with no draft beer? I got a Sam Adams (in a bottle). Tried their Philly Cheese Steak. That is probably the worst Philly cheese steak I have had in my life (and I used to live in Philadelphia). The meat was burnt, the onions were fried beyond belief and the cheese was very greasy. The fries were OK. \n\nIn summary a great location, great server, beer so-so and food not up to par.  Sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook.	0
"As for a place to spend money uptown I'd skip it.  The bar is ok, the food is ok, it's nothing special. It's a convenience sort of thing, I'd imagine if I was in from out of town and looking for something quick to eat, a place to shoot the bull, and I was staying upstairs in the Marriott I would be ok with it.  The only reason I give it a measly 2 stars is because there are better options all around, this sort of competition should have been motivation to update the menu and decor. \n\nMy best experience here:  We used it for a Sunday brunch my family put on during our wedding weekend.  For that experience the food was great, the service was excellent, but that is not their \""normal\"" operation.  \n\nI guess if it's raining out and you are stuck and have no place to go I'd check it out. But under any other circumstances you'd probably get a better meal by walking a half block in any direction."	0
When I first moved here in 1995 this and Ri Ra was the only 2 places downtown. I said to myself, why the hell the I move here.  Charlotte has grown.  This place is a regular guy beer and wing joint.  It is affordable, not stuffy and you can kick back and be yourself.  The prices are reasonable.  Darryhl is a nice lady and a great barttender	1
A friend from Chapel Hill came to visit us yesterday and we decided to take him to downtown Charlotte. Since most locations were closed, we decided to stop at Champions, it was either that or Hooters. The environment seemed so uninviting, I was the only female in the room, but its a sports bar so whatever. We all ordered food from their ridiculously priced menu. Food quality, meh. I ordered the BLT which was about $10. When my food came out, the chicken was cold. It tasted like it was refrigerated from days ago. The only thing I liked was their ranch sauce. The bar was noisy for only a few guys being there and there were TV's everywhere! It was kind of uncomfortable.	0
Went in for a couple drinks and food. It was so slow that I actually asked one of the employees if they were closing. With that being said, drinks came out pretty fast but that was it... waited about 15 minutes for the bartender to take our order which we cashed out and moved on to another place to eat. There were more employees in the restaurant than guests, and ironically there were a couple of them enjoying a meal, at a table in the Dining room, in front of customers who couldn't even order an appetizer in a reasonable time. No management present that we could see. Seems like a place that has given up.	0
Everytime I travel to Charlotte and stay at the Marriott City Center I visit Champions. Consistency builds trust. Trust is how a business thrives. The cheese fries are a must but add jalape\u00f1os and get an ice cold draft; some great selections are available. \nThe service is always so friendly and outgoing!!\nLove all the options to catch the latest in sports entertainment!	1
Great food, friendly attentive staff.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came for lunch around 11:30am.  There were only a few people in the restaurant; however, the bartender was very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Grilled chicken BLT and it was very tasty.  My boyfriend ordered the Thai Beef Salad and I tried the beef and it was amazing.  He said the salad was great!\n\nSince we were staying at The Marriott, we came back around 11pm after seeing a movie and the bar was full.  The bartenders were friendly.  I had the Peach Margarita which was delicious but was a little heavy on the peach.  My boyfriend had the Triple C Rail Pale Ale.  It's a decent local beer.	1
I'm really starting to rack up those Marriott points now.  I can't even remember all the Marriott's I've stayed at, but I do remember all the good ones.  This one is definitely in the top 10.  The location couldn't be better, and although the building seems a little old, the rooms were typical of the more modern Marriotts.  What put this one over the top was the Concierge Lounge on the 18th floor.  Most lounges are simple, bare-bones and offer only just enough.  The lady who ran this did a wonderful job of keeping things stocked and clean.  She even made a pretty good smoothie (healthy too) and offered plenty of fruit for breakfast.  They even had San Pellegrino.  Too bad Kristin wasn't there to take it all.\n\n4 stars for the best Concierge Lounge of all the Marriotts I've been.  The rest of the hotel is basic and room service did an adequate job.  The normal rate (over $200) is a little price, but the location is very central.\n\nValet = $18, self-park = $12	1
I stayed here for a corporate holiday party that was held in their large ballroom and really enjoyed myself. The rooms were satisfactory and the suites were great for post-party gathering. The event itself was beautiful and the food was really great. I really liked the event space layout and the staff was phenomenal. Best of all, the hotel is so centrally located that we were able to walk to all the places we needed to go the next morning. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Charlotte.	1
This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are good enough. The staff is friendly and there is a fantastic restaurant located in the lobby. So, why only 2 stars you ask? I'm traveling on business, like many people who come to this town, and I cannot come close to expressing my frustration with the wireless internet. ...........................\n\nLet me take a moment to calm myself.\n\n\nIt's horrible. Paying per device seems silly when it's not uncommon for people to have a few devices, but that's not my biggest issue. My complaint is that I'm having to refresh my wireless connection every 3 minutes on my iPad. It's absolutely maddening. I wouldn't be as concerned if I were here for pleasure. The ability to work from my room is pretty critical when traveling on business. I've never had connection issues on my device, so I'm confident it's not the problem. Over the past two nights, I have spent more time waiting on/refreshing my connection than actual productive time online.	0
Really nice hotel close to everything in the uptown area. Most importantly it's away from the noise in the evening.Walk one block to all of the bars on the ave or Epic center. Epic Center area is really loud at night which makes this hotel ideal since its one block away from the noise	1
What's that smell?\nNot sure if it is me but the rooms in that hotel have a weird smell very noticeable when I show up on Sundays. Some kind of wet used socks flavor ... I guess I get used to it and get less affected the rest of the week. \nBesides that, nothing really fancy or weird about that hotel ... just another full service Marriott. The breakfast for those with lounge access is pretty good though and the attendant is really nice! I like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday.\nA big thank to the night shift for going the extra mile and moving us to a conference room and providing refreshments after seeing us struggling in the lobby at 2AM trying to complete a deliverable while they were cleaning up.	0
I recently stayed here because the conference I was attending was held here. In terms of accommodations -- this place was very nice! The rooms were spotless and the housekeeping service was just great. I have to say, the staff really went out of their way to make sure everything was smooth, from check-in to check-out. (They even have a luggage service, attended by helpful staff.)\n\nThe hotel was in a great part of town too -- it was within walking distance of Epicentre which has a lot of restaurants.\n\nIf I were in the area again, I'd definitely consider staying here again.	1
Three friends & I [all in our twenties] stayed in a hotel room here overnight. The decor is beautiful, and the service was quick and easy. The concierge gave us free covers into the local bars at the epicentre so be sure to ask. The room was beautiful, the beds were comfortable, and it was a great price to stay downtown. It was a great hotel experience!	1
I had such high hopes! The person who greeted me was wonderful and took care of my large bag and car. But my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak. In the hall there are mops and vacuums. Not a good sign. Is it tomorrow yet when I get to check out? This place is not worth the price!	0
This Marriott is in a great location if you have business in downtown Charlotte and they have done a good job of keeping it up to date and providing value for the money. Parking is not the greatest, but this is downtown in a major city.	1
Only 2 stars for location. Rooms are humid and smell like wet dog. Worst hotel I have yet to stay in as a consultant.	0
"Charlotte Marriott city center is a nice hotel located in the perfect part of downtown. They have a decent sports bar and a good restaurant with reasonable \""hotel restaurant\"" prices.\n\nMany decent clubs and high-end restaurants are within walking distance.\n\nThe rooms are comfortable with a large desk for working. +lots of plugs\n\nShower is hot, a good thing, and towels are soft and fresh. (I only mention this because some hotels have a strange chemical smell on their towels after being washed)\n\nFriendly, southern staff"	1
Very comfortable hotel. The front desk staff is always so nice. I have hosted several meetings here and the complete experience has always been favorable. From in-room dining to restaurant options you will not go hungry. \nWalking distance to many great places through out downtown Charlotte. \nI always sleep like a a baby.	1
I booked this hotel for the 2014 ACC Championship game. I thought that this hotel, as a host hotel for the game, would offer options for dinner after the game. Wow, I was wrong. We got back around midnight to a line st the only open restaurant where we heard last call was most likely before we could sit down. We decided to try room service... What a mistake. I called the front desk and was told they stopped room service at 11. Wow, 11 closure on a night when they knew most guest would not get back until later. I talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all. His answer was to order pizza. I found all of this very unacceptable. I'm a Platinum Member of the Marriott Rewards program, but I can say I will not stay here again after the lack of preparation they had for game that started at 8:00 pm.	0
We love the Marriott because they are usually in great locations and are clean. They belong to a nice corporation. \n\nWe only stayed at this Marriott for a night. Checked in around 11pm. The guest service was awesome as usual. The room a/c didn't feel cool enough but granted we came from Northern Virginia where heat wasn't turned on at night. But it's a perfect location. Within a couple blocks of restaurants and bars. We will definitely be staying here on weekend getaways again.	1
Stayed only one night for the Belk Bowl and it was a comfortable & good night. The hotel is very nice & the reps were all hospitable. It is always a relief to be met with a genuine smile when I get to my destination. Our room was clean & comfortable. I slept like a baby & didn't notice any city noise on 10th floor. Breakfast was delicious. I had the traditional French toast...so yummy! Thank you Marriott for another good experience.	1
The Light Factory is awesome. It puts on very cool photography exhibits and has a variety of educational programs for digital and film photography for teens and adults. One example: The Light Factory did an amazing photo and art exhibit on post-Katrina New Orleans after taking a group of high school photography students on a trip there.	1
This place has some wonderful sandwiches. I work in the building next door so I frequent most of the dowtown (or as they call it uptown) establishments during the week.  They offer Boar's Head and normally offer a daily or weekly special.  This place gets a 2 b/c they have the worst customer service, the unfriendliest staff, and got a 94.5 on cleaniness rating. Although the sandwiches are good its not worth having some lady bark at you for your order before you can even see the menu.  They need to hire some people that can smile.	0
Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and I am happy I did. The store front and decor are completely ordinary, but don't be put off by the lack ambiance. My waiter could not have been more pleasant and yet not overbearing at all. He greeted cheerfully and invited me to choose a table.\n\nI received a complimentary salad of crispy fresh lettuce with ginger dressing. A tasty treat to start. I ordered a spicy yellow tail and spider roll which were both well made and tasty. The rice was done perfectly and the sauces complimented the rolls nicely. \n\nThe price was very reasonable. My lunch with salad and two rolls was $ 14.42.\n\nI've been looking for good sushi in Charlotte and have not been able to find it too often. Today, I did. A definite keeper. I will be back!	1
Very tasty!  We always get the vegetable tempora because its hard to find good vegetable tempora.  It really is outstanding!  The house made ginger sauce on the salad is amazing as well!  Sometimes the service is a little... non existant.  Had to wait a while to get the check. They brought boxes and we waited about 15 minutes after that for the check. There were only 2 other customers in the restaurant.	1
When my favorite silk blouse had a run-in with a particularly evil soap dispenser, I knew my regular dry cleaner wouldn't cut it. Nicole W. recommended Eden Cleaners, so I rushed right over. Three days and $7 later, I was reunited with my blouse, looking as good as new. Aaaand, I promptly spilled carnitas and salsa down the front. And once again, Rosa gets my blouse back to me, looking like it had never stepped foot in a Mexican restaurant.\n\nThe best part, every time I stop in, Rosa tells me I'm pretty. Customer for life!	1
"I don't trust Eden Cleaners. \n\nI used their online service to pick up my laundry. For three days no one called or picked up the clothes. After several calls, I finally spoke to someone. Clothes were picked up and returned. Their service was fine.\n\nWhat bothers the snot out of me is that no one answers the phone as \""Eden Cleaners\"". After they say, \""hello?\"" I have to ask if I've reached Eden cleaners. I can deal with the very broken English, but I can't deal with the non-conventional ways of answering the phone or doing business online.\n\nWhile it's more expensive to have the clothes done at the hotel, at least I know that they'll get done."	0
I went to this cleaner for convenience. What a mistake it was. They absolutely destroyed my favorite dress. It went in perfectly fine and came out pink! The woman told me it was not her problem and that they weren't a magic shop! Absolutely terrible service. I have had the dress cleaned before with absolutely no problem. Use at your own risk.	0
City Tavern is an attractive restaurant in the heart of uptown Charlotte. They boast a nice menu with a great seafood selection, so we gave it a shot. For starters, we went here on a Saturday night at 8pm and were practically the only ones inside, which is never a good sign. I ordered a mojito, which was really good and refreshing - one of my favorite parts of our experience there. \n\nI ordered the seabass and it really wasn't anything spectacular. This is definitely one of those restaurants that gets the job done, it is clean and the food is OK, but I would probably wouldn't think to go here when looking for a good restaurant on a Saturday night. If you do head over, look for my second favorite part of our experience, our waiter. He was so cool and absolutely hysterical!! I can't remember his name, but look for the guy who looks like Dave Chappelle. You'll get dinner and a show.	0
Okay, seriously I do live close by, but the food is pretty decent here and I really like the double deck outdoor seating when its not too hot.  Good draught beer and we never seem to have to wait too long.  \n\nTry the ahi app and the blackened seafood for dinner.	1
I visited Charlotte and decided to go here, cause it was crowded. The wait was 35-50 minutes. I really didn't know what to choose --- so i end up ordering Beer Battered Fish and Chips (os os) and the ribs and chicken combo w/ fries (os os). There was nothing really special about the food. Charlotte doesn't have much to offer when it comes to food =P	0
"Ate here the other night and would TOTALLY go back. Very spacious, awesome bar and outdoor seating available. I had the Hawaiin Chicken dish - you have to try this, it was incredible! They chicken was so juicy and cooked perfectly, with pineapple sauce on top and rice pilaf underneath. I am craving it again as I type this. It is also very cool to walk into a place and order your beer by saying \""red, ale, amber, port\"" etc. I will definitely be back."	1
"Stopped by here during a recent swing through Charlotte on biz. I was looking for an relaxed \""Pub-food-plus\"" type of joint with good beer and in Rock Bottom, I found it. \n\nThe bar staff was helpful and generous with samples from their 8ish original beers. The Brown Ale is delicious (and award winning) and my favorite of the group.\n\nWhile Rock Bottom features beer, they hang their hat on food. The nachos were loaded with fixin's, and the chili is chunky and decidedly above-average. \n\nIt's a relaxed, inviting and warm destination for anyone looking for an afterwork drink or evening out."	1
Nothing here really blew me away..  Yeah, it's pretty cool that they brew their own beers and they are located on Tryon but... eh.  This spot is one step above an Applebees.  Dont get me wrong, I kinda like Applebees.  Just dont expect anything amazing.  I would suggest sitting outside and enjoying a nice day.  That might make it a little better.  I would also suggest you try the artichoke/crab dip.  That was rather delicious.  I would say, give it a try but know.. There are much better places in the city.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M.	0
The only really great thing I can say about Rock Bottom is their location, it was perfect right before going out on a Friday night, but that's it.  Their menu is WAY overpriced, with nothing really great on it.  I just got the nachos (found as an appetizer) and my friend got the burger.  The nachos were overcooked and semi-stale.  The beer was decent, it's just draft beer here.  Service was good and the atmosphere was fine.  But I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.	0
You'll know when you've hit it.\n\n(Ba-dum crash!)	1
Great location downtown Charlotte, nice menu and wonderful Hand Crafted Beer Selection.\n\nSports bar atmosphere with quite a few TV's located around and a few Pool Tables too.	1
"There is a wide variety of food choices here, from salads to pizza. Steaks and seafood, Mexican to Cajun. Something for everyone, and great beers on tap all brewed in house as well as bottled beers and a full bar. The servers are friendly and efficient, they know their menu. An excellent choice out side of the box is the \""Bistro filet\"", ask for the Ale sauce on the side. My all time favorite is the Shrimp and Crab tower, with avocado in it and Pita on the side."	1
This place has a fantastic outdoor patio and makes for a great place to sip back and enjoy a few beers. We split the brewer's feast and particularly enjoyed the southwest egg rolls with a roasted jalapeno ranch dressing. I enjoyed their winter seasonal and their Sweet Magnolia brown ale. However, they didn't make my top favorite beer selection and other than that I really didn't find any of their brews to be that great. Overall, I'd recommend going elsewhere with a better beer selection from multiple breweries. Of course, much of this review reflects my distaste for chain restaurants and breweries.	0
Meh, indeed.  Decent beer and excellent service. But it's chain food and it didn't do much for me.	0
My boyfriend and I went here hoping for better-than-average bar food and a good home brew while in Charlotte, but it was just meh. We were told we would wait for 20 minutes which seemed ridiculous as there were open tables all over the restaurant and bar and finally got seated in one of these open tables after 40 minutes of waiting. The $10 calamari was a very small portion, the sauces were obviously not made in-house, and the pieces of calamari were TINY! We both ordered mediocre salads and didn't find their brews to be anything special. Would have rather spent $50 elsewhere.	0
"Went here for a pre-show meal. We were looking forward to the beers, and fortunately or unfortunately (depending upon your viewpoint), that was the highlight of the meal. I ordered the ribs, which were dry and not that hot. Also they were not that tender. Their sweet sauce, however, was good, but no sauce can make up for poorly cooked ribs. My wife had the chicken pesto pasta. While that was decent, it wasn't exciting either.\n\nSure, the plates were \""sizeable.\"" But PRICEY for what you get. I mean, we could have gone to Aria Italian nearby and gotten a MUCH better quality of food for LESS than this place! I mean, we went here thinking we would get a good value. Unfortunately, it's more than a lot of other comparable places in Uptown.\n\nToo many other choices in Charlotte to come back here."	0
"Been to Rock bottom multiple times, just as always had a great time. Our server was Donna, great server and she knew a lot about the beers.\n\nThe manager was walking around checking in on tables so I asked him for his suggestion from the menu. He suggested the Chicken Parmesan pasta with the \""Smoky Mountain\"" pasta sauce and a side of marinara.\n\nIt. was. amazing. Perfect recommendation. Had a great time. We'll definitely be back."	1
"This place has a decent menu, it's executed pretty well, and they (of course) make their own beers. Too bad it's often packed to the rafters with \""former frat boy turned middling banking executives who still listen to DMB on the side\"". I'm happy to eat there if I happen to be uptown and the crowd wants to... but I try to avoid it whenever I can."	0
57 dollars for two steak meals and plenty of beer is not a bad price at all. Being in the center of downtown you would think there prices would be higher but they have some amazing choices and beers for a good price. I enjoyed there red ale more then there brown but both where great and my wife said that her kolsch was well made also. Ive been here several times and will be returning several more.	1
I have been here on numerous occasions with a variety of people and the one thing I must say about this place is inconsistency.  You can go there one night and have great food and service, whereas you could go there on a totally different night and experience the complete opposite.  The same goes for the food.  Some dishes are awesome (shrimp and grits, stuffed chicken) while others I would definitely shy away from (pizza).  If you are a beer lover, they have some good brews which are actually crafted on site.  The beer can be better than the food more times than not and I would recommend people to go here for that more than the food.  The Southern Flyer is great for pale ale folks like myself.  If you give this place a shot, prepare to roll the dice because you don't know who you will get, or what the food will be like when it comes out.  The one thing you will be guaranteed to have if you are so inclined is a nice brew made on-site.  Can't beat that sometimes...	0
Absolutely delicious! Ordered cherry glazed, hazelnut-crusted chicken. The vegs? They didn't overcook carrots! Yay! My teen ordered avocado chicken sandwich - it's BIG and avocado, were ripe and fresh! Nice service! Go. I almost died there... so was my teenager daughter (she was picky but she loved her order very much).	1
"I have mixed feelings about Rock Bottom. I enjoyed the inexpensive beer sampler. The main reason we went  here though was for my fiance to try a specific burger. Unfortunately that burger was \""86'd\""... as was her second choice. We weren't told that until 10 to 15 minutes after ordering, which delayed our dinner. Otherwise what we got was OK. We went for a second time with some friends to watch a Panthers game, and, again, it was just OK. i tried a third time and not only did our food take a long time, but it was clear that mine was made first and had just been sitting out because nothing was warm. Three strikes and you're out in my book. I will not be going back. If you do go, I recommend going when it isn't busy (as it was with my first and third experience)."	0
Beer is good, strawberry margarita is delicious!! The jalape\u00f1o pretzel bites are an appetizer worth paying for!! Wish it wasn't just seasonal, they should have it all year round! Food was so yummy! Our server Brittany was so nice and helpful! Definitely a place I would visit again :)	1
A very nice brewpub - a recent and extensive renovation provides great atmosphere.  Blue cheese bacon burger was excellent.  Their brews are very well balanced and enjoyable - something on tap for everyone.	1
Get to the Chase:\n\nPros:\n1) Fantastic ribs! Succulent, juicy, and came right off the bone\n2) Exceptional service (I think I saw our waitress spend half the time on her hands and knees wiping off crumbs and food that other customers left under their table)...I have never seen a restaurant where that happened...not only that she was always genuinely smiling and making sure we had fresh water\n3) Fantastic beer selections (would highly recommend the beer sampler)\n4) First time I actually LOVED coleslaw...perfect balance of slaw, mayo, and tangy sweetness (accented by the freshly cut slivers of apple)\n5) Desserts do equal justice to their delicious entrees\n\nCons:\n1) None	1
I wasn't impressed with this place. The menu sounds really great& the waitress suggested I get the chicken bacon Mac & cheese, but it was disappointing to say the least.	0
Go here if you enjoy waiting in the lobby when there are tons of open tables and being rudely treated by the hostess!  The food is just ok bar food.  The beer is awesome I will admit and the servers are pretty attentive.  I would rather drive down to Myrtle beach or Atlanta to it's sister restaurant Gordon Biersch.  The food is much better and the people who work there will treat you much better.  If you really need to go there to enjoy the beer, I'd eat elsewhere and then just sit at the bar.	0
3.5 stars.  Nothing special, but everything was fairly well done.  Went for a lunch meeting and had the southwest salad.  The jalapeno ranch was made in house and was great.  The baguette on the side was a nice touch.  Service was perfect: attentive but not hovering.  We were able to get in and out quickly.  Other diner thought the ahi tuna salad was good as well.  Tuna was perfectly done and contained a good sized lunch portion.  Other meals (chicken avocado sandwich and bacon cheeseburger) looked uninteresting.	1
Service is great. Outside seating in mild weather is awesome. Chicken Mac and Sausage Mac were both great. Veggie pizza was fresh and yummy. Beer sampler was fun to try!	1
Their beers are really good, I just wish the food was that great too. I ordered the bacon chicken mac and cheese, which instantly got my mouth watering just thinking about it. I ate a little bit, but I didn't want to finish it. Way too much pepper or spices, and I could hardly taste the cheese. It would be better if they didn't label it as a mac and cheese, because it didn't taste like that at all to me. It came with a slice of french bread on the side, but it was plain. No butter on it or any on the side. Kinda weird.\n\nMy sister raved about her hazelnut crusted chicken, but I wasn't too impressed by that either. I ended up just drinking my dinner, which is just fine by me! :)	0
The food was rock bottom. \n\nIt was so disappointing that  me and two my friends could not finish our meals.	0
Great lunch!  Sat at the bar - busy spot - they have lots of take out orders.\nBartender do an ok job keeping up.\nSalad was delish!  A little too much arugula , so I removed some and it was better.\nWill look forward to coming back next visit to Charlotte	1
I had a fabulous time sitting at the bar on a busy Saturday. Meredith is an incredibly attentive bartender, regardless of her busy surroundings. Great beer. The food was pretty rockin'! Get the Mac and cheese!	1
first off, we walked in for a bigger table (6) and watched the manager, who didn't address us at ALL, make the host who had an injured arm put together 2 tables and rearrange the chairs without any help. The manager even made eye contact and still couldn't even say hello to us or the 2 people behind us waiting as well.  The server provided great service and the beer was good. The food was another story. The burgers were over done and the personal pizza was burnt on the bottom and missing cheese from a whole slice. I made pizzas in a deli for a few years and I must say I don't know how you can do that but there's a first time for everything. The house salad was 90 % white and 10 % green, weak! All in all the pizza got replaced and taken off the bill but was that enough to entice a return visit? Maybe for a beer.....	0
We went for lunch on Sunday Afternoon.  We sat there for ten minutes and nobody acknowledged us or came to our table.  A waitress passed our table two times and chose not to make eye contact with us.  Servers congregated at the hostess stand.  We walked out and still nobody noticed.  This used to be my favorite place uptown.  Really disappointed.	0
Bad service and mediocre food served cold.  If you have a large group and want to get together for lunch you would be better off bringing a bag lunch and meeting in a park. \n\n We made reservations but it took 30 minutes for our order to be taken and the food didn't show until an hour later at which point we all had to get back to work. And, the food was cold.\n\nThe kicker is that this  wasn't the first time this has happened.  A few weeks ago we all got exactly the same horrible level of service with cold mediocre food.\n\nIf I could give negative star rating I would.	0
My wife and I went here last weekend, it was really good.  We were just going to sit at the bar and have a drink but someone ordered pizza next to us and it looked awesome.  We ordered a pizza and new people sitting next to us started asking us about the pizza.  The food was good, the bar tenders were nice and the beer was good.  We will be back.	1
If I could design the perfect all-around restaurant, this would be it! Casual, but not too much. Wide range of food: from wings, to burgers, steaks, salads, fish tacos, and a ton more. New and clean inside, with an awesome bar area as well as private tables. I also love their outdoor seating, both the front and back sides. I've been coming here for almost ten years now, and still love it. The perfect neighborhood restaurant, whether you want a full steak dinner, or just wings and beer with friends.	1
I had the Tuscan Chicken Pasta. It was very well seasoned. My son-in-law had the Cajun Pasta, being from Louisiana it wasn't very spicy, but good nonetheless. Pleasant atmosphere, good service.	1
This place was great for atmosphere and large groups but the food actually sucked.  We ordered from the happy hour appetizer menu and our server was pretty slow and forgetful. She brought one of us crab dip that was cold (supposed to be served hot), then took forever to bring the drinks back. I asked if the southwest egg rolls were very spicy before I ordered, she said no and low and behold I get them and they are spicy.  The drink (margarita) was very strong and not sweet enough. Overall they get a D for food and an A for ambience and location.	0
The best steak I have had in my entire life. The spicy buttery sauce on top that steak OMG! I crave it daily, but my pockets can't afford it. Awesome atmosphere too.	1
Food is good, beer is amazing! Highly recommend stopping in if you're in the neighborhood.	1
I had my wedding here this past weekend.  It was awesome.  The staff - especially Nathan Hoffman - were amazing to work with.  The food was excellent, the setting was beautiful and things went according to plan.  I cannot say enough good things about Nathan.  He was great to work with and made the whole process so easy.  The City Club was the only venue we looked at that said they would do a tasting for us.  The food was excellent and the wine was outstanding.  \n\nThey even gave us a picnic basket of goodies when we left the venue - wine, cheese, cheesecake, crackers and more - some nice yummy midnight snacks!\n\nEveryone we worked with, dealt with and interacted with at every level was a pleasure to deal with.  Nathan really helped with the planning and the scheduling and made the entire process so much better for us.	1
This place Was horrible!!! The steak was over cooked and tough, the service was so slow that it took us 2 hours to get our food the wine was delivered after 40 minutes. Sure the view is cool but really?? Glad some one else paid or I would be MAD.	0
Came here for lunch with some colleagues.  \n\nAmazing place with so many cool rooms to check out.  Look to your left-there's a silent auction going on. Look to your right-two businessmen shaking hands. And look outside-breathtaking view of Charlotte from the 30th floor.\n\nService is solid. Very propers and stuff. Hyper-reactive to remove plates in front of you... so you can get bidness done.\n\nLunch buffet was so-so.  Cooking in quantity always loses that special touch.  Uneven cooking, undercooked, etc.  Probably better if you order off the menu.\n\nI think I might want to join. \n\ndmo out	1
This fast food place almost ALWAYS gets my order wrong. They charge me for things that they don't have. The lettuces on the garden salad is always weltered. Besides the staff being EXTREMELY unprofessional, the wait time is always long.	0
I had a great experience here. All the staff was friendly and Dr. Price was fantastic! When it came time to get new glasses and contacts, Jill was wonderful to work with, too! She helped me stay in budget and searched for every discount I could get with my insurance and current offers through manufacter rebates. I've been in Charlotte 14 years and this is the best place I've found for my eye care, and trust me, I've made the rounds!	1
I love Dr. W (his name is long and confusing to spell... let alone say) and this location (downtown in the BBandT building next to the Caribou- bonus!).  He is very patient and thorough and just a really nice guy.  His staff was super helpful in helping me pick out glasses and training me on how to put in and remove contacts (which was awful but not their fault).  They also filed everything with my insurance company, which is great.\n\nI also love that they call and email to remind of upcoming appointments.  I really appreciate this service.\n\nThey also have a location on Colony Rd., near the Lodge.\n\nI am a person who hates going to any type of doctor.  They really make this a nice experience.	1
I recently visited this eye doctor after moving to the area, and had a great experience. I saw Megan Price Osborne and she was super friendly and thorough. They offered convenient appointment hours for me to stop in over my lunch hour. I had to go back to work right after so I couldn't have my eyes dilated, they said to come back whenever I had time for it, so I did and it was fast and easy. The staff has been friendly and helped me fit my glasses on several occasions, even though I hadn't purchased them there. I would definitely recommend this place from my experiences so far.	1
I recently went for a general optometry appointment and found Dr. Price very nice and knowledgable. The staff there are very friendly and helpful as well!	1
Wonderful experience!! Staff was very nice, was flexible with scheduling, and explained exam during each step. I would definitely recommend visiting them to friends and family!	1
I got the fried rice with beef, and it was so-so.  I've had better.  The restaurant was decent andthe staff was friendly and fast.  But the food was just ok, and I have to admit that while I was eating it I was a little worried if I would get sick or not.  \nBut to be fair the other people I was eating with loved their food.  I heard the tempura vegetables were great.  Unfortunatley my experience was just mediocre. Thats the way it goes though, but  I will give them another shot , roll with the punches and try a different dish.  I'll keep you posted.	0
"one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \""asian\"""	1
Excellent food and good portions for the price.	1
Their food is made of magic.	1
"well well well (please push me in)\n\nI remember (as everyone else has stated) back in the day when this was the spot. \""Dot\"" (the owner) is/was a Church member of Community Outreach Christian Ministries and after \""chuch\"" we would make our way.. as soon as se would see me.. Heyyyyy baaaby!!\n\nyep.. please give me... BAKED CHICKEN (1/4), MAC & CHEESE, FRIED OKRA, DRESSING, and ARNOLD PARMER (TEA / LEMONAID). wth is this new thing called \""the oboma tea\"".... my god!!\n\n(my eyes are rolling in the back of my head as i type, singing...MEMORIESSSSSSSS, IN THE CORNER OF MY MINDDDDDDDDDDDDDD)\n\nfast foward to current state of \""Simmons\"". \nThis place being kinda a growing-up spot it saddens me to see it. Now it looks like it survied Katrina. \n\nFish - Not like it used to be.\nMac * Cheese - i agree w/ other reviews\nokra - you'll probably get about 12 pieces (15 if your nice)\nwhat happend to the plates, cups?? (as in real plates, spoons, forks etc) its all plastic and styrofoam.. signs the money is tigtening up.)\n\niF i return it will be just to speak and maybe pick up a drink (tea)."	0
The sanitation score for this place was 93.0.....I guess that was a red flag that I missed before I placed my order.\n\nI will start with the 'good'. The cashier was very polite, inviting, and helpful. Thank you.\nThe cornbread was 'decent'. Hooray that it wasnt the Jiffy brand.\n\nNow the 'bad' ( and I mean REALLY bad!)\nRemember that stuff we called 'mystery meat' in grade school? Well apparently it's still around except now they bury it under BBQ sauce and call it meatloaf at Simmons restaurant. Arrrggghhh! The baked chicken w/dressing was 'do-able', but you can get the Banquet frozen chicken entrees at your local grocery and do much better. \nThe food was horrendous! The broccoli casserole was watered down and over cooked....soggy. Seems like they used imitation cheese, because it certainly didnt melt. (I even nuked it 4 minutes on HIGH in the microwave.....nope, it didnt melt). The so-called brown gravy was tasteless and bland. \n\nDon't waste your time....	0
Borderline sanitation. Delicious food. Collards. Mac 'n cheese. Meatloaf. Obama tea.	1
Just had dinner at Presto earlier and I am STUFFED. For those of you hummus fans, you need to get this as an appetizer, it is excellent. Comes with warm pita slices for dipping, and a side of yogurt sauce as well. Delicious. \n\nThe atmosphere here was great, not a huge place but lots of room and they were accomodating two large parties at the time we were there. I ordered the flounder and shrimp francese, over creamy risotto with asparagus - PHE.NO.ME.NAL!!!!! This dish was so good I literally could not stop eating it, even when I abslutely could not fit anymore. I probably should have stopped, but couldn't. \n\nMy one reason for keeping this from being a 5 star restaurant was the heat - it was so warm in there, we literally could not wait to get out of there. And that doesn't say much considering it was just as hot outside. But it makes it difficult to fully enjoy a meal when you are breaking a sweat eating it. Maybe we went on a bad night. Either way, we are definitely going to go back here, it was excellent, even down to the ambiance and service.	1
I work downtown and we have ordered dinner when we have worked late!!! Their apps are great and large enough to have as a meal! Love their hummas just the right amount of lemon Olive oil and garlic! Yum! Another favorite is the Asian salad.	1
Ok.. Maybe I went here at the wrong time or something but I have to put in my two cents.  This is not a really cool hang out.  The bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly.  I went around 5pm on a Tuesday, but I don't think that was the problem.  The place just seemed small and shabby to me.  Im sorry to bash it because there are a lot of really good reviews here.  So just take my review with a grain of salt.  I will update my review when I give it a second chance and make it through my beer and order some food.  Sorry guys.. I would say make your way deeper into the city and try someplace else.  \n\nI gave it one star at first.. That was too harsh.. \n\n-Ian M.	0
My husband and I had the most awesome experience at Prestos our waiter Alex and Alaina were the best they suggested the shrimp & grits and the chicken martini and both were great! We will definently be back thanks for a great dining experience.	1
I came here for lunch during work.  The food was decent but 2 issues, 1 major one.  First - the water at this establishment is disgusting.  My friend got water with ice and it was awful and so I got water without ice and it was just as awful.  And I don't mean a slight aftertaste... it was very apparent to both of us that something was wrong with it.  It tasted like metal or plastic.  Which makes me worry that the water they use in cooking and other drinks like ice tea or lemonade is contaminated with something.  Second issue, not as huge, but we both ordered a sandwich, and the waitress didn't bother to ask what side we wanted - We didn't realize it came with a side until the food showed up with fries.	0
"We stopped in here for Dinner and it must have been an off night for them. I ordered a coke when it came it was very watered down. I commented to the waiter about the coke and his curt reply was \""I know, I get complaints about it all the time but nothing I can do about it.\"" I ordered a hamburger and when it came the bun was stale and the meat tasted freezer burned. While we were there the table next to us was complaining about the food also. Like I said maybe just an off night but we won't be back."	0
Eh.. \n\nI had the chicken alfredo; the noodles were hard, the sauce was thin.  Boyfriend had steak au poivre, which turned out to be brown gravy dumped over the steak. Interestingly, the steak was actually really good. and the gravy was good too but brown gravy over steak does not make it steak au poivre. \n\nNot their fault, but their credit card machines were down for like an hour... they did comp us drinks while we waited though. So, let's make that a 2.5 stars.	0
"OK, first they had lunch specials posted at we walked in which it did state it was lunch until server stated.  The server took the order quick but the entrees too a while, I had smothered chicken...yummy NOT, instead of pepper jack cheese they replaced it with American cheese white and yellow, not melted, my guest had BLT soup without the \""B\"" bacon, they replaced the bowl with bacon this time and added a stalk of greenry...hummmm.  The chef salad was a presto creation...a mound of meat and cheese that didn't look nice at all.  I was till trying to figure out why service took so long it was on a few, I see why the couple outside turned around when they looked in, I wish I had.  Also if you are using a groupon, etc.  they remove the tax and tip (18%)  from the total gift check which you pay them separate from the check and you cant order the three course meal which is $20 per person.  Visit at your own risk, next time I will only do the bar and apps, but the HOT TEA was good"	0
"Restaurant dot com you've let me down once again. I've got to ask myself why do I keep doing this. I guess the good restaurants don't have to use coupons. To be fair we ordered the three steak options on the menu, all a huge disappointment. First we must of got the \""sell by this date\"" steaks because its easy to tell what a previously frozen steak tastes like.   Second the New York strip was cut by the first day of culinary school student, coincidence Johnson & Wales is so close, hmm? No offense to Johnson and Wales but every school/university has drop outs. One side was about 3/4 inch, other side an inch, and was cooked to a shoe leather consistency. No excuse for an overcooked steak ever, and all ordered medium rare.\n\nAvoid this place even if free.\n\nOh yeah should of walk out when saw it was also a \""Hookah\"" lounge, seriously?"	0
Very poor service. Unremarkable at best.	0
I've been here quite a few times since i started working uptown. I usually get the sesame chicken and rice, which is just okay at best. However, today, I got the chicken and broccoli with rice and it was just bad. The chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy. It's too bad, they have a great location and everyone who works there is very nice, but the food is borderline awful. Today was definitely my last visit.	0
Seafood Noodle soup had slices of pork. The cilantro garnish wasn't even chopped.	0
The biscuits are to die for.  Seriously.  The bo berry biscuits are good if you want something sweet (and I mean sweet), but you can't beat just a plain, melt in your mouth biscuit.  \n\nService is good, too.  Can't remember a time when anyone's gotten my order wrong.  You can count on them to get it right.	1
I did some research, saw great reviews for this place and decided to try while on a trip. I love fried chicken, biscuts and potatoes so thought this was right up my alley.\n\nI went for breakfast.  The service was fast, but bottom line I wasnt impressed with the food. I got the fried chicken biscut with potatoes.  The fried chicken really didnt have any great flavor or juiciness to it. Yes the biscuts were good. The potatoes were like tater tots. Not what I expected for breakfast and nothing better than the average tater tot. No ketchup? I went back and asked for hot sauce which made it all tollerable. It wasnt horrible, it just wasnt great. \n\nIf you're looking for great fried chicken I wouldn't say this is the place.	0
I stayed here for 2 nights while in Charlotte for business.  It's a very nice hotel.  The front desk clerk was very personable, friendly and accomodating.  My room was really nice and spacious.  I had a view of the city which was nice but I didn't get to really enjoy since I was not in the room much.  The bed... Heavenly.  The Westin is known for their Heavenly beds and it definitely was.  High thread count sheets and fluffy pillows... the best night sleep I've ever had while on vacation.  I thought about working out at the nice gym but the bed... couldn't get out of it.  Room service was good, but expensive.  $12 for pastries and fruit?!  Well it is room service and when is that ever cheap?  Had a nice stay and will probably stay here again if I have to come back to visit.	1
We recently stayed a Saturday night and I thought that the place was not very well organized... Our room had plastic cups, wrapped in plastic, like at a motel... not glasses.  The dresser was dinged up and had a panel coming loose.  Ordering room service breakfast was an ordeal, and came with 3 eggs benedict, rather than 2.  \nThe gym was fantastic and huge, but the sauna did not work properly and never really got as hot as it should have.  \nThe bed was really nice, no doubt about it, I slept much later than I normally can in a hotel.  Before leaving the room, we called to have our car brought around....  the valet never got the message.  \nIt's a beautiful hotel, it's just that the details are off and things are a bit careless.  Maybe it's recession related.  Maybe they will have to be more on their game when the Ritz opens this fall.	0
I absolutely hate this place. Not for the amenities as they are undoubtedly the best in the business, but when you have a problem there is no one to help you. On my last stay I tried for several hours on an off trying to contact someone about the A/C in the room, or just for information about about some of the amenities. No answer. When I did get through to someone I was rudely told that only one person was answering the phones for the entire place. BTW, no one ever showed up to fix the air. \n\nI also have a problem with a place that wants to charge for internet access. Even the mom and pop hotels offer free in-room wifi or wired internet and with what this place charges it should be included. \n\nThe last thing, you get dinged for 18.00 just to park and if you aren't careful they'll double bill you for it if you've prepaid for the room. Parking should also be included in the price of the room and if you want one of those guys at the door to park your car, pay the 25 bucks.	0
It is amazing to me that they always seem to have a concierge on duty but they are very content to let us wait for 20 minutes to check-in or out.  I started staying here for business because I liked the design but i am constantly disappointed with the service.  It took me three tries and 10 minutes on hold to confirm my room for an additional night (all while I was running a meeting of 20 people).  The only group in that hotel that seems to have it together is the valet's.  If only it didn't take me as long to check out as to drive from the hotel to the airport.	0
First, let me say that I travel frequently both domestically and internationally and have stayed in a variety of hotels. This is the first time I feel compelled to write a bad review. The hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible.  Bathroom had hair on the floor and smudges still on the mirror. I left a New Tempur-Pedic pillow in the room and called the hotel to recover it. Each time I was transfered  to the security desk and they requested I call back later and see if housekeeping had turned the pillow in. After about 5 or 6 calls they did say they found the pillow and I had to give my credit card info to get it shipped to me.  It was not my pillow.  I called management and received a curt response that they would refund the shipping charges. (but they have still not done this 3 weeks later). I can only say that this hotel has zero commitment to customer service. I will never stay here again.	0
Beautiful lounge downstairs that doubles as a lobby/workspace and hotel bar. Great place to work, wait for someone, or hang out for a drink (my work team definitely had to do all three). \n\nThe rooms were extremely nice as well with amenities (fridge and iron, essential for a work hotel room). This location is completely walkable to the rest of the downtown area. They also sometimes have flavored ice water in the lobby which was a nice touch. \n\nMy only complaint was how overpriced breakfast was (the hotel bar was a bit overpriced, but not exceedingly so). $10 for an English muffin and a coffee? However, our server was very friendly and attentive -  and they also give you your coffee in a to go cup after you finish your sit down breakfast. Nothing like 3 cups of coffee and a spare before you get to a conference.	1
Exactly what you would expect from a Westin property. Nice decor, rooms are up to date, good location.\n\nThe lobby bar in a little unique with the waterfall thing.  I don't know how close the uptown restaurants are from a walking perspective but a nice place to stay and have a meeting.	1
"Like this Westin better than any I've stayed in. Lobby area is a large open space that gives me a travler-friendly feeling. Staff was over the top helpful and always friendly. Breakfast buffet was really nice each morning and bar area in the lobby was very modern and a nice place to relax. I found the rooms to a nice size, very clean and comfortable. This hotels proximity to the convention center was a tremendous plus. Only down side was the driveway and parking costs. Certainly goes on my lists of \""go to\"" hotels when in the area."	1
You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.\n\nWant a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  \n\nI will NEVER be back.	0
My recommendation? DO NOT STAY HERE if you have a choice. Depressing atmosphere and the staff is predominantly untrained and non-English-speaking. Room service extraordinarily expensive, e.g., $14 plus $6 delivery fee plus 21% mandatory gratuity for a bowl of oatmeal which would then cost about $24 without a glass of juice or even an egg! To add insult to injury, the only restaurant  in the hotel sucks. No ambiance and food is inferior and unhealthy. No concierge. If you need to take a cab to find a meal, the hotel bilks you on taxicabs. When doorman got  us a cab, it cost $7 plus a tip. For the same ride back to this awful hotel it was only $4 plus tip, without the hotel's ASS-istance!! The Hilton would probably have been better or perhaps ANY of the other hotels. Only reason I gave it two stars is because the gym and locker room were fine.	0
Don't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler. The Internet is awful and they don't support iPhone or iPad \n\nSo many better options around	0
"I was impressed with this place. Though busy for a wedding, they said they had open rooms on the top floor and were happy to move me \""for a better view.\"" Well done! I had a beautiful, large room on one of the top floors with a city view. Very clean, spacious, with a ridiculously comfortable bed and muscle-melting shower. Paying for internet did kind of suck. Parking garage was a bit confusing. But small details. I was passing through on a long drive and I was able to rest and relax quite nicely here. If I had the extra time, I would've stayed another day. The staff was always courteous. The following morning, one of the follow guests suffered a seizure on the hotel lobby and the matter was handled quite calmly and professionally by the staff. Kudos all around!"	1
I've been to better Sheratons and what hotel sends staff to knock on the door at 8:30pm telling me that I'm playing my banjo too loudly.  Never happened before and I'm in the thick of bluegrass country.	0
Hubby and I like to hang out in Charlotte on the weekends, and this is definately a great hotel. If you want to relax - it is suitable, but if you want to people watch and have a great drink - the lounge works too! \n\nThe rooms are always the same -  clean, cool and with a descent view of the Queen City! I have called ahead, and booked through the reservations line - and this is the only complaint I have. \n\nOne time I visited, they did not have my reservation on file. The front desk obviously does not share the information that the main booking line has. They had actually reserved a room in Columbia, SC in error - then charged us for not showing up !? \n\nEverything was resolved a week later so we got over it! \n\nAlso, if you stop in the bar on the way out, or just chill down there to enjoy the view -- you just might run into a celebrity. I refuse to name drop, but we have spotted a couple of celebrities there, and they are usually pretty friendly !	1
Beautiful view from the room and the BATHROOM !!!!\nStaff was very helpful, Rooms clean - Embers restaurant food good but limited menu. \nAll week the ice machine on floor 23 and 24 did not work. Called front desk but problem was never fixed - the whole week. Also they working on the pool deck area so we could not go out and relax on the deck on some of the most awesome sunny days.\n\nThe maids did and awesome job every day !	1
I love Starwood brand hotels.  This Westin is a very well run hotel.  I have stayed here several times for business. The service is excellent.  The rooms well done. The catering is outstanding.  The restaurants and bars are well done. The location is ok with a quick walk to the heart of Charlotte.  Stay here you won't be disappointed.	1
Great location especially if in town for a Panthers games. Clean rooms, comfy beds and nice staff. Late night lounge / bar scene is pretty good as well. Been here about 10 times and I'll come back again.	1
Great hotel. Bed was comfy, room clean and the bar relaxing. Kudos to Brian (front desk) and Jarrell at the bar - great staff! The view from our 25th floor was fantastic. Would definitely stay again!	1
I wanted to give it three stars because the lobby was so great, the bar and bar staff were awesome and the beds were comfortable enough. But for the rate that we paid the cleanliness of our hotel room was unacceptable. There was a massive stain in the middle of the floor and left over beverages from the last occupants, and a stain on the comforter. Big disappointment...try the Hilton.	0
In Charlotte for  conference.  Everyone has been incredibly nice, and helpful.  Good location. Walking distance to other hotels, shopping and dining.  Next door to Charleston Convention Center.	1
Okay, from a distance this looks like a nice hotel. But Its definitely not worth the money. The pool is made from the same material as a shower in a mobile home. Its long(ish) and not wide, with its deepest point at 4 ft. The other half of the pool is 3 feet, so you can't swim laps unless you want to hit the bottom. The fitness center lacks a fan, so working out gets too hot. The room itself has a nice view but seriously all it is is a bed and a shower. There's nothing all that nice about this $300/night room. There is nothing included: no breakfast, no drinks, a water bottle in the room costs $4, internet for ONE device is $12/day. With that price, Id expect much much more. I feel like I should only be spending maybe $100. The only reason why they get away with this price is because its conveniently located next to the convention center. Otherwise, I will never stay at this place. They nickel and dime you everywhere you turn!	0
My husband and I were here for a wedding and it happened to be the same weekend as the Coke a Cola 600. So, there were a ton of people and we were always greeted with a smile and even given an early checkin and late check out. Our room had an amazing view of downtown, but I did notice that the comforter was not clean. I'm hoping it was a coffee stain. Minus that everything was up to par and would live to stay here again.	1
I am only giving them a 5 because of the service I received.  I have stayed here before and the rooms are always great and this time I unfortunately got a room that must have had a party in it.  Stains on the carpet and the walls were damaged and marked up.	1
So I've stayed at this hotel several times now.  I really enjoy the convenient location to the light rail.  There are several good local spots to eat at just off the light rail's route.  The breakfast Buffett in the lobby is expensive, but pretty good.  I've had drinks at the bar down stairs, and let me tell you that you'll be paying full price for under poured cocktails.  I've never had an issue with the staff.  They've always been helpful and friendly.  They have a car service available out front, so you can roll in style, for a price.  If you have the extra cash, not a bad spot to stay.	1
We always stay here when in Charlotte. \nI've always had a clean king room and friendly, efficient service. Full service Starbucks coffee downstairs in the lobby. The room has free Starbucks medium roast coffee, with coffee maker in your room. \nA mini fridge and safe are built into the dresser the TV sits on.\nThere's a make-up mirror, hair dryer, iron and ironing board in the room too. \nThey have a good breakfast buffet in Embers. It's a bit pricy though. \nHaving the affordable light rail (it's NOT FREE) right behind the hotel is VERY Convenient too. You won't have to take a taxi to get to the Time Warner cable arena. But if you need a ride they offer towncar service out of the hotel for a decent rate. \nThere's convention space in the hotel and the Charlotte convention center is right next door. \nBe sure to sign up for the SPG rewards so you can earn a free night at an SPG property.	1
Great Stay During Business Travel in Sept 2013\n\nClean, modern, comfortable bed, good gym, indoor pool, two bars, a Starbucks in the lobby, and great downtown location.\n\nSide Note, the architect of this building is very cool.	1
I am writing this after my horrible Omni experience because now I appreciate my experience here even more. The staff are great and I had a very wonderful experience. I didn't get that intrusive uncomfortable feeling like I did at the Omni. The room was very modern and their electronics were up to date including the ipod deck and the mini bar. The room was CLEAN and large just like the bathroom. And the view from the large windows was beautiful.	1
An architectural site, this is one of the better Westin's.\n\nPros:\nGreat restaurant, food is creative and tasty\nLocation in the middle of downtown Charlotte\nGreat for the price\n\nCons:\nRooms a little bit on the smaller side\n\nOverall, a great stay	1
Great place. Accommodating and the staff was awesome\nI had an incident yesterday. They had some sort of rapper or hip hop artist staying in the room next to mine. They were being loud, a lot of cursing and shouting, many doors brig slammed. And this occurred in the room (which was next to mine) and in the hallway. It went on until late at night (4 am)\nI felt unsafe and not comfortable calling security. I should. Retaliation was my main concern. I expressed my discontent this morning and manager gave me the possibility if late check out, which was nice considering my flight is schedule to depart at 6 pm. All and all it was good, however I would recommend to ANY hotel that have guests that are prone to kiss behave and not obey the rules to either NOT have anyone stay in t contiguous room (or on the floor at all) or to warn them prior to checking them in.	1
I love this hotel.  Love love love.  I stayed years ago for business and was impressed and recently stayed for a wedding weekend and was not let down.  The staff was super nice, the car service was prompt, our room was nice and the location is great.  My only complaint was the A/C in our room was acting really wacky and not coming on and the drinks at the bar (which the patio is a great area outside to relax) were kinda pricey.	1
"One word \""heavenly\"" beds. Need I say more. I'm a fan of Westin everywhere I travel. The beds alone make it a good stay. This location is ideal, right in the city center. Walking distance from EpiCenter and far enough away from the noise.\n\nThis Westin was as expected. The staff were friendly, but as another yelper stated. They didn't go out of there way. Being a SPG gold member, we were put in a superior king room. The view of the city was amazing from the room."	1
Need a place in Charlotte to get black out drunk without fear of waking up missing vital organs? Than the Westin Charlotte is the place for you. Was witness to an amateur drunk who passed out. Rather than doing the typical bounce and toss the staff gave genuine care and concern to the help him through the this moment of self reflection. One employee went so far as to ice his neck in hope to help him sober up, if nothing else at least remeber his name. Even when the EMTs arrived and drunk punches were thrown the staff stood stoically ready to show their support for their customer. So, it became a dinner and a show. Five stars.  NERD RAGE!	1
A beautiful hotel with accommodating staff and good amenities. The catering is splendid. The food is fresh and REALLY good! I don't need to say anymore than what has been said about the beds. Just the best there is. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Charlotte's beauty can be seen out my window. Stay here!	1
I can only speak from the experience of staying here for a recent convention. Several conferees and I had issues with the staff during the event over displays and services. Due to the nature of the event (romance novelists and readers) I got the impression they hovered close in case we decided to cause trouble. I did not find the venue pleasant.\n\nWhile my room was clean, I think the bed aggravated my back pain. I also understand a number of conferees who drank the water experienced discomfort and sore throats.	0
Great location for someone new to the city. Your right in the middle of it all! Within walking distance of Charlotte's great bars & restaurants. The staff was very accommodating.	1
Recently stayed at this Holiday Inn location for a business trip and was pretty happy with it.  The location is great and the room was pretty comfortable.  Free Wi-Fi is very nice since so many hotels now charge you a fee.  It was walking distance to many restaurants and pretty much in the middle of everything.  If I were to come for a personal trip, I would probably still stay here if the price is reasonable.	1
I stay in 3 to 4 hotel rooms a week so I am not too picky when it comes to beds but these were terrible. If I'm going to pay $160/night I at least want a decent bed. And this may sound weird but the toilet seats were too small (and I'm a small guy). The rooms were clean but I would not stay here again.	0
We had a great experience here:  helpful staff, clean room, comfy bed, free WIFI, and plenty of security.  My only complaint was that silly basin sink located at the entrance to the room.\n\nThis hotel is marvelously situated within walking distance to some of the best entertainment and dining in town.	1
AWFUL!! i booked a hotel room here for New Years Eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room! 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before I was staying there my credit card was charged for the room!  I was treated like an idiot by Carmen who answered the phone.  She kept saying that I should have known but I would not have been so upset if I had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted!!  Make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room!!  Would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way I have been treated!!!	0
"We had a series of misfortunate events take place from the moment we arrived, all the way through to the time we left.  It's actually quite sad because I'd like to share the information, but I'd rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place.  It's awful and we won't be going back.  The worst of our experience?  Let's just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room, while we were in it, with the privacy sign on, pretty much sealed the deal here.  If anyone's had theft problems, this may be why.  Hotel staff was quick to throw out \""sorry\"" for each thing that went wrong, but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said. (I didn't want to give this place any stars, but one star is needed to submit this review...)"	0
Steer clear of this hotel.  Mediocre rooms but very unpleasant service - they do not honor reservation requests and have nothing but excuses. Bar is way overpriced.  There are MANY choices in Charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one.	0
Beware of this hotel...  Under renovations until December 30, 2014.  New RF ID keys and I have had to get a new key 3 days in a row!  \n\nThe middle elevator has been known to get stuck or doors not even opening....  Things to just be aware of!	0
Went here yesterday to experience what it's like in an indoor waterpark. Overall it was nice except everyone had to exit the water not once but TWICE. Let's just say not everyone swimming doesn't have bladder control. Anyways, food/snacks are surprisingly cheap with a decent menu. Can't imagine what it's like in the summer. Admission is cheap to (especially if you're a county resident).	1
We went on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We all had a wonderful time until the end. We were in the womens locker room and even though they had a family locker room there were little boys there about 6-7 years old changing in the room too and one walking around with no clothes on. I had my little sister and did not appreciate it at all. When I talked to staff all they asked me was if they had autism? It doesnt chnge anything.Come on there was a family bathroom right there. And they didn't seem too concerned about my complaint. And the bathrooms were nasty. But if you don't use the locker rooms or bathrooms it is good.	0
"Visiting out if state. Needed something to do on short notice due to bad weather. My daughter (6) had much fun. Not tall enough for the big slide (48\""), but she was not fazed.\n\nThe accommodations in the shower/bathroom left something to be desired, e.g. hooks in the shower stalls, perhaps locks to rent for the lockers? but it was nice. \n\nNice staff, bathrooms were nice (until a jerk put swim diapers in the centrifuge for drying bathing suits), and the pool was clean (and heated). Cheap admission and snacks. We would go again if we were in town and needed something to do if the weather were to be uncooperative.\n\nGreat to see a community center like that and tax dollars put to great use. I'm envious; I wish we had something like that."	1
"As others have mentioned, it does seem a bit creepy deepy to a) review a cemetery and b) also see the categories for this location as \""Funeral Services & Cemeteries\"" AND \""Active Life.\"" However, that's a perfect description of Elmwood Cemetery. It is a stunning space of lush green grass, ancient trees and flowering bushes and home to some of the oldest resting places in Charlotte. \n\nDuring the daylight hours, this space is a breeding ground for dog walkers, joggers and pensive, respectful photographers. The winding roads are great for anyone who needs a bit of exercise and many of the gravestones are quite beautiful and interesting. Many of the folks buried here were from the same well-established (old money) families who still reside in Charlotte today. \n\nWhile it may seem odd to schedule a run in a cemetery, I promise that you won't regret it at Elmwood Cemetery. It's picturesque, interesting and, of course, quite quiet!"	1
Great place for a bike ride. Super close to uptown. Could definitely bring a bottle of wine and make it a picnic with the use of a little discretion.	1
This is a nice place with ample amount of space to study, read, or just play around on the internet.  The establishment is full of great books, probably the biggest selection that I have seen since being a student at Appalachian State University.  If there is a line for the computers they only give you an hour to be online, but this is usually not a problem.  Everyone keeps pretty quiet and I would recommend it for studying or an afternoon read.	1
Full o' bums....er...the less fortunate...who camp out inside to either sleep or use the restrooms to bathe in. Plenty of other sketchy people who don't look like they're there to read. If perverts had a chip implanted in them, the device used to find them might target this location as Ground Zero from what I've heard horror-story wise from others.\n\nToo many floors for a library but a decent selection.  I only care for this one since it's so close by my work. I do all of my lending online and have my book ready and waiting for me when it's available near the front counter so I don't have to venture too far inside.\n\nFor others, you would have to contend with finding parking or riding public transportation. \n\nNot really worth it.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter	0
This is my first time visiting Charlotte. ( A three-month stay) I was very surprised that 51 books I may read are in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Library system. True enough, someone from Los Angeles (like myself), New York or Boston would not be completely delighted with the range of subject matter, you can find something. Upon entry and departure, I enjoyed reading the quotes on the pillars. Happy hunting!\n\np.s. A word of caution, bring a sturdy bag from home to carry your books. The library hasn't designed their own bags and give those flimsy ones from the grocery store.\n\nThis location is closed Sundays and Mondays during the summer.	1
I use the MAC for lap swims.  They have 6, 7 & 13 foot lanes.  There are plenty of lanes and over a month of going there I haven't had to share a lane once but even if one did have to share, they are generous lanes with good marking on the flooring.  The water is cool; perfect for a workout but if one wanted there is a smaller warm pool as well. \n\nThe great thing is that you can pay $5 as a county resident for single visits.  It's only a few dollars more for non-residents so if you are visiting from out of town and want to keep your training going, stay at the Hampton or the Hilton for easy access to the MAC.\n\nI have to admit that the facility is old.  The locker rooms are grimy and dirty with old fixtures but there are plenty of lockers, showers, stalls and spacious to change out.  The number and size of lanes makes up for the small amount of time you spend in the locker room and outside of the pool.	1
"I like to think of myself as an appreciater of art.  I've loved the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Art Institute of Chicago, The National Gallery in London, and, of course, the Smithsonian in DC.  Upon moving to Charlotte, we decided to visit the Museum of Crap + Design (er, Craft + Design) one afternoon (it's free between certain hours on Tuesdays) to check it out.   We quickly breezed our way through it, as what we saw were mostly sticks and twigs stuck into things.  It was not impressive by any means and not \""art\"" in my book.  I'll stick to Charlotte's Mint Museum of Art if I want to see something artsy."	0
"I'm a big fan of the Mint Museum of Craft + Design. Their exhibits always feature beautiful works. I really liked \""Possibilities: Rising Stars of Contemporary Craft in North Carolina\"" in the summer. Like Mindy W., I particularly liked the work of Anne Lemanski. Her art involves three-D constructions of animals using politically charged images. Right now, there is also an avant-garde jewelry exhibition at the museum.\n\nIf you're new in town, appreciate art and are looking to meet people, I'd recommend checking out the Young Affiliates of the Mint. It's a social group for young Mint supporters. They have fun parties and monthly happy hours on the roof of the Mint. It's a great venue because you're in the middle of Uptown's skylines and have a really unique view of the city."	1
"My daughter will be leaving Queens after this spring.  I feel like we were duped.  \n\nThe school is a publicity machine with nothing behind it.  The students have no sense of community, and the neighbors hate them.  My daughter has had terrible things said and shouted at her by the supposedly \""charming\"" upscale people with their \""beautiful\"" homes.  The neighbors hate the school and take it out on students.\n\nThe school does not care about students once they have enrolled.  They nickel and dime them for every little thing.  There is no social life on the campus or near the campus.  \n\nMy daughter says that the morale of the teachers is awful.   Two have talked about what they make and how it is insufficient.\n\nMy daughter has older friends who did well on their SATs and had good grades and cant get into graduate school.  There is no network to help with jobs, except maybe nursing.\n\nDont send your child to Queens."	0
THE BEST place to get coffee in Charlotte!  Clay, Phoebe and the rest of the staff will do their best to make you welcome!	1
Facility OK.  Shipping is horrible.  Bring on the Brown.  While the place is OK for copies and such,  Fedex shipping is worse than the post office.  Slow and often laden with problems.  UPS from now own	0
Time Warner over AT&T any day of the year...	1
All I can say is that A) I had no other option then to go with Time Warner Cable for my internet service \n\nand B....\n\nIf you don't have a local number it will be an absolute NIGHTMARE to pay your bill! You can go through the ring of automated messages only to get to a live person (after 10-15 min) then be told they will charge you so you must go through the automated service ....(repeat ). I cringe when it comes time to pay my bill each month.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to avoid using them -I suggest you do so !	0
I was a customer for approx 16 yrs.  Only because they were my only option.  Came home one day to find out they had cut off my service because I had a balance of $28.00.  It was gonna be $150 and 2 wks before I could get it turned back on.  Needless, to say I told them to bite me and welcomed DirecTV which I love. !!!	0
So I haven't had TWC in 3.5 years and have heard nothing from them (I live in area of SC that they don't service).  Today I get a collection notice from them for $48.  Stop spending money to name every arena in the nation and hire some people who know what they're doing.	0
Well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try.  Well, I ended up telling them I never wanted to hear even their name again.  4wks later and I still had nothing hooked up and they cut the main cable line to my condo property and at&t's line when trying to bury some new lines for me.  They have no idea what they are doing and you get a different story each time you call them.  They better never even step foot near my door again.  Horrible !!!!	0
UGH!  Worst service ever!!!  We kept having issues with our wireless where it would go out sporatically so we called up TW and they sent out a service person to take a look.  First of all, they charge for the service visit because they outsource their maintenance.  Second of all, after FIVE visits (most of which were extremely late and tracked dirt into our apartment) the problem was still not rectified.  They tried to charge us for a new modem because they said that would fix the problem, and when it didn't, it took forever for them to pay me back for the modem we weren't using.\n\nJust switched to ATT U-Verse and it's cheaper, better, and they don't call every month to see if I want to add services.	0
"In my area, I have my choice of Time Warner, Windstream & DirectTV. I went with Time Warner many years ago because of the fabulous bundle pricing (basic cable DVR & high speed internet, only). Unfortunately, like almost everything else, they reward you so well as a new customer, but do not offer anything for loyalty.\n\nI've been with them almost 6 years & the first few years were fine.  I was happy with a below $100 bill every month & never had any outages.  Fast forward to the past couple of years & I've had outages out of the blue, significant rate increases, locked into two different year contracts, only to have my bill stand at a whopping $141 every month.  When calling to report outages / issues, I get the run around & a \""few days out\"" scheduled appointment.  As far as trying to get a better deal on my service...I'm always told, \""there aren't any promotions available to you right now\"".\n\nBuyer's remorse? You bet."	0
This is for Time Warner Cable as a whole:\nFOR SHAME!\n\nThe house next door is a rental. Everytime somebody moves out and has their cable disconnected, our's is disconnected too. I have to call and have it reconnected. They always want somebody to be at the home when a technician comes and I have to argue with the service rep that there is no reason for me to be at home and to do the connection at the street. Still they argue that someone has to be there. I refuse and tell them either send somebody out there or DirectTV is looking pretty promising. Boom! Done. Somebody finally comes out there when I'm not home. This last time the technician actually came back out to ask me about what's going on and he went back up the pole and labled our cables seperately to hopefully avoid an outage when somebody moves out again. I wish I got his name to give him some kudos. \n\nAlways ask for a credit for a day or two's worth whenever you have an outage.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter	0
"TWC IS THE WORST!\n\nUnfortunately, TWC has basically monopolized the Charlotte area.  I am very jealous of all the people who have AT&T Uverse available to them.  I have contemplated DirectTV because TWC is so awful.  Every few months the \""promotion\"" on my plan runs out and when I call they say they are giving me the best possible promotion that they usually don't give to any other customer by taking $5 off...how generous.  They really don't care if their customers are unhappy because they know they have no other choice for digital TV.  If you have other options, USE THEM!"	0
Some of the worst service ever.  I called to cancel service and was transferred to retension.  After 53 minutes on the phone and trying to cancel service, I somehow agreed to keep the service for 6 months at a significantly reduced rate.  I then recieved  the bill the next month and the price had no change.  I called and they wrote in there notes some  othert agreement.  I asked to speak to manager and they denied me.  I told them I want my service canceled now and that I was not going to pay the bill.  They said no.  I asked for the manager he said no.  He then said if I ask for manager he will need to hang up.  He hung up.  His name is Jesus and will not give any other identification to me.  He is in the retention department.  If you are the manager of this employee, please review his work.	0
I was offered internet sufficient to stream video for $29.99, and then when called to set up appointment to install service I asked what I would be charged and was told $34.95. I then called customer service to discuss what I would be paying and was told the $34.95. I explained that I had been quoted less, and the agent told me he could not do anything to help me. I think service providers should honor their word. I will use a carrier that is truthful and honest.	0
Terrible customer service.  I wanted to change my services, after an hour and a half on the phone, the change I wanted was not done and I was disconnected.  Called back and was told wait time would be 30 minutes.  I gave up.  If I could cancel service on line, I would, but that is not an option.  The only way to cancel is to call their number wait forever and pray you dont get cut off.  If you are looking to subscribe look at other alternatives first.  I read somewhere that Charlotte has the highest Time Warner rates in the country.  Avoid this company if you can.  Once they have you they make it hard to escape.	0
Wish I could give TWC zero stars. They have billed me wrong consistently for 4 months straight, then hit me with fees that don't make any sense. When I call to discuss, I am on hold for an average of 40 minutes. When I finally get someone on the phone, they are rarely helpful. One woman told me her manager would call me back and he never did. \n\nThe worst part is, I'm an accountant and even I can't figure out their billing system. It should be illegal the way they bill people. It doesn't help that they have a monopoly on almost all downtown apartments in the Charlotte area. I have bugged AT&T U-verse about offering in my area, so hopefully I will be able to switch soon. If you are considering moving into an apartment building that only offers TWC, I urge you to reconsider! Possible the most frustrating company I have ever interacted with.	0
I dislike TWC.  I searched online for drop-off locations and found several; however, none of the phone numbers are in service.  I decided to drive to one of the locations only to find it doesn't exist.  I am so frustrated with trying to return this box.  If you live in the Charlotte NC area, where can I drop this darn box off to?	0
TWC is the worst cable company I've ever dealt with. Each time I've called for Tech Support I was on hold for at least an hour. Their only response is to unplug the box.  I'm on my 2nd DVR box in 2 months & channels go out randomly.  If you can get cable somewhere else do it!	0
I have tried repeatedly to get this company to refund an incorrect amount charged to my mother who died.  There is no email and I have spent hours on the phone.  USE any other service if you can.	0
I do not like this company! For years I have been forced to work with them for Internet and cable and have been consistently dissatisfied with the customer service. Inconsistent billing, poor customer service, and lies sum up this service. Can't wait for more service providers.	0
"My wife and I have always liked the cable repair personnel but the customer service has always been the biggest joke- wrong departments , dropped calls, crazy appointment problems. I'm a small businessman who has sadly come to the conclusion that large corporations that dominate a market have no incentives to provide good service,customer communication, and reasonable prices. Time Warner Cable has done a horrible job of operating in this area although I fear that   the competitors are any better. A tollfree guy told me about \""claiming\"" to have an appointment I scheduled and wanted to know who I wanted to talk to- I said whoever can help me fix my problem- he then asked what department that was and in the transfer the line went dead. Its a sorry corporation that doesn't care about customer dissatisfaction, and wasted time spent by the consumer."	0
TWC has turned me off again! How can u deprive your paying customers of SHOWTIME???? I have to ask myself...if no more Dexter, Ray Donovan, Homeland, and Shameless, what is the point of having cable? Seriously folks. They are getting out of hand and this takes the cake. I pay i have say and i say screw them! If everyone cancelled maybe they would rethink their decision. I have nothing else to watch	0
I vote Time Warner Cable the worst company of all times. I spent 30 minutes on hold tonight trying to find out why my bill has gone from 29.99 to 55.00 per month and I can not see any change in the quality of service. Their website will only allow me to increase my cost but offers no suggestions as to how I might save money. I guess no one has ever told their management that it is cheaper to keep a customer than to try and get them back. Don't get me wrong there are other bad and good companies. I love American Express they are the best company in America. Uverse is the second worst company in America in my humble opinion. Tmobile is 3rd worst company and Direct TV is the 4th worst. After that I would say Sprint is the 5th worst. By the way I have Dish for my TV and have been pleased for the most part with their service.  If you have other ideas please add.	0
"TW raised my internet rates twice in 18 months and called it \""a discount\"", WTF.  \n\nWhen it runs it's super fast (33m) but the connection is erratic. Customer service is typical for telecoms and the installation was sloppy. \n\nThe only reason I have to give them two stars is because I was stuck for years with Comcast and that was MUCH worse."	0
After Time Warner Cable raised my internet rates again with no improved service, I switched to EarthLink. While earthlink gave me the introductory rate, TWC who services the account, was unable or unwilling to honor it. I think I have spoken by now to 21 representatives, spend a good 5 hours on the phone, lost Internet three times because TWC turned it off; and still got overcharged by $40. They say they have it fixed now. I am not holding my breath here.	0
I wish there were zero stars. I had TWC for several years and they were always a pain. Internet service was shoddy, they throttle speed,  they bully you into cable subscriptions to keep themselves relevant, and they just gave us a $125 unreturned equipment fee for equipment that I did in fact return. They have odd hours,  and if you move you have to physically bring the box to their office. And guess what?  No after hours drop box,  so your only option is to take time out of your work day. AT&T is much better. Avoid TWC like the plague. They'll never stop nickel and diming you.	0
The drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous. It's as tedious as waiting at the DMV. I don't understand why Time Warner can't pick up the box, since it's required for someone to come to the house to install it. \n\nOr at least have a drop-off box! Or here's another idea- hire more than one employee in a waiting room of 50 people.\n\nStep it up Time Warner!!!	0
Prepare for a LONG wait, poor customer service and God forbid you have to use the restroom while you wait 30+ minutes! Unfortunately there is nothing good I can say about TW Cable. Besides the extremely poor customer service when visiting their office, the equipment they offer is outdated, to reach someone in customer service via a phone call, you are definitely going to be dealing with a mess.\n\nThe best DVR they can offer customers is a model that can only record 2 shows at a time compared to other companies that now have models that can record up to 5 shows at a time. The only reason I am with them is because they are the only provider for my home at the moment and satellite is not an option.	0
If you want crappy customer service, avoidance at all costs to FIX a problem that has been questioned for months (we have service cut outs on a daily basis-fyi we're gamers in this household we need good internet that doesn't cut out every day), and high prices...\nThen choose TWC.\n\nTWC reps do NOT READ your reports (we had a report drawn up so we could go to a senior tech). The girl who answered after we waited for 10+ minutes on hold wanted to go over the WHOLE issue with us again when it was already written out in the report had she bothered to read it.\n\nIf you want better internet, go elsewhere but let me know because I'll come with you!!\nStep it UP!!	0
BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRETTY MUCH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE \nI am so tired overpaying and dealing with this company. From messed up bills, service outages to customer service people who just do not care (yes, even hand up). \nReady to cancel right after the World Cup!	0
I love how they just sent me a letter to inform me about their price increase while saying I am still enjoying their special promotion.....I have been a customer for the past 7 years, not by choice, since dish and directv are so unreliable during storm season. Their dvr is old and slow compare to its counterparts. Internet connection is unstable. Safe to say, I will be looking at AT&T and Google fiber really soon.	0
The worst place on earth. Lines are ridiculous no matter what time you arrive, customer service is deplorable and there are never enough parking spaces. This place rivals the dmv and social security office, Time Warner is a monopoly in Charlotte so it doesn't have to worry with how it treats it's customers. We normally don't have cable, but we're adding it back for football season. I am spending my day off waiting in this absurd line for a cable box so that my husband can watch the Panthers. If only we could get ESPN on our Apple TV... I can't wait until we can just stream everything	0
"What a joke of a company. Absolutely horrible customer service and it infuriates me that I pay these rates for a product/service that continues to experience \""outages\"" and I cant even  watch the channels I want  to.  \n\nAn absolute horrible company and it upsets me every month that I pay them for \""service\"" because there is not another cable provider in my area."	0
How can TWC even have 1.5 stars? I find it very frustrating that with over thirty people waiting, they have two (and sometimes only one) employee helping customers. There are spaces for five employees.\n\nOf course, that would require some interest on the part of TWC in providing any level of customer service. After having their service for nearly two decades, all I can say is that I feel they treat their customers solely as a source of revenue. We aren't customers to be earned. We aren't customers to keep happy. We are people for whom they provide below minimum service and in exchange we are given the privilege of paying them too much money.\n\nLike others, when Charlotte gets Google Fiber, I will leave TWC and never look back.	0
"Hahaha....I don't even know what type of review to write. Let me start off by saying I've had TW for about 4 months and cancelled my services TODAY! (And it felt awesome) I now have AT&T U-verse :) I almost never write reviews but today I will. \n\nCustomer Service: sucks! I waited and waited and waited and waited....before I actually was able to talk to someone who could assist me with ONE of my problems.\n\nBills: I recieved a $400+ bill before (and I only have one tv in my small studio apartment) needless to say my soul left my body for 10 seconds when I saw the bill...\nI'm a struggling law student, you best believe I called up customer service and \""acted a damn fool.\"" After praying to God for cussing the representatives and having my bill reduced all was well....and then....\n\nCrisis number 2 happened. Two months later I recieved another high bill of $300 plus dollars...I had enough....\n\nNeedless to say I am currently packing up TW equipment and ready to drop it off tomorrow...."	0
I recently had lunch with a colleague at Ratcliffe on the Green. It a business lunch and I usually don't note things like the building and decor, but in this case it was unavoidable. The decor and service were impeccable. The service had that nice balance of friendliness and professionalism. They were always available and addressed out needs, but I never saw them hovering about. My colleague is a regular there, so we were greeted warmly and our greeter (who happened to also be an active local judge???) shared with us some stories from his recent trip to Paris. My meal started with a cream of tomato soup, that was much thicker than I had anticipated, but still very tasty. Lunch was a Carolina Crab Cake Salad which was fabulous. Nice view of downtown Charlotte outside our window table from which we were able to watch a rain storm pass, thankfully, before heading back to work.	1
...and they're closed.  Couldn't have happened to a more deserving group of people.  Found out the chef that told me he was the owner was NOT the owner.  Found out he left less than a month after this incident.  The restaurant closed less than four months after that.  Good riddance!	0
Mediocre overpriced threading. Maybe I'm spoiled by my shabby little nails/threading place in New York, but Modern-Phillips Place charged me $70+ for what would be $30-40 in NY (compare business rents). \nSodi threaded my face in no particular order so I ended up with strays. It scared me to death the way she hopped between my sideburns and my brows--you can lose half a brow that way. \nNo consultation on the shaping. MEDIOCRE brow shaping with rows of sticking out hairs along the curve. She did that way too rapidly with tweezers (so I guess she can't really do the fine work of threading a brow). The edge of a properly shaped brow should be perfectly sharp but also natural as if it grew that way. Holes should appear to be filled in magically. My brows also now sit a bit unevenly on my face. She wears a magnifier and this may give her a peephole view that is inadequate to perceive the overall shape, but it should have allowed her to create a totally smooth edge and NO STRAYS.\nNo pre-sanitation or post-care of the skin.\nA mark where she caught my skin in her thread.\nPlus, cold rude staff.	0
$51 Pedicure should have been way better than it was. If you're short, you'll have to be uncomfortable because the seat doesn't adjust. Skip it and try somewhere else for a spa pedicure.	0
I never have time to make appts in advance and because if that I never seem to be able to see the same stylist twice. At most salons this would worry me but I've never gotten a bad hair cut at modern! I live in NYC and I try to make it back to Charlotte as often as possible to get my hair done here!	1
I had Modern Salon and Spa Uptown do my wedding party's hair.  Our hair and make up turned out ok but we felt that we were way over charged.  I had one bridesmaids who was in the chair less than 20 minutes and recieved a curled pony tail.  She was charged $85.00.  Nobody at the salon could understand why we were upset.   \n\nI would not reccomend having your wedding party go to Modern...	0
I attended the 2013 AAHPERD National Convention.  A very good venue, with a food court.  I liked it a lot.	1
The Convention Center needs better souvenir store/vendor. Everything looked old and used. Not a lot of souvenirs to pick. Poor souvenir  store. Need major improvement.	0
We just had fifty high school students interview here and it was a great location.  Kind of a ghost town because it's so large, but the space was really nice.  Our event coordinator was a bit worried because there were several different people involved (e.g., space, food, parking, etc.) but everything went smoothly and we'll likely host the interviews there again.  In the past we were at the Westin but this place was half the price!  \n\nThe wifi was definitely spotty but it was free so that was a plus.  They had several places to grab some food like Einstein bagels and Bojangles.  We had their catering and it was fantastic.  Has anyone ever said that about convention center catering?  There were a variety of salads, sandwiches, acorn & carrot soup, key lime pie and chocolate mousse.  \n\nOverall, we had a really positive experience and we'll be back!	1
The nicest Residence Inn I have stayed in thus far. Very Impressive.	1
We had a nice stay here. Staff was very friendly and the room was nice and quiet with a good view of the city. I would say it was a good value.	1
Stayed here while in Charlotte for my conference and it was very nice, one thing I love about staying at Residence Inn's is the nightly reception with wine, beer and snacks. \nThe breakfast buffet was fresh every morning and fully stocked. The room was very big and the two TVs were great. \n\nWhat else can one ask for in a stay. About a 8 min walk to the convention center.	1
Good location. Terrible front desk staff & way over priced. The front desk staff was not interested in helping me checkin. She kept answering the phone even though others were there. We had an issue as when I booked via my phone it didn't say there was a $75 fee for a pet. We left. Made a one night stay $325. Ummm you are a Marriott not the Ritz	0
"[SHOCKED!]  No one has written a review about B&N in the Arboretum??!!??\n\nI guess that does illustrate the shift in bookstores will the online market like Amazon....  I do like the steps that B&N are taking to try to adjust to the times.  Example 1:  The Nook E-Reader is pretty cool and shows that it will give the Kindle a run for it's money.  Still there is no e-replacement of a physical book in ones hand and the smell of pages as you thumb through.\n\nThis B&N is large, very large.  There is a coffee shop located in the center of it and tons of seats and couches around the store for nestling in for a good read.  I always feel guilty doing that and not buying anything, but to each his/her own.\n\nThat being said, the pricing in the store is habitually higher than prices you can fine online.   Even books in their \""bargain\"" section seem a little high as well.\n\nI'll stick to using the store to browse and for gift ideas for the time being."	1
I just went through training this past week for a new job that I start on Monday. The company gave us uniforms that this woman altered and had ready on Saturday. (3/9/13) She worked on 2 of my friends' shirts & pants and three pairs of my pants. Our company paid for all of the alterations. I thought that was great service!	1
This review is for alterations only. Based on other reviews here, it seems they are good at dry cleaning, so I'm suggesting they just stick to that. I had a handful of garments altered here and they all turned out poorly.\n\nI needed some business casual clothing taken in and hemmed on short notice. That's what I got. I even got a discount for paying cash. Everything seemed great until I got home and tried on the garments. \n\nOn one pair of pants, the legs were hemmed at different lengths (one shorter than the other). On another pair, only the back seam was taken in (rather than the 2 sides), moving the back pockets ridiculously close together. A blouse was taken in too much near the top and not enough at the bottom, causing a lot of pulling across the bust and a weirdly loose fit elsewhere. \n\nBottom line: trust them to clean your clothes, but not to alter them.	0
Really great food here! Always quick, clean and helpful!	1
Gotta love Salsarita's, one of my favorite lunch spots.  Fresh food, great salsa, great prices!  My only suggestion would be to add grilled fish taco's to the menu.	1
"Wow, not a lot of one stars in my review history so here we go......Salsarita's was the first \""Mexican\"" place I tried when I moved to Charlotte....from Phoenix. Needless to say, I had high expectations, even if it was a step above Taco Bell. My first experience was absolutely horrible--I ordered a burrito which was cold, wet and dripping some kind of funky juice. Gross.\n\nI went there a number of times after my initial bad experience and all I can think is no. I went there solely because for awhile were no other Mexican food options Uptown close to me and they offer a number of coupons in the Citpass book. But I've always been disappointed there, even up to last wk when I went there for the last time ever. Maybe it's the fact that the food had no flavor (seriously how does spicy salsa have no flavor?) or the fact that any time I used my check card there and didn't give them a tip (you know since they prepared my food), they would add a $1 or $2 in the tip line.....every....single....time. No bueno, sorry Salsarita's, you are officially Salsash***ty's in my book."	0
I adore this Salsarita's. The food is consistent, it represents the brand well, and to top it all off the staff is fantastic. They have a greeter at the door almost every day and the staff will fulfill any request. I'm a salsa addict, and they will ad as much salsa as I want. Good food, fantastic staff.	1
Good food and great staff!	1
Yikes... as much as I frequent this place, I am puzzled as to why I haven't reviewed it - or maybe I reviewed another location by accident.  Anyways....  This location at Overstreet is super convenient to my office so I do get breakfast AND lunch here often.\n\nDuring the lunch rush, this place can be a mad-house with the line that stretches from the start of the counter out into the Overstreet mall main drag.  There is a dividing wall to keep it all together and make sure no one jumps the line and they recently added some extra pony walls for the dine-in guests to have more privacy and more crowd control (my bet).\n\nThe folks working the line are always nice and the line moves fast (if customers know what they want and how the system works).\n\nThis location also does breakfasts and lunches for offices so sometimes you can see the booths on the side of the restaurant are occupied by items for catering.	1
This is the first restaurant that I went to for dinner when I moved to Charlotte.  We popped in for dinner after a day of moving -  not knowing what to expect.  The food and drinks were delicious.  Great seafood.   Drinks were a little pricey but the atmosphere was worth it.  Service was very good.  Seemed like a secret local place that didn't get too crowded - we walked right in on a Saturday night.	1
The Monticello is a great place to have a civilized breakfast.  They have fresh-squeezed orange juice, a nice Eggs Benedict, and even hearty yellow grits.  It is located in a charming uptown Charlotte neighborhood, near a library and several museums.	1
My soon-to-be-Mother-in-law loves the Dunhill, so we had an awesome dinner at Monticello the night she arrived.\n\nTo tell the truth, I was expecting the worst (Pasta Primavera with Roasted Red Pepper, I hate you). I was more than pleasantly surprised to find several veg appetizers and an inventive vegetarian main on their exclusive menu. \n\nBut, I had to do the obnoxious - ask the chef to put an entree together for me, something I often do at restaurants of this price range. He immediately agreed, asked me a few questions, and disappeared. Not a short time later, a pile of thinly sliced cauliflower quinoa pilaf, garnished with edible orchids and microgreens, and SMOTHERED in a honey-butter broth appeared in front of my bulging eyes. DE-licious, but almost too rich for such a balmy night. He made a point of checking on his creation (which had already found its way into my belly), which was awesome.\n\nService was less formal than I expected, which was fine by me. Very small, old school feel, perfectly dim lighting. This meal reminds me that I have to stop ignoring Uptown cuisine. I hear the brunch is amazing and super affordable. I'll be back.	1
My first meal as a Charlottean was had at this establishment.  I had a taste for fish, and so was pleased to find more than a few appealing options on the dinner menu.  I opted for the trout, preceded by the classic french onion soup.  David X. had the special, a smoked salmon pasta.\n\nThe good: the trout was delightful, well complimented by potatoes and a light tomatoey sauce.  The portions were perfect, aka not too big.  Basically this dish saved the experience for me.\n\nThe ok: the bread was warm (not hot) and the salmon special was pretty good too.  Smoked salmon plus creamy sauce, yum.\n\nThe underwhelming: the french onion soup was not hot.  The cheese was not bubbling or gooey, it was a bit congealed.  Meh.  And, to echo the words of others, the service was more than just pokey.  This was a bit absurd because we were the only people eating in the restaurant.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe, to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much. Maybe they're a bit more on top of their game for breakfast/brunch.  But probably not for dinner.	0
"\""Every Christmas Story Ever Told\"" was slow and not that funny. Spoiled by comedy and improv options in bigger cities, we expected something more fast paced. The first half DRAGGED."	0
Support local! I love this place and they have a special showing of all their shows I think at least once a month called 'Pay What You Can Night'.  That's just icing on the cake.  I went here last night with my girlfriend and our friends and I wasn't really looking for anything fantastic in terms of talent or venue.  Boy was I surprised.  Maybe not so much in terms of the venue but the talent was superb.  The staff and opening host of the show were super friendly.  The place really has a grass roots feel to it and I love it.\n\nI would suggest anyone to come check out a show here and support this local theater.	1
This is a nice cozy place to Explore New (and old) projects. \nI came in on Friday night to see Clayborne Park. Great show, good set up. \nNice drinks\nFriendly staff\n\nI will return!!\n\n\nLOCAL NOT FOR PROFIT	1
I'm glad that a YELP event brought me here. The theater is small and feels really comfortable.\n\nParking is bountiful and free! Yes, the signs may be confusing but the friendly staff is there to ease all concerns. \n\nThere are plenty of drink and snack options and a nice sitting area out front with cozy chairs and tables. When you walk into the theater, the seats are comfy and no matter where you chose you have a good view of the stage...I appreciated that very much!  \n\nI absolutely love supporting local venues and events! The play was very entertaining and it's always good to spend a night out with other Yelpers. \n\n I will definitely be back!	1
"I was recently privileged to receive free tickets for myself and a friend to the play, \""The Divine Sister,\"" courtesy of Yelp Elite.  I have been a fan of Actor's Theatre for several years.  A big plus for this location is free and easily accessible parking.  It offers snacks and drinks for sale that one can take into the theatre.  Sometimes, they offer beer and wine whose names compliment the theme of that evening's production.  ATC also features Cult Movie Mondays in addition to plays and musicals.  This evening's performance of \""The Divine Sister\"" delivered the bawdy, irreverent humor that is characteristic of this theatre.  Another success in a long line of accomplishments.  Thanks to Ben and J.J. for orchestrating a fun and entertaining evening!"	1
"Went to see \""The Great American Trailer Park Musical\"".  The show was awesome - very well produced and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  My bar drink, while pricey, was ...generous, to say the least.  It lasted the entire show! :)\n\nWe will definitely be back - we had a wonderful time and felt very welcomed."	1
Worse than Cans.  And that's saying something!	0
Bar Charlotte is a place where golddiggers go to listen to pop rap and find sugar daddies.  There is a huge dancefloor in the center of the bar with sweaty eighteen year olds bumping and grinding on one another, and half naked girls dancing on bars and tabletops.  I really would not recommend this joint to anyone who has any real taste in music and/or respect for themselves.  The drinks are overpriced, and the girls are underage.  Save your time.	0
In the same (horrible) vein as the next door Have A Nice Day, this place is the definition of 'meat market'.\n\nA dark, dimly lit, sweaty joint where oversexed teenagers and college-age kids go to bump and grind to obnoxious rap and house music.\n\nFor some reason this place is often crowded, and the bathrooms are an exercise in survival, as you either get accosted by drunk or drugged-out people while in line or by the guy in the monkey-suit trying to get you to buy some smell-good or tip him as you're leaving.\n\nHorrible way to spend an evening if you like good music, care to be around people who respect themselves, and if you care to have a meaningful conversation with anyone.	0
In my group of friends we affectionaly refer to this place as where all the fat chicks hang. Why they would attract that kind of crowd and keep the bull in there is BEYOND me. If your a chubby chaser you'll love this place!	0
The bar was really fun!  I had never been to a place like this before and didn't know what to expect.  The drinks and music were really good.  My husband and I had a blast and will definitely be back.	1
Came here twice this weekend. Is it worth the $15 cover on Fridays? Not really. I thought it was a bit too much. If you're into seeing old creepy men looking up your skirt, overpriced drinks, half naked bar girls spanking you with a paddle and acting like a drunk fool on the mechanical bull, well you found a lovely place. The DJ was great though. Nice mix of pop and hip hop music.	0
Wow, I've been here a total of 2 times and both times I've confirmed one thing.  This really isn't somewhere I want to be.  Very young crowd normally in here and I've equated bulls in bars to be something that just doesn't sit well with seeking a more mature crowd.  But I highly doubt the owners of BAR really care because the place does get packed and the youngin's there seem to really love the place.\n\nThe music they play seems to be a good mix, they go through a cycle of typical club hits and some 70's throwback.	0
If you're a black male don't go to Bar Charlotte, they are racist. I was denied entry on 12/21/12. The door man, said I was denied entry because of my boots.On the website it says that the dress code was no construction boots, which I clearly had on Aldo boots. I am a successful, preppy looking black guy. This has never happened to me before at any other club downtown.I cant believe people are still bigots and its about be 2013 :CC	0
I was banned for life from this bar in the Spring of 2006.	0
"The bar itself is good and the servers do a great job but man do the patrons suck! I went once and some guy decided to \""make it rain\"" and started flipping out because dudes were picking up the money. If you're dumb enough to throw a pile of money in to the air you better bet your ass that us broke college kids are going to pick it up! It's also predominantly African American (or at least it was when I went) which is totally fine but some of them looked like gang members. I'm sure I'll get called racist for that but it's the honest truth. I also saw a lot of people getting upset over the dumbest stuff...like getting their shoes stepped on, while standing in the middle of the dance floor! I will say they had a great deal on drinks when I went! $1 for anything!"	0
Upscale soul food.  Cornbread, fried chicken, pork chops, salmon cakes, beef ribs, shrimp and grits, red beans, mac n cheese.  Man I wish there was a joint like this in SF!  My Dad once had the soft shell crab hoagie and almost cried it was sooo good...	1
This is one of the places that you have to go to if you are in Charlotte.  It is local and very unique and you will not find anything like it anywhere else.  \n\nThe food is interesting and the atmosphere is very unique.  I have been there many times and have never been disspointed.	1
Great food, great experience - as an out of town traveler who doesn't like to eat fast food every single day, finding Mert's was a pleasure.  Keeping prices down and providing a great experience is hard at any restaurant but Mert's doesn't skimp when it comes to down home food.  The tables are basic and the look and feel are simple, but this shouldn't stop you from enjoying yourself thoroughly - beginning with their tasty fresh cornbread and continuing into barbeque whether it's ribs or pulled pork.  Although this place is in North Carolina, I was happily surprised by a sauce that didn't overpower with vinegar.  On the whole, I was very happy with Mert's and will definitely go again!	1
If you're new to Charlotte and still adjusting to living in the New South, go to Mert's Heart & Soul in uptown. I can pretty much guarantee that the macaroni and cheese, sweet tea, biscuits, meatloaf and all the other soul food will remind you why Charlotte is a good place to live. \n\nYou can order food from Mert's online, which is a convenient perk. I've been to a couple events catered by Mert's. Mm mm.	1
It's OK.  It's soul food.  The fried chicken was straight forward.  Not likely to go back for just that, as Price's is much better in my opinion.  \n\nI was also able to sample the BBQ pork... It was a tad weird.  My girlfriend accurately pointed out it tasted like curry.   I would steer clear of that. \n\nThe mac and cheese was good because, let's be honest, it's cheese and cheese is good.  The collards were authentic and would get them again.  \n\nOur server was very nice and attentive.  \n\nOverall rating - Just an OK.	0
The fried catfish was perfect.  The sides were good too.  the service was good and the people friendly.  Good place.	1
Well--after I was done, and I didn't finish half my plate I decided not to take home the rest and wished I didn't eat the calories I ate the catfish wasn't worth it. I decided to give them one last try on a slice of pound cake to take home with me. It was wrapped up in Saran wrap and put in a box when i opened it, the texture was dry and hard, and it wasn't big enough to charge almost $4...  there were flies everywhere. I won't be back anytime soon	0
Definitely a great choice for some good southern food that isn't too expensive.  I use to frequent this restaurant almost weekly before relocating to Arizona.  I must say it's one of the main things I miss about living in Charlotte.  Have yet to find a place like it (especially in Arizona)	1
I might move to Charlotte just so I can eat here every week. Both the atmosphere and food is excellent. Superb low country cuisine!\nI wanted to eat everything on the menu and nearly did. I ate the lamb chops - unbelievable! Mac and cheese was very good. The desserts just about killed me but I could not pass on them since I knew I was leaving town the next day. If you are anywhere near Charlotte you have to visit this place.	1
"I am so sorry to rate Mert's so poorly but after the treatment received today I must admit to extreme disappointment in one of my previously favorite Charlotte establishments.  After being invited repeatedly via automated email marketing, I decided to go with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday with lunch at Mert's.  After the most interesting discussion (!) with manager (?) I discovered that I did not have the necessary \""proof\"" to rate the birthday \""deal\"" in spite of having a valid NC driver license clearly showing my date of birth.  In today's economy, I was stunned that any food establishment would take such a tack with a good paying customer!  No worries on seeing my dollars at Mert's ever again.  To many restaurants want my patronage.\n-cheers"	0
"Would never go back!  I was in a party of 3 that was seated at a table for 4, and was then asked if we could move to accommodate another group.  Okay, not a big deal.  However, it all went down hill from there.  Our waitress was nice and polite, but we waited for close to an hour and still nothing showed up at our table.  The people that were sitting at our original table had been served and had already left.  We asked our waitress a number of times why we weren't getting our food, and she kept apologizing and saying \""it's on it's way.\""  But it never came.  It wasn't like we ordered anything unusual, it was eggs, sausage and toast.  The whole thing was weird because others were getting served, and their food was arriving at their table.  Finally, we just said thanks, but no thanks and left."	0
"Food was VERY good. We had a picky eater with us who claimed he did NOT like \""greens.\""  Our waitress Paris suggested he try their greens. He did. He now loves greens! I had some, too, and they were very good. The cornbread is also very good. And the fried chicken. Actually, everything we ate was very good. I ordered the catfish and was reluctant at first since they give you a whole fish and I feared getting the meat off the bones. Nothing to fear; the flesh slides so effortlessly off the bone that it was a pleasure eating it - and quite tasty with that \""special sauce.\"" \n\nParis waited on us hand and foot. She had good suggestions from the menu and she kept our beverage glasses full. She was very friendly and a delight to have serve us.\n\nWe dined outside since there was a nice cool gentle breeze blowing. I wish the outside ambiance was nicer; maybe they can surround it with more potted trees/shrubs to block it from the street. \n\nI would recommend eating here if you like good home-cooked food."	1
Good soul food in a great downtown setting. \nNot the best I've tasted but darn good. \nThe cornbread is outstanding.	1
I went to Mert's for lunch based off the reviews here and recommendations from coworkers.  I wasn't disappointed.  Mert's has an atmosphere that is trying to look like a dive diner, but comfortable and clean as well.  The atmosphere works well here.   I ordered the jumbo chicken wings with greens and mac-n-cheese as my sides.  The chicken wings were big and fried crispy, the greens were very tasty as was the mac-n-cheese.  The cornbread has to be some of the best I have ever had.  The greeens and mac-n-cheese were not the best I have ever had, but they were right up towards the top of my list.  The place was fairly busy as I expected and the service was OK.  I recieved my drink and food promptly, but my server never checked back.  I never really needed anything so I didn't suffer, but I can't give 5 stars because of that.  If you like good home cooked goodness then Mert's is the place to go.	1
Had breakfast here, super yummy southern biscuits!  Looks a little dingy but that's the charm.	1
Always friendly, the staff here will usually go out of their way to make sure you have a great meal. Everything I've tried is great, but special note goes to the cornbread and the catfish. The collard greens are also great, slightly tangy and with a good feel, not overcooked. This is soul food without going overboard on salt and fat. Of course, they are there, just not as much as some soul food places.  I wish they had pie.	1
Wanted to like this place. Staff very friendly. Reasonable prices. Quick service. \nBut plates were dirty. Table dirty. Food just OK.	0
Great comfort food!  Really cool find downtown near the train, museums, etc.  Love it!	1
Extremely tasty food.  I inhaled my plate of salmon cakes, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  The cornbread was tasty and buttery.  The service was fast and friendly, the sweet tea was syrupy sweet and the interior is very entertaining.\nMy sister enjoyed a dessert - was it sweet potato cake?  Something that seemed a bit odd to me.\nAs far as uptown southern goes, I'd say Mert's is your spot for casual, friendly, quick but still very tasty - a nice place to hang out with friends.  King's is better for dressy and classy.	1
SUMMARY:  This was about the 6th time I've dined at Mert's.  First time since joining Yelp.  I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.  \n\nDETAILS:\nWe were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right, and the appetizer (soul sampler) came out in a very reasonable time.  But it took at least another 20 minutes (maybe even 30) to get our entrees: BBQ with sides, and blackened pork chops with sides. And while the sides and chops all got good comments, we did NOT like the very molasses-heavy BBQ.  This is nothing like I've ever eaten in North or South Carolina (and I'm a native).  That needs to be revamped or better disclaimed on the menu.\n\nAnyway, so unlike my previous visits, I left very disappointed and unfortunately, left my out-of-town friends with a bad impression of what has usually been a good place.	0
All I can say is YUMMM!!! My fiance and I are new to Charlotte so this was our first try at true Southern style soul food. Mert's was not a disappointment. The service was friendly. Very cozy southern feeling atmosphere. Very casual and chill and best of all, not overpriced! \n\nBiggest recommendations: The cornbread is to die for!!! OMG! The chicken is wonderful and the mac and cheese is soooo good! \n\nDefinitely worth checking out!	1
I had the pleasure of taking a coworker to Mert's for her first time today. We had an amazing lunch! The place was packed but we didn't have to wait. The waitresses were super busy with big parties who were there for their Sunday afternoon meals but were no less charming and friendly.\n\nI've been once before and I highly recommend the Fried Green Tomato appetizer that I had last time. The chicken is excellent as is the cornbread. I had Salmon Cakes today and they were out of this world! The mac and cheese is delicious as are the greens and green beans. I could have drank a gallon of their sweet tea but I'm glad I stuck with two. We shared a piece of German Chocolate Cake for dessert. I was good and the whipped cream on the side just melted in my mouth.\n\nI don't know why I waited so long to make a return visit but trust me, I'm going to make it a priority to get back there soon!	1
This place serves excellent Low Country/Country Cooking dishes at reasonable prices - at least the prices are reasonable at lunch, $7 - $9 for a entree which comes with 2 sides and corn bread.\n\nThe Fried Chicken is excellent, The Ribs are as well, and I love the Salmon Cakes. The Fried Catfish is good, any of the Po' Boys are worth trying. The Fried Green Tomato app is nice, not as tart as some, but still good. The Collards are not to my liking, and  I've tried them twice.\n\nThe Shrimp and Grits are nice, rich and creamy. But, I was disappointed in the Shrimp Creole, was bland and watery. Service here is excellent, even when this place is busy, which it always seems to be. The ambiance is homey, though it can get a little loud.	1
First let me say FREE PARKING!!!! The food was great the service was excellent the potato salad was just wonderful. The staff was super friendly the atmosphere was perfect.	1
This place is really good.  The staff was great, food fresh, and a great menu.  \n\nI will always return whenever in Downtown.	1
To sum up my recent trip to Mert's...pretty delicious food yet poor customer service. The only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread. Our waiter was very inconsistent and neglecting us. There were at least four tables with more than three customers which received their entrees before my girlfriend and I did. It will be a very long time before I go to Merts again.	0
GOOD food! I recommend the salmon cakes, greens, mac n cheese. Their cornbread is amazing, as well!\nThe ambiance is something out of an old soul's home...amazing pictures of celebrities who've been in town & the soul music overhead is so good!\nThe staff is friendly & attentive.\nKeep in mind, they stay pretty busy for lunches & dinners.\nWhat's REALLY good is their New Year's brunch, every Jan. 1st. $20 for all you can eat buffet!	1
"This is one of those places you can go at lunch time and run into everyone from your local car detailer to power-brokers like the former CEO of NationsBank (now Bank of America).  The food is absolutely delish, but be warned - your clothes and hair will smell of southern-fried goodness when you leave. If you are craving good ole soul food - aka southern \""comfort foods\"" this place is a must-try!"	1
Cool, casual service and the home of probably the best cornbread I have ever had in my LIFE. In my view, you can't go wrong with Mert's. Happy eating!	1
The waitress was very nice and the food was delicious.  I had the fried whiting, home fries and coleslaw.  The whiting had a few bones but cooked perfect and my husband asked me to please bring him a piece of red velvet cake back to Texas.  How's that for service?  Nice place and I will go back.	1
This place was amazing! It looks like a little dive-bar in the heart of downtown Charlotte, but once you walk in you know you're home! Everyone was super friendly and happy to explain anything on the menu or make recommendations. I had the boneless fried chicken (how do they make plain-ol' chicken taste SO incredible?!) and couldn't decided between coleslaw, mashed potatoes with gravy, or macaroni and cheese and the waitress suggested the two starches... I was sceptical but couldn't have been happier once my meal came. Oh, and be sure to start with the warm cornbread and honey butter!	1
This is the only restaurant I had the chance to visit when I was in Charlotte last weekend and I was not disappointed.  I was warned that it is a hole in the wall, but it's not.  Just a casual restaurant.\n\nWe arrived around 2pm on a Saturday and were quickly seated.  After ordering, our food arrived about 10 minutes later.  I had the fried chicken with mac n cheese and greens.  And because I'm greedy and have no shame I also got a side of mashed taters (just so I could try them).\n\nI really enjoyed my food.  It was hot and delicious.  The mac n cheese was very cheesy and satisfying.  The mashed taters were lumpy like I like it.  And the cornbread was good too.  A nice little loaf with some creamy, sweet butter.\n\nI think my meal was about 10 bucks with a drink.   My only complaint is that the portions were kinda small.  Maybe I'm just used to bigger portions in Atlanta, but I could have enjoyed 1/4 more food.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly.	1
You get a lot of food - for a very good price.  Meal starts of with giant steaming mini cornbreads.  Order an entree and get choice of two sides (mac and cheese, potatoes, fries etc).  \n\nFried chicken was great.  Sides were somewhat disappointing.  Cornbread was amazing!	1
In my opinion EPIC FAIL ...... I'm from Charlotte and my first time going there was last week and boy was i not impressed. I guess when soul food come to my mind i think of greatness because I'm from the south, it could be a lot better.	0
The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again.	0
"I rarely give bad reviews, but this was a pretty horrible food experience. My cousin was in town today from Seattle and requested \""good soul food.\"" I've heard good things about Mert's, but have not had an opportunity to try. I figured it would be a good opportunity to show my cousin some good souther food. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The fried chicken was pretty bland. It seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long. The collard greens were insanely salty. Instant high blood pressure for sale! :( I ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard. I have to say that the corn bread was absolutely amazing, which makes no sense that the rest of the food was so unappetizing."	0
When we first moved to Charlotte, NC from Savannah, I was really looking forward to trying Southern food here. A lot of people suggested Mert's. One word-YUCK! We ordered simple items. Fried chicken, macaroni and cheese and collards. The chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland. The service wasn't great either. She leaned over our table,with her butt in the other patrons face the entire time. Not impressed. I went a second time just in case they were having a bad day. I ordered catfish with okra and tomatoes. Again-YUCK! The catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it. The okra and tomatoes were alright. Still searching for a great southern restaurant.	0
Yummy true soul food! I always get the vegetable plate when I go because I can't choose between the many (all amazing) sides. The collared greens are the best I've ever had! Everything is salty, but that's expected at soul food restaurants. Mert's is always crowded, but you're usually seated quickly. Quickness of service always depends on the server. Seating is pretty close to other tables, but not a biggie. My biggest turn-off is downtown parking...you have to park in a parking garage and walk to the restaurant. Still a favorite of mine!	1
Definitely hidden. They serve good brunch on the weekends and you won't wait in a ridiculous line full of degenerates.   Make sure to get their biscuits.	1
I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat.	1
The service here sucks. We went there and they got us the main meal before the appetizer and bread.  When I requested to have my appetizer first, the waitress replied that they are expecting lots of people from the convention and they are trying to get us out as fast as possible. I immediately left. \n\nNever going to go back again.	0
Horrible!!	0
The food was great!  Waitress was funny.  But I still like Paschal's fried chicken better.	1
This place was just OK for me.  I was pretty disappointed with the fried chicken because I felt it could have been more flavorful and more fried.  I was surprised because I would have expected more. The catfish my dad and sister ordered was way more fried than the chicken my mom and me had ordered. Also, don't expect the fish to be a fillet. It's a whole fish.\n\nEven though our server was very friendly, I was also very disappointed with him. It was rare that he came by to check on us and he had also forgotten to give us the corn bread. When he wasn't there to check on us, we resorted to asking a different waitress that walked by for boxes and the check. However, she didn't bother, probably because we weren't her table. Rudeness...\n\nOverall experience could have been better, but at least we tried it.	0
"I wish I could give half stars because I'd truly rate Mert's as a 3.5 (or even 3.75) out of  5. But to be fair, I will round up to 4. \n\nI have been to Mert's four times in the past year and have been pleased with each visit. The service and ambiance is great. The art and music promotes an inviting warm home-style environment.\n\nI'm only giving this place 3.5 stars because of the food. It is tasty, but not the best southern cuisine I've had. I was raised on southern cooking and am aware of variations in seasoning and techniques for one location to another. However, although good, the food does not satisfy my appetite when I'm in the mood for \""soul food\"" or southern cooking. I'm sure this varies from one person to the next. So, try it out yourself!   :)\n\nAlso, I've had the catfish and chicken here, but my favorite meat at Mert's is the ribs."	1
"My husband and I love food, saw all the great reviews and decided to check Mert's out. We started with the BBQ beef ribs and when my husband put a piece in his mouth, he made a sound that startled me! Lol. I was like what's wrong and he was like, \""Geez, this is awesome!\"" I had the whiting, which was perfectly seasoned. He had the salmon cakes meal. Plates were cleaned! Great find. Oh, make sure you park in the lot where they are located as this is the only lot they can offer validation for. We did save room for desert. Peach cobbler was perfect, but the strawberry cake was way too sweet. I love sweets but even this was like an overdose."	1
Had the Shrimp Po Boo.  I wish I know that it would be spicy I would have asked them to hold the spice.  Even the Home Fries where spicy.  I understand that it's southern home cooking, however other items on the menu warn that it's spicy.  I understand it's not a four star restaurant, however the batter on the popcorn shrimp could have more crispy.  Perhaps the fryer was not to temperature when they sunk them.  Despite the spiciness of the potatoes they where fresh and not cooked that long, although personally I do like crispy home fries.  Having said that portion was good size, price average with other restaurants in the area.  Service was my biggest issue.  While the waitress did keep checking back to see if we where ready to order, however she never asked if I would like another Ice Tea.  I needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention.	0
While visiting Charlotte for the DNC, I must say that Merts made me feel as if I never left home.  I dined there for breakfast and two dinners.\n\nFor breakfast I had two eggs, bacon, biscuits and home fries.  Everything was very enjoyable but where Merts really shines is at night.\n\nFor dinner, I had the salmon cakes on one occasion and the fried catfish on the other.  On the side, I had yams and greens and a sweet tea to wash it all down.  I managed to save enough room for dessert and enjoyed a slice of sweet potato cake.  The cake was moist and delicious and the frosting was nothing short of decadent.\n\nMerts portions are huge.  If only my hotel had a mini fridge, I could have taken my leftovers back to my room.\n\nThe wait staff is super friendly.  As for its location, Merts is very convenient to lots of hotels in downtown Charlotte.	1
"UMM, UMM GOOD! I had to say that in capital letters just to get my point across how good Mert's is! I've been to a few soul food restaurants, where they claim \""everything is homemade\"" but when it comes to Mert's that's exactly what you get! Homemade biscuits and even ..are you ready for this? Homemade butter!! The beef ribs fall off the bone and the mac n cheese is the real deal, no boxed stuff here! \n\nThe desserts, what do you choose when you have a choice of German Chocolate, Red Velvet, Sweet Potato, Coconut Cake, Pound cake, Banana Pudding, along with Peach, Apple, & Blueberry Cobblers! The prices are reasonable, they also serve breakfast on Sat. & Sum morns which is awesome is well!  Robin the waitress is a joy to have while visiting!"	1
After eating a disappointing, overpriced dinner the night before, my group was thrilled to find this sweet spot in downtown Charlotte!\nWe loved the quirky decor and immediately felt the warm fuzzies for our energetic waitress.\nWe were there for breakfast, but I personally was excited to hear that there were meat and veggies choices available too.\nGood flavored coffee was a welcome beginning , as was the yummy cornbread and crunchy biscuits.\n5 stars would have been given , but some in our party said their omelette choices were just ok.\nMy non traditional meal of salmon patties, collard greens and home fries was yummy!  Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I look forward to a return to this place.  Egg rolls filled with collards and black eyed peas and roasted veggies are on my list of things to try next time.  Gourmet soul food at its best!	1
I really wanted to like this place.  It had cool old wood signs and their original menu on a chalkboard, and friendly welcoming staff.  The menu has a lot of good sounding items, but the problem for me was I was expecting some good Southern cookin with chicken fried chicken or chicken fried steak.  So, I went for the fried chicken breast and it was just blah, dry and no flavor.  The saving grace which earned the extra star was that the side veggies were good and the cornbread was delicious.	0
This is the best soul restaurant!!! The soul rolls are a must have. The waitresses are so nice and helpful and are quick to fix a mix up.  I loved the place. Any time I'm in Charlotte, this is a must have!	1
The cornbread was the best part of the meal, all the other menu items I tried was sub-par.	0
My buddy Bob and I were in town for a convention this week.  Wanted to go local and have a meal that I wouldn't get up in NJ.  Merts did not disappoint.\nIt's not upscale, fancy, yuppified, or pretentious.\nEverything was a little unique to Merts.\nWaitress sold us on her favorites which, for us, was dead on.  The beef ribs and pulled pork melt in your mouth delicious with an outstanding tomato and vinegar based sauce.\nSides of okra, collards, Mac & cheese paired well. The sampler platter was very unique for a BBQ joint and is a must to try if your are willing to try something new.\nThe Corn bread and sweet butter was a great compliment to the meet.  \nIt's half the price of Roosters up the street and you will not leave hungry.  The very next day we were craving for more.	1
Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  I used to live uptown and would come here for lunch often.  I'm not a cornbread fan but I do love their cornbread. \nI also finally had their chicken tenders over the weekend and they were excellent.  I debated between the salmon cakes or the chicken tenders and decided to try something different and I'm glad I did.\nI had the mac and cheese and collard greens as my accompaniments and I was pretty full, but couldn't take a doggie bag since I was headed to SMG for a movie :(\n\nThis is the place I try to take out-of-towners and point tourists towards since to me this is Charlotte cooking and it has a great location uptown on College.	1
Not only was the food wonderful but the staff are friendly.  The ribs are sooooo tender and the red beans & rice are fabulous.  The cornbread is YummmmmY.	1
I love this place.  There was a time when I ate here twice a week.  The food is amazing and very true to its Gullah/Carolina roots of down-home, Southern cuisine.  Everything is fresh, delicious, and remarkably low-priced.	1
"Ok, just to dispel any misunderstandings, this isn't true \""soul food\"" - it's great southern cooking.\n\nWe have been here three times since living in Charlotte and continue to come back for more. The mac-and-cheese is to die for, and every entree we've had has been terrific. I usually get the fried chicken tenders but opted for the barbecue ribs last time I was here, and was not disappointed. The cornbread is a huge plus but is usually too much for me to finish. Shrimp and Grits is an all-time favorite for me as well. If you can, save room for dessert. If they have it, the german chocolate cake is a total win.\n\nGo for al fresco dining if you can (weather permitting) - nothing like sitting outside and watching the sites of Uptown Charlotte."	1
Excellent! Home cooking, friendly service and the pies are amazing!!	1
I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for $6, I got 4 slices of skinny green tomatoes, deep fried and over battered.  Tried their fried chicken, it wsa crispy but why is the portion so small. The table cloth is grimy and sticky..\n\nTry a Waffle house and I think you'll have a better dining experience.	0
Food was on point and very delicious,  however our waitress was NOT the deal. He wasn't very friendly and added extra food to the order, repetitive of things that I did order causing me to have lots of the same things.  He didn't explain how orders came and often heard us call him only to pause and glance in our direction. We were NOT rude or anything of that nature. Greens could have been a lil better instead of like leaves but other than that,  I loved it. I won't let that one black monkey stop my show! !! I will be back!!!!	1
"This is my second visit to Mert's (the first time Yelp wouldn't let me be great and check in). They decor is artisy and eclectic and includes a diner style dessert counter. (My inner fatty girl rejoices) if you are on one of those \""starve myself of carbs because they are the devil\"" diets do yourself a favor and skip this place because the cornbread is a MUST! \n\nI got the fried jumbo chicken wings which were delicious, the greens, which were flavorful but not very juicy like I prefer mine. The only disappointment from my meal were my yams. Basically because I had more juice than potato :-( \n\nStaff was friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be returning for some banana pudding."	1
Service was great! Servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable. However, the food..... Sucked. The collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt. The corn bread (which is what they are known for) was extremely dry and tasted like it came out of a box. We waited over an hour and a half to be seated (granted we did have a party of 7) only to be disappointed. This was not good Soul Food at all.	0
Deeeeeeelicious!  Split the pork BBQ plate w/collards & yams with a friend who got the salmon cakes.  Both were wonderful.\n\nWe're moving in as soon as possible.  Or at least going for breakfast tomorrow morning!	1
I thought I'd avoid the crowd by dining a little late but the place was PACKED! I love the look and feel of the restaurant although it was a bit warm inside. I asked for a table outside and had my pick...probably a little chilly for some but just right for me. \n\nSweet tea and a corn bread CAKE were brought out right away. It was the size of a small pound cake and I knew I was in for trouble! I ordered the salmon cakes, greens and mac & cheese. Salmon cakes had lost their crispness on the outside, but the flavor was delicious. The greens were leafy and large and JUST RIGHT! And god bless the mac & cheese. Oozing with buttery cheesy goodness and a touch of the topping that had baked up brown and I may as well have died and gone to heaven.\n\nOf course I could not finish all the food. But my server offered a box without my asking. Great food and great service.	1
I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.	0
Let me first say how delicious the cornbread was!\n\nThe catfish that I  ordered was a fillet with a lot of batter on it although it was seasoned nice it was just to much breading for me ( and i thought i was going to get the whole fish not the fillet). The yams were out of a can so that was a major let down. The mac and cheese was not to my liking at all it tasted like it was made with velvetta and other cheap cheeses.The fried chicken was lightly fried and not crispy either but the collard greens were well seasoned.\n\nSeems like a tourist spot to me. The staff was friendly and I liked the crowd I didn't get a chance to try the homemade cakes although they looked pretty tasty.\n\nI can at least say that I tried this place :)	0
This review is based on the BBQ sandwich and macaroni - awesome. The sandwich is a perfect blend of tender meat and sauce. It's not overkill with meat falling all over the place. If you want a sloppy concession stand type sandwich this isn't the place for you. However, if you want a bbq sandwich you can brag about when someone asks about NC bbq, this is the spot. Oh, the macaroni is ridiculous. I believe it's homemade. Yummy!	1
Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off.	0
Delicious Southern food!\n\nThe cornbread was so good. I got BBQ Beef Ribs, with Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens, and Yams. The ribs were full of yummy NC vinegary flavor, the mac was cheesy and good, the collard greens were tangy and flavorful, and the yams were savory and sweet. For my first dinner in Charlotte, I was def satisfied.\n\nPrices are decent, and the service is good.\n\nParking can be a little tough. My best suggestion would be to park in one of the nearby structures, bc there really isn't street parking.	1
"This restaurant seemed perfect online but when I went there  it was totally different experience. \nAs soon as stepped a foot in the restaurant I was in the face with bad smell which was combination of old frid fosh and burnt oil. This smell will stick to you for four to five  hours at least.\nThe corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant. \nI ordered chicken wings which was cold and \""rubbery\"".\nMy friend ordered po-boy chicken  tenders tge bread was old and hard consequendly  he couldn't eat his sandwich."	0
Great place to experience home cooked style southern food. Yams are delicious along with salmon fish cakes and sweet potato cake for dessert	1
Great fried chicken and excellent salmon patties with spicy remoulade sauce. Cornbread is very light and tasty. Service was very friendly and welcoming. Vegetable sides were on the lighter side and delicious. Has a diner feel with good Motown and soul music.	1
Love this place!  Delicious homemade food.  I have been here for breakfast about 5 times.  It is my go to breakfast/brunch spot when in Charlotte.  I always bring friends and they love it as well.  Fresh eggs, delicious mac and cheese, corn bread.  They have always been fine with altering and substituting ingredients, which is always nice.  Servers are super fast and friendly!	1
The cornbread was good but everything was without season and it was fruit Flys (along with the traps) everywhere! The collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes. I would not recommend this to anyone if you are in the mood for good food.	0
I had the beef ribs and fried chicken combo/ mac n cheese &greens side\nMy wife had fried catfish and fried chicken combo/ potato salad $ fries side my daughter had the kid chicken tenders/mac n cheese & fries side. Were from south Jersey and have eaten at a lot of restaurants of all kinds. Hands down this is the best tasting soul food restaurant we've eaten at yet. We will be back for seconds and thirds. Excellent taste and portions absolutely nothing to complain about even the price was reasonable. You've gotta try this place if you can.	1
Mert's is very good soul food. Came here with a friend last week. It took a minute for the cornbread to come out because it was hot and fresh out the kitchen. I'm not a big cornbread fan, but slap some butter on this stuff and it's quite amazing.\n\nOur server recommended the ribs, and so I ordered them with the yardbird, mac and cheese and greens. All around great. The ribs were falling off the bone, the yardbird and very good. The mac and cheese was stellar and the greens were some of the best I've tasted in North Carolina.\n\nI finished my meal with the peach cobbler, which was fine, but not great. I kinda wished they had more chocolate options here. I would most certainly come here again.	1
When my friend and I walked in, we were immediately greeted by several people. Everyone was smiling and nice, and we were given a table outside. The waitress said she could tell our chairs were uncomfortable, so she switched them for better seats. I had the beef ribs and chicken breast quarter, with yams and macaroni and cheese. The ribs were different than I typically like (vinegary maybe) and the chicken was a little dry, but I loved how it wasn't overly salty like southern food sometimes is. The cornbread was good, but not as sweet as I like. The peach cobbler was different, but good. I got it to go and forgot it in my car so I didn't eat much. It was a good lunch with beautiful weather, so I'd go back.	1
If your having a taste for soul food this a place to go. I've been here a few times and the food has never disappointed me. For the price point their portions are well off, enough for me to finish the rest the next day.  I recommend the fried chicken, catfish, yams and mac-n-cheese. I have always gone during slower to times so I've had quick service. The servers here are down to earth and tentative, but if you come here it's just for good food and laughs in my eyes. Be sure to visit this place at least once.	1
I bought a Livingsocial deal for Mert's. The place is crowed for brunch on Sat. We were quickly seated. The cornbreads were very delicious and warm. Don't take the cornbread to go because it isn't that good when it is a take out.  I got the salmon cake with two sides mac and cheese and mash potatoe with gravy. The side orders were good sizes. They weren't stingy on the gravy enough for your mash potatoe. My dad had the catfish and the beef ribs. The beef ribs were good but catfish was more on the fishy side. Overall, we enjoyed Mert's. The staffs were all very friendly.The quarter leg was also good. The nice young lady who waited on us was fast and nice. It was a busy day and she even remembered to refill my drink. If you work at downtown, give Mert's a try.	1
Very inconsistent.	0
Best soul food in Charlotte! Vegetables are flavored deliciously, must go! Great fried catfish and chicken!!	1
Southern plates made in the south by a chef who was raised on this food specifically? You see it in every detail. \n\nThe jumbo chicken wings, salmon cakes, cornbread, macaroni and cheese, potato salad and okra was absolutely to die for. Food came out faster than I could have ever imagined. Seriously, about 3 minutes after we ordered. Piping hot, full of flavor and delivered by an over-the-top waiter with a smile.\n\nRefills came quickly and our time in Charlotte will always be remembered thanks to Mert's. The hostess was a tad rude, which started everything off a little odd, but everything rebounded from that. Still 5 stars.\n\nIf you want a hearty dinner for an extremely small price tag, go here. You can personally message me and thank me after. I wouldn't be upset.	1
Although I have been using yelp for many years, this is my first review. My husband and I went to Mert's on Sunday morning around 1015. It was not full so we were seated immediately, right next to the server station. We watched server after server, at least 5 of them pass our table to put orders in the computer, server after server chat with each other, not one addressed our table. Not one said I will be your server I will be with you shortly. Not one said would you like some water. Not one said let me find who your server is. Not one. This went one for 15 minutes before we decided to get up and leave!  The service is terrible!!!	0
Hands down best cornbread I've ever had.  It's everything you want cornbread to be:  warm, caky, sweet, and last but not least de-freakin-licous!  Ok, now on to the food.  I've been here twice and each time I couldn't force myself to order anything but the fried chicken.  When I go to a Southern restaurant serving soul food I have a really hard time ordering anything else.  The chicken is moist, macaroni is rich, and the collards are full of flavor.  \n\nBoth times we've been, the place has been packed.  They do a nice job getting you seated in a reasonable amount of time.  There isn't much of a waiting area though so it gets rather cramped when you do have to wait.	1
I spoke with Veronica the general manager. She apologized profusely for the mix up and assured me that she spoke with the staff. Ultimately, there was confusion about who was responsible for our table. She indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice.\n\nShe invited me back to the restaurant. Based in her response, I will give them another try and hopefully add more stars. I was so disappointed because I was hungry and really wanted to try the seafood omelette.	0
If this is great Southern Food then I am a craw dad .  The Okra was not fresh and rather tasteless , the fish special wasn't fresh and was small and the cabbage was mushy.  I was married to a Mobile girl and this is not what I expected for Soul Food.. But it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent.	0
Loved our waitresses!  They were fun and personal with attitude!  Food was so so. The BBQ ribs were small beef short ribs with a thin vinegar based sauce.  The Mac n cheese was the best!  The collard greens were hard and vinegar based.  The peach cobbler was just so so.  Atmosphere ans waitresses are the best part of the restaurant.	1
Our table agreed that the best part of this meal was the corn bread. Every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable. One person in our party of seven has said that he will return to give them another try.  The rest of us will not be back	0
Over all the food was good. I ordered chicken and 2 sides. Collard greens and mashed potato.  I went on a thursday night and had to wait about 35min for food I ordered to go. The place was packed so that normally says that the place is good. And I don't have any complaints besides the wait. Good news was they had a bar next door so I went and had a beer then came back to get food. But had to wait another 15min. Well I actually did not like the greens it was very plain no flavor. The mashed potato was very good though. I would deff go here again for a cheap light meal. Oh yes I also ordered banana pudding. That was ok nothing I would order again.	1
Let me start off by saying that my experience was horrible and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  My wife and I came to Charlotte celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Mert's per recommendation of her supervisor and because of the high praise the restaurant received online.  We were seated in a reasonable time but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at 7:15pm and were given some bland cornbread.  At 8:15pm we were still waiting for our order to be prepared (cooked)...not brought to us...PREPARED! Now mind you no one even a word of apology or an update on the status of our food during the wait. Finally I had enough and walked out. Our waitress and management still did not offer an apology despite seeing us leave the restaurant visibly upset. We left and walked to E2 (emeralds restaurant) and received the best meal and customer service I've ever experienced. I'd recommend all the other restaurants in downtown Charlotte before Mert's. :-/	0
Good ole southern food\n MOST of the staff is awesome its like seeing an old friend with a famaliar face.. great cakes and pies and the chicken is what I live for..! Merts has an amazing down home southerm charm feeling.. it can drown out all the excitement of center city with its cool southern down home meets the city vibe..  dones sometimes smell like grease but I still love it!!	1
We had to come try this place out since it had amazing reviews. We were disappointed TWICE!..The service was great both times.  We had carryout the first time and ate in the second.  The place was busy both times and the Chicken wings were the only thing that was consistently good.  The Collard Greens are the toughest and tasteless greens I've ever had and the Mac & Cheese is so so.  My Husband had the fried whiting and it was tasty but he also didn't like the sides and said the greens were gritty. We both agree that the cornbread is delicious.  I would return for the Chicken Wings only.	0
"HORRIBLE customer service! (Not the waitress). The food was warm, had little flavor, and a simple menu item that read differently from what was expected was not offered to be negotiated. From where I'm from, when something reads \""smoked turkey\"" you are expecting just that, not smoked turkey sausage (round slices of a turkey sausage). Even when given the pass of a misunderstanding, the manager (owerners daughter as she so often identify herself) was more interested in making HER point than making sure out of state customers who went out of their way to visit the establishment....and checked-in on Facebook have an enjoyable experience. She was sarcastic & unprofessional. Sorry my family had THAT experience."	0
This place is amazing! The cornbread is perfectly buttery and moist, and the barbeque is seasoned just right and is making my mouth water just thinking about it! The staff there was so friendly and personable, and did a really nice job at checking on us- but not being overbearing. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a delicious soul food meal!	1
Cool, casual atmosphere set in the heart of downtown Charlotte.  The only cornbread I've ever had that's the equal of this is served at Club 83 in Memphis, and I've NEVER had green beans this good!	1
I came last Saturday on a whim. I had been passing this place on my walks around the area. Seeing all those people buzzing in there enticed me. It didn't take long to be seated, considering how many people were in there. I ordered fried chicken ( breast and wing), macaroni and cheese, and red beans with a lemonade. Mistakenly, they brought wings and I immediately alerted the waitress. Then, I received my order. Everything except for the red beans was scrumptious. For dessert, I selected German chocolate cake. It was not extravagantly delicious but nice. Next time, I'll get for my sides macaroni and cheese with potato salad, then finish with yellow cake and chocolate icing.	1
Horrible service!!! Server forgot to put our order in. Came back 30 minutes later with lame lie. Another 20 minutes later still no food, not even apps. Hostess also provided 2 new lame lies. We left and will never go back. Dishonest staff ruined it for me. Honesty would  have gone over better. Went to Tupelo Honey Cafe instead. Awesome service and FOOD!!	0
Waited 45 minutes to get in at 8pm on Friday, that wasn't the bad part though..\nWaited 30 minutes for our drinks (our waitress didn't even show up, the host had to bring them) and after that, 2 hours for our food. By time it got to us we were so sick of waiting and so tired since it was 11pm that we could barely eat. \n\n\nThe food wasn't particularly good, I ordered the chicken and macaroni with green beans. Chicken was dry, green beans under seasoned and bland. The macaroni was good, they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay. They got two orders wrong in our party of 4 though.\n\nThe waitress apologized profusely and we received a discount for our wait but I will not return to this place again. \n\n\nTL;DR\n\nOver three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service.	0
It was great. Our waitress was definitely a good host. I highly recommend this place if your in Charlotte. Mac and cheese was on point. I didn't care for the collard greens but overall we all enjoyed our meal and service.	1
Service was extremely slow. We sat at our table for quite a while before we were waited on. Once we ordered the server brought cornbread right away. It's good but, not what I was expecting. We both ordered the fried chicken. It was cold and soggy. The mac and cheese was good but again, it's Mac and cheese. The server was really sweet but not attentive to the table. Food was just ok. Wouldn't go back.	0
The worst restaurant ever! It doesn't matter if the food tastes good or not.. The service is the worst! Lazy and slow as ever!	0
Amazing restaurant! Great food, Good Service & friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be coming here again. If you are in North Carolina you need to visit this place :)	1
Not the best soul good I've ever eaten. My collard greens mixed with mustards? Were tough. The fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about. Salmon cakes were good. Mac n cheese can pass for soul food. Yams were great! Corn bread mediocre, overall it was okay. Don't believe the hype, especially if you were brought up on Mamas soul food cooking.	0
This was my second and most likely last time attending this restaurant.  Reason for this statement is our waitress topped off my glass of water with water from a glass not a pitcher. Who fills a patrons glass like that?	0
"Soul food is ok...needs more seaoning and to be drained of grease. My entire rating is based off the customer service which was very rude and disrespectful for me as a customer. The wait was long and don't try to make reservations because they dont take on weekends.  The waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering. ...\""imma take yall drink order and food order at the same time so who first?\"" (Her exact words). I live in charlotte and have been here prior to this visit but will never return again. This was by far the worst soul food experience."	0
I love this place.  Great price, great service, and awesome food.  The cornbread alone is worth the trip.   I also loved their fried chicken.  It's a bit noisy but that's because it is is full of happy diners.  Perfect spot for some casual Southern cooking.	1
Are you hungry? Need to get some real savory food on your belly? Want to spend your money at a family owned restaurant?\nGo to  Mert's Heart and Soul. Save room for dessert too!\nWe are visiting Charlotte and on the hunt for lunch downtown, yelpers you are the Best. You said this place was good and that's the truth. \nWe ordered the red beans and rice, the lunch special, smoked pork chop, and the ribs appetizer. All were delicious.  We had iced tea for our beverages and peach cobbler for dessert. Samantha took care of us and is an ambassador for the establishment. She suggested we return and I said Thanksgiving time. Well, she said the owner closes the place on Thanksgiving day to serve the homeless.\nWell I can only say this. I'm happy I had lunch there and if you try it I believe you will to.	1
My favorite place to eat in Charlotte!  I swear they must sneak my grandmother down from heaven to work in the kitchen.  Great Southern food and lovely service.  They first time In was there they refused to serve my friend a salad, insisting on fresh southern veggies instead.  They were just kidding I think.	1
Gritty greens,everytime!...Need I say more?? Not what they use to be.	0
Had a pretty good Groupon for this place- wife enjoyed the collards, fried chicken was finger licking good. Avoid the soup which was reaally a cup of broth. And steer clear of the Carolina Blond beer yuck. Loved our sassy southern waitress & the corn bread she brought us. We will be back.	1
Lunch comes with corn bread. I really enjoyed the bbq pork ribs, I highly recommend them! The ribs seemed to have been marinated in sauce over night then they add a vinaigrette type sauce over them which really packs on the flavor. If you have room for desert def get the banana cake, I am a banana pudding fanatic so the cake was right up my alley! The cake was very moist and smooth only 1 word could describe it- delicious! \nMy only issue with this place is the fruit flies, sorry the little flies are a big problem. They need to fix that! If it wasn't for that I would've given 5/5 stars	1
THANK YOU, Yelpers!! Maybe the best home cookin' I've eaten, and that covers a lot!  Beef spare ribs, fried chicken, shrimp & grits, salmon, collards, black eyed peas, Mac n cheese, slaw, and oh the cornbread that was served first!!  Seriously wanted a slice of one of the half doz cakes but, alas, no room. Guess we'll just have to come back.... And we sat next to a friendly lady sipping a beer in a Pilsner glass thru a straw; that's a first. Wish we could clone this place!	1
Took my boyfriend for first time.  Waitress kept going outside smoking and smelled like ashtray upon returning to table.  Cornbread good.  Chicken good.  BBQ was disgusting and swimming in grease.  Potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat.  I was embarrassed that I had bragged to my bf about how good things were and then had such a terrible experience.   And it was over $30 for lunch.  Not worth the drive, parking, or time.	0
Slow service con this cold and wet Monday. The servers just didn't have it together and neither did the cooks as my chicken was seasonless and my Mac and cheese was cold. The only thing you can expect from Mert's is inconsistency.	0
I have been told this place was great for years. I finally went and in and was mad at myself for waiting so long before finally going in there. The food was fantastic. An easy atmosphere, a menu with a good variety. Definitely understand why it's always busy during lunch time. I highly recommend it.	1
Great food great staff never again kings kithen! Jim nobles close shop! Thank you guys a great place great food!	1
Excellent down home cooking. As a business traveler several clients recommended this as a must visit. Perfect combination of down home feel, reasonable price and excellent quality mixed with neighborhood friendly service. Even though the shrimp and grits had an unfamiliar flavor combination, I still returned the next night to eat there again. Top five to visit.	1
Great place. I had a birthday dinner last week. The food and service was great. Friendly staff .. Very pleased.	1
Fantastic! Service was great. Atmosphere was historic. Food was awesome. Hard to find any flaws.	1
Halfpenny's has been in this spot for FOREVER, and even with changes of ownership through the decades, the food and service remain consistent.\nGood food, good prices, friendly service.  The owner remembers my preferences, ALWAYS!   And remembers my name, as well as the names of other regulars.   Love this place!\nOne time a colleague was kind enough to get my lunch, but did not remember my preferences.  When my colleague mentioned my name, the owner told her how I like my sandwiches!\nThis is a very popular spot for fast breakfasts, good-value lunch specials, and ICE CREAM!  Love those mid-afternoon pick-me-up milk shakes.\nNot a coffee drinker, but this is a very popular coffee place, offering many different flavors.\nThe Mrs. recommends Halfpenny's.\n.	1
Good, honest food, at a fair price, made by cheerful folk. I've been going there for years, and am rarely disappointed.	1
"Yuck!  I was on my way to Johnny Burritos when I saw their sign of \""specials\"".  I stopped in and ordered the cream of potato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich.  Both were awful.  The soup had the consistency of milk, and not much flavor.  It's no where close to \""cream of\"" anything.   The cheese on the sandwich was so thin that I pried it open just to ensure myself that they hadn't only given me 2 pieces of plain bread.  I like to support small mom and pop businesses, so I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but it was so off-putting that I don't plan to ever return.  Next time, I'll keep walking to Johnny Burritos."	0
This is your typical Jersey Mike's sub shop and it's located smack dab in the middle of uptown.  Like most Jersey Mike's the ingredients are fresh and the subs are really good.\n\nOn Tuesday's you can get a regular sub, chips, and a drink for $5.99.  I must say that's a pretty good deal.  If you keep your receipt from Tues you can come back any day of the week and get the same deal again for $5.99.  If you're not lucky enough to get there on Tues then the subs for lunch can get a tad bit pricey.  A regular club sub, bag of chips, and drink will run about $10.  When you get into the $10 range for lunch uptown you start to have a lot of options at your dissposal.  So my advice is go on Tuesday if you can!	1
"I'm a stickler for places where they remember your face. (see my ED's Tavern review).\nAs soon as I enter... One of the 3 worker's in the back yells out :\n\"" #9- Club Supeme, \n# 13- the Original Italian\nor you gonna get the Chicken Philly?\n\nI LOVVVEEEEE IT!! (I like the faces of the patrons already there hearing them call out my fav's.. a la a bartender pouring a shot b4 u take your seat)\n\nWhen I'm a lil iffy.. I'll just tell em.... hey... SURPRISE ME!!\n\nI go here at least 1 a week. (coupon always).. The manager ALWAYS ask... what coupon do you have today...lmao\n\nThey are kinda pricey.. so... thats the reason for coupon!!\nI work uptown/downtown (what does that really mean.. Uptown vs Downtown) so I frequent alot of these places. \n\nGo and enjoy"	1
"I go here with coworkers very frequently, and not once have I walked out disappointed!  If you are tired of subway or just want a great sub (hot or cold) come here!  I love their club sub \""Mike's way\"", and their cheese steak hot sandwich.  They are equally fast as subway, but in my opinion much more tastier!  I will probably be back here very soon! Enjoy!"	1
I went here twice. Not because I loved it but because someone else paid. So again, not sure about how pricey this place is. I wouldn't suggest all the plates on the menu but I would definitely suggest that you don't miss the lamb shank. It is huge!!! Reminds me of something Barney Rubble might eat. Very caveman like. So delicious and falls right off the bone. Minimal fat. The steaks are also very good. Do not recommend the chicken and dumplins. Salty and not at all like what you would expect. \n\nAgain a pretty good wine list and their bar area had lots of TVs so you could watch the game and have a beer or wine. Large restaurant. Good for groups. Had a pretty good cheese plate. Definitely recommend.	1
Pros:\nGreat ambiance\nService was friendly and attentive\n\nCons:\nKettle one with soda - everyone knows that's soda water right??? not 7-up, gross.\nSalt, salt, salt....we ordered the halibut and the veal, but we couldn't tell the difference, all we could taste was salt.\n\nTwo salty entrees, two cocktails, two salads = $130...ouch no thanks.\n\nI have four more days in this beautiful city, let's see what else I can find...	0
I was last the the Mimosa Grill a few weeks ago while visiting Charlotte on business. It was pouring outside, so to was very nice to be out of the rain and be immediately greeted by the welcoming decor. We were quickly seated by our very pleasant host and our waitress briefed us on the specials for the evening. I asked for a recommendation on a cheese selection her choice of a local goat cheese was fabulous. For the entree I chose the New York Strip Pepper Steak and it was prepared perfectly. A glass of Beringer Reserve Cabernet went very well with the meal. I have been to the Mimosa Grill a few other times in the past and have always been pleased with the entire evening, and this was no exception.	1
"Let's just say I swore I would never go back here again.  After 5+ years a friend that \""loves\"" it talked me into it.  I got the Chicken pot pie special and I would say it looked like baby food.  It was a pur\u00e9e with half a bottle of pepper on it.  The side salad tasted very bitter and it would be safe to say I only ate 50% of my meal because it was hard to stomach any more of this food.  \n\nFor a better review talk to my friend because he loved his chicken sandwich.  Unfortunately it will have to be another 5 years before I try it.  NO VALUE."	0
Best thing about eating lunch here is the patio seating. Special soft shell crab over mixed green salad was disapponting at best. Soft shell crab was over-battered and lacked crab flavor. Salad was dull and lime vingrette seemed to be missing the lime. Chopped red onion totally overpowered. On prior visits, sweet potatoe fries are decent.	0
"I was in town for two days and our hotel recommended this place, calling it \""updated Southern.\"" We were a little disappointed when we walked in, because it looked corporate and impersonal - everything that we didn't want. \n\nBut then I saw the menu.  There were so many really interesting looking things on it that I wish I was with a bigger group so there could have been more ordering and sharing. I ended up starting with a goat cheese, beet and orange salad. With those ingredients, you can't really go wrong, and they didn't. \n\nFor dinner, I had scallops that were encrusted with bacon crumbs on top of a pumpkin bread crustini. Really amazing flavors between the bacon, scallops and the pumpkin. My colleague also really enjoyed his pecan encrusted trout. \n\nBottom line: boring corporate setting, the opposite of boring food."	1
I can always appreciate a restaurant that has local and organic ingredients. Hilarious especially when you see such a place in the Southeast. You go Char-Char.\n\nMy family of 4 + friend of my sister = 5 came into Mimosa on a Saturday night. Um, why were we the only ones in the restaurant? I'm confused.... Charlotte you aren't that subruban are you? This is UPTOWN??\n\nRegardless, the service was perfect and the food was brought out promptly.  I thought that my meal was tasty and that it was cooked to my liking.\n\nI have also been here for lunch and had the opportunity to sit outside which was nice because it is a great location for people watching.	1
Took clients to dinner on a week night on what appeared to be a slow time. We were placed into a very crowded part of the restaurant. (empty tables elsewhere) Waiter was fair at best and he seemed in a hurry through out the meal. Food was nothing more than average which was a surprise after the high rating I read about. Unfortunately, this was not just my opinion but the opinion of all 6 people in our party. I was ready to write it off to a just a bad night when a colleague mentioned that his lunch the previous day was similar. The entire experience was certainly below my expectations.	0
Read reviews and beg to differ. Had to argue with staff that a martini does not only have two ounces! The glass was literally less than half full. For 11 dollars a glass! Rob was the bartender.When we complained twice, the glass got filed. Corn bread was like cardboard. Mussels very good. Trout very good. No doubt they have a good chef. However, the management is very lacking. Manager came over right when ewe we got our entrees and we asked her to come back and she never did. The bussing was a joke. We had to put our appetizer plates on the next table because they  were never cleared. Not a pleasant meal.Not worth the money.	0
I brought some out of town guests here hoping to impress them with an uptown dinner.  We left hungry and disappointed.  The food tasted ok, but nothing remarkable.  Portions were small and priced at least triple what you would pay for the same quality of food outside of uptown.  Service was friendly, but slow.  I don't think I'll give this place another chance.	0
Amazing!  While we were sitting at the bar waiting for our table the gave us two complimentary appetizers.  Food was great, the drinks even better, but the STAFF was the best part.  A+ all the way from this foodie!!  Ask for Alexandra L!  Best waitress/bartender on the block :)	1
i'm from california and did extensive research on food in the downtown area, even though i was only going to be here for a day. this place got good reviews, so i snuck in for happy hour before heading to the king's kitchen for dinner. basically, the only drinks on happy hour menu were a madras for $5 and miller lite for $3. um, not so cool. then i ordered the popcorn shrimp for an app. it looked delish when it came out. i even ate a couple and the sauces were yummy. even the people aitting next to me commented on how yummy it looked. then i saw a line of poop in one of the shrimp. a super gross out peeve of mine. i started to go through all the shrimp and they all had the poop. serving un-de-veined shrimp at such a fancy place?? uck!! i stopped eating. and left. will not return. BUT service was good.	0
It's a local treasure that may be overlooked in the city of Charlotte. However, make no mistake about it, the Mimosa Grille is a rise above the typical local city purveyor of fusion cuisine. While my experience was derived from Restraunt week have to say that had the bill been full price I would have been glad to have paid the normally expected total for this culinary delight. Beyond the meal, my server was attentive, knowledgeable and courteous to my requests and expectations. My only qualm would be that the hostess was aloof and unconcerned. A common issue overlooked by even the most establishments. If I could offer any advice to the manager is that a hostess is the am ambassador to your production. It's the first person I see and the last person to say goodbye. Please take consideration to the significance to this persons affect on every customers experience and is exreamly important in creating a premier dinning experience.	1
I went here for a business lunch the other day, and as a petite woman, even I was shocked at how small the portions were.  I typically need a to go box whenever I go out to eat, but here I finished my entire meal (trout and potatoes) and was still hungry.  We all ended up ordering dessert and laughed when we saw it.  The $7 cheesecake could fit on a tablespoon!  The service was pretty good in the beginning, but as the place filled up our server seemed to disappear.  He never returned to refill our glasses or bring the missing ice cream that was supposed to go with my dessert!  While the restaurant interior is lovely and the location is great for all those that work in uptown, the price you pay for the small amount of food makes it not worth it.	0
I came here on a Saturday night and had a really good time.  Our service was fast, friendly, and it was overall a great experience.  The short ribs were unbelievably tender, and I also enjoyed 'the tower' appetizer.  Some of the best non-traditional hushpuppies I've ever had!	1
Sounded better than it was. the Waygu burger is all hype and not that flavorful. Waitress was friendly and wanted to make sure I left full, but it was not the foodie experience I was looking for. Maybe I should have got the trout special!	0
My wife and I loved our food and the service.  It was a great date night!	1
Just tried Mimosa Grill for Sunday brunch. The buffet selection included eggs, sausage, and French toast; plus lunch items like macaroni and cheese and salmon.\n\nThe service was excellent even though we were at the end of brunch- water glasses were kept full and clean silverware was brought.\n\nI enjoyed our view of Uptown.\n\nOnly quirk- when we were brought clean silverware for dessert, our napkins were placed on the back of our chair. I didn't realize this.\n\nOverall, food, service, and mimosas were excellent; I look forward to returning for dinner.	1
Went for dinner with my wife on a Saturday night June 23rd.   This was our first time eating here.  We started out with some drinks and those lovely hot buttermilk biscuts with strawberry butter.  We had the Carolina crabcakes which were excellent.  My wife had the shrimp and grits and I had the pressed chicken.  Both were very very good hats off to the chef.  The atmosphere was so relaxing and the service was great.  We will definitely go back to try some more of the dishes!!!	1
Getting seated wasn't difficult but after that the experience fell apart. We ordered  cocktails and water. The cocktails came in a timely manner but we only received one water. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and I ordered the grilled scallops with butternut squash. The temperature of both dishes was cool. Almost room temperature. My husbands shrimp and grits were colder than my squash. The service was not professional. Being rushed to get the credit card out after receiving the bill.	0
I looked at the reviews and thought this would be a great place for bunch.  Wrong! I don't know how their regular menu food is but their brunch was horrible with a capital H.  $21 a person was way too much for disgusting food.	0
Very overrated, in my opinion. I'm assuming it's getting high marks because of the focus on some low-country food. Atmosphere is not that unique, elevator music. Food is fine, if not spectacular. Service was innattentive, not-very-knowledgeable. Alot of better options uptown.	0
I have attended a few events for my college at the Mimosa Grill. It's a great and elegant place to have a group event. The food is amazing and service has always been great. \n\nRecently I went to their BBQ event. It was all you can eat for $24. I went to see a musician play who is amazing. The crowd was very engaged and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Although I didn't try the BBQ I also had a great time. $2 beer specials and live music on a beautiful Sat evening. Cant get much better than that.	1
Absolutely fabulous. Our waiter, Adam, was great. The food was great. I'd go back here in a heartbeat.\nThe heirloom tomato salad may be the best thing i've ever eaten.	1
I heard from a couple of people that the fish and chips Friday special was something I needed to try and they were not wrong. Thankfully we were able to order our special around 12:50pm because by 1pm, they were all sold out. \n\nThe service was great and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.	1
Mimosa Grill, when you find it behind the vibrant inner city party scene of Charlotte is one of my favorite New Southern Cuisine spots with impeccable service, creatively presented fresh seafood and a yuppy vibe that feels good.	1
I loved the interior and its very relaxing after a long day. The menu has a lot of variety, all great dishes but a little pricey. The mussels were incredible! A series of appetizers and great company made it a great night. It can be busy so make sure you have your reservation and get there a little earlier. You can take a walk around uptown after dinner to work off the wonderful dinner.	1
First of all, the decor is very nice, and the service is great.  But none of that is any good if the food isn't up to par!  And, the food is NOT up to par.  \n\nI ordered the Rock House Farm Artisan Pork, which turned out to be teeny slices of unseasoned chewy pork loin layered with collard greens, some mac and cheese, a cube of fried pork belly with a greasy dab of something they call Arkansas black apple sauce. The collard greens were great, and the mac and cheese were great, but the rest was not worth eating.  All for $27.  Folks, pork loin is not expensive, and should always be tender and bountiful.  And don't give me a cube of fried pork belly and call it braised smokey bacon.  The Arkansas black apple sauce makes me never want to go to Arkansas.\n\nThe two stars are based on the nice decor and excellent service.  But the food was not so great.	0
Went here for dinner last weekend Saturday. The food was great the service was great. Would love to go there Again and try everything on the menu.	1
"Being a vegetarian it's always a challenge to find something more than salad n such on a menu. The chefs here did a \""creative\"" platter with a medley of different seasonal and local veggies that were amazing. The pea pur\u00e9e was super tasty as was everything they put together. Awesome biscuits n honey butter too."	1
"I went here for Sunday brunch trusting all the good yelp reviews.  However, I was extremely disappointed.  All the food was cold and clearly had sat around for a long time.  The servers were not friendly.  I politely asked that they bring out some hotter food and I was told \""we are working on it\"" and the employee turned away.  Some \""hotter\"" food came out 20 minutes later but most everything was still cold.  I called back later in the day because for $40 I expected better.  The manager disregarded my feedback, did not follow up, and clearly did not care.  My advice? Stay away unless you have extra money for cold food and bad service."	0
Wow this place was pretty great. Came here for a work function so we had the back patio to ourselves which was amazing, because it overlooked a beautiful courtyard. We got to sample a lot of the appetizers and everything was so exquisitely prepared. Truly a delight.	1
Checked this place out on a weekday for lunch. Was pretty busy but we were seated right away. \n\nGreat selection of dishes on the menu. Was hard to decide what to order. Decided on turkey sandwich.. Very good, large portions, had leftovers for dinner. The $2 up charge for Parmesan truffle fries is worth it!	1
Went expecting spectacular. Had been for lunch and had a great experience. Went for queens feast tonight. Got lobster Mac and that was good, but never had Mac and cheese with cilantro. Then got the scallops, she said it was a smaller dinner, but it was a total of 3. That's right 3 for $30. And one was undercooked. My stomach hasn't been right since I ate it. Which they assured me was not undercooked. Figured they couldn't mess up Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.... But it was room temp and runny. Oh well. Won't be back for dinner.	0
I wasn't quite as impressed with this place as everyone else seems to be. I ordered a chocolate martini which looked and tasted like a first time bartender made, not to mention, the glass wasn't close to being full. I had the lobster Mac and Cheese. I only found a few tiny pieces of lobster, one with some shell still on it. The Mac and Cheese wasn't anything special either. Our drinks and entrees took so long we asked for our checks as soon as the food came out, then had to physically track down a manager to take our pricey checks. Maybe they were understaffed or having an off night, but I won't be back.	0
A beautiful location in uptown Charlotte. Get the Sunday brunch. Awesome! $3 mimosas on Sunday, even MORE awesome, and the bartender even allowed me to sub cranberry juice for the orange juice. Oh yeah, the buffet is really good too. Cheese, fruit, bagels, biscuits, muffins, eggs, gravy, grits lox, chilled shrimp, salmon, halibut, steak, and more and more!\nIts not cheap but for the sheer amount of options available it is certainly worth it.	1
I only stopped in to get a night cap (dessert), so I may not be the best to write a review. However, I am docking a star because there was only one bar tender working, so it took him forever to address me, run my card, etc - and this was just for a slice of pecan pie. \n\nWith that said, the restaurant was nice - good location and great ambience. My pecan pie was delicious as well - it came with an ice cream that tasted of bourbon. Very nice pairing. \n\nI got there as happy hour was finishing up, but it seemed like it was the place to be for local finance execs.	1
Just ok food and service is not the greatest.  It took a long time to seat us for lunch, and it took even longer to order and get our food.  Their chicken sandwich was ordinary and the fries came out a little cold.  I think you would be better off grabbing lunch from Chicfila.	0
Had my birthday dinner here with a group of 13 and it was great! Service was prompt, portion sizes are ridiculously big and the food was tasty. \n\nStarted out with the lobster mac and cheese (delish), some ordered salads and my mom ordered the sausage flatbread (delish). Soooo, the chef sent out my mom's flatbread and 5 minutes later the waitress comes back with another one, a bigger one! Compliments of the chef bc he thought the first one wasn't big enough (looked big & good to me lol). Now that's customer service. \n\nEntrees varied and all were pretty good! Hubs wasn't a big fan of the short rib entree. The potatoes that came with my trout was pretty sweet like maple. Overall,  everything else was pretty good, especially the appetizers and small plates! Great atmosphere, great food and great service! Will definitely return! Thanks for a great birthday dinner Mimosa Grill!	1
Surprisingly quite (except for our table) on the Friday before the ACC championship game. \nI would imagine this place would be hopping after work! The atmosphere was great for the young crowd to hang out. \nMost had the filet, I had the lamb, and one other the salmon. All were cooked to perfection except the lamb. It was a bad cut with lots of gristle that I couldn't even cut through, so three sizable pieces couldn't be eaten. \nThe Tiramisu Chocolate Martini was with the whole trip to Charlotte!!!  We may have ordered a few extra of those.	1
Great experience.  The menu has a great selection, even for my pescatarian diet.  The Trout is their signature dish, which has been on the menu for 20 years.  It was amazing and came with a huge portion of fish.  Their signature appetizer, the hushpuppies, are also filling.  Go here with an appetite!  Great place for a family/business dinner.	1
Excellent service! The majority of their products are locally bought and the prices are reasonable for the quality. Some of the wines are arranged where a certain amount of the proceeds are directed to a local food bank. The lobster mac-n-cheese is an amazing start to your meal, especially when it's cold out. Definitely recommend the lamb or the pork on a bed of southern smoked greens.	1
I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!	1
I enjoy this club, because it is probably one of the fanciest strip clubs in Charlotte.  You will have to pay quite a bit of money here to get entertained.  I came here for Amateur night, because a good friend of mine was going to be in the competition.  She was both nervous and excited, but she did a great job.  That must be a huge rush to get in front of that many people and perform.  She actually ended up winning seven-hundred dollars, so the night unfolded into a pretty grand party.  I never visited VIP, but I heard that it is nice here as well.	1
Anyone who knows me knows that I'm not one for strip clubs. However, if more were like my night here, than I might change my mind.\n\nNo pressure, relaxed atmosphere, in a very nice looking (and clean) venue!\n\nBest part of the night? A 400 lb. (at least) man being brought on stage by a bunch of dancers and they slowly took all his clothes off down to his underwear. Probably the best night of that guys life next to his wedding (he was the bachelor).\n\nThe guy was a real champ! It made for an awesome show!	1
I and girl friend went here.... Lack if girls , no ladies rest room, pricy dances ... I am not recommending this shit to any one...	0
Worst strip club I've ever been to. Do NOT even think you could use coupons or think the manager will honor anything. Received a complementary free pass and was denied by the manager even though there was no restrictions. Worst service ever	0
"This place is a craphole. My friends and I have gone for a 2 AM breakfast a couple of times (I know that seems weird but it's cheaper than eating at the diner that caters the breakfast!) and the people working there are absolute dicks. The girl at the front door acts like she's the hottest thing since sliced bread. The girls that walk around are bit*hes unless you're throwing wads of money out. I jokingly told one of the girls that my friend wanted a lap dance and within 5 minutes he came back really mad. He said she danced and he handed her $30 and she said \""NO! It's $60!\""  That's crazy considering the girls don't even look very good! Maybe I'm biased because I'm not a strip club kind of guy but this place is a bad way to end a good night"	0
This is the most expensive club in Charlotte, but the best quality girls. The girls here are above average to awesome in looks. There are very few tattoos here if any. There can be a long line on weekends and after  sporting events.\n\nThe girls are not really friendly here but they ask you if you want a dance before sitting at your table. They won't spend time with you here if you aren't willing to spend lots of money. These aren't the fun type girls... they are obviously there for one thing and that's to drain your pockets. When you stop spending money they are off to another table. \n\nFYI: No smoking in any bar or restaurant anywhere in North Carolina. If they have a drink special it has to last all day... no happy hours. Sorry but it's NC law.	0
Even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad. I've eaten here and at the one in South End and both are a waste.  I usually just eat at the Pita Pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendors(the chicken on a stick is might damn good!) by The Forum.	0
This was the first good pizza place to open in Uptown.  It was a welcome addition to the noon time choices.  I am giving it four stars for that reason alone.	1
I am torn on this late night pizza joint. Great pizza, but absolutely the worst service I have experienced in a long time. Not only was the staff unable to correctly do their job, but they were rude to the customers and to each other. A supervisor ran around the restaurant screaming at customers about last call acting as if his paying customers were nuisances. His staff behind the counter talked about him and the customers while cursing as if no one could hear. After a staff member screwed up my order, she screamed at me that I was to blame and she was too busy to help and it wasn't her problem. Her supervisor did not help the situation. \n\nNeedless to say, I am happy that I do not frequent Charlotte enough to be tempted by their great pizza as I refuse to give them another one of my hard earned dollars due to their awful service. Suggestions: Clean up your unprofessional and rude staff!!	0
The two stars are for one thing.. The SLICE.  It is a descent piece of pie that would only be completely wonderful at 3am after a long night of drinking.  Other than that, this place is grimy, creepy, and nasty.  I would suggest trying one of the other Fuels outside of the city.. Trust me.  \n\n-Ian M.	0
We were looking for a pizza place downtown open late and stumbled upon Fuel. Even at 1:30 a.m., the place was packed, albeit with inebriated post-clubbers speaking at the same volume they did on the dance floor. The pizza was good and the prices were reasonable - we loved the little garlic bread balls. I didn't find the place dirty - the only thing that pained the eyes were the horrible ensembles worn by the patrons. Cocktail dresses should NOT be worn with flip-flops, ladies, and disco ball-inspired clothing IS as ridiculous as it sounds.	1
Awful!!!! If i could give it no stars I would!!!! Awful!!!! Way way way over priced for bad/ok pizza... over $12.00 for 3 slices who do they think they are...? There food is Ok at best! I live and work uptown I will never go back and will warn friends to stay away!!!! AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!	0
I guess their pizza taste great if you're drunk. Slices are so bland and bad. Nothing special here. Overpriced as well. Villa Francesca has much better slices. Check them out instead.	0
Aaaaaa-hole employees give the worst service you'll ever have. Unless you're blackout go elsewhere. They wouldn't give me a water for a dollar. $1.08. Ate the pizza dry as shit. Never again. Pizza was good though.	0
Second delivery second problem.  My girlfriend ordered wings and I took the order.....no wings.  \nWhen we called, she was informed that we did get the wings.  Evidently, they are invisible wings!!!\nPizza was mediocre BTW	0
"Ordered at ORDER HERE sign. She sends me to the cashier. Cashier asks me to repeat my order to him. I give him an \""are you serious\"" look. What a bunch of idiots."	0
Fuel pizza is usually decent. Good drunk food. \n\nTonight I visited the College St. Location sober and was pretty impressed with the quality of pie and quality of service. No over the top non-sense. Just thorough delivery of solid pizza. \n\nIt was around 9:50- didn't catch names. But Goldberg looking fellow that brought out pizza and desserts was hauling ass. He deserves a beer or 8.	1
Nice, upscale italian restaurant. Beautiful decor, great service and great food. The wait staff is very educated and can help you with selections, wine pairings and anything you need. The food is wonderful. \n\nLuce is not inexpensive but is well worth every cent. Located at the base of the Hearst tower so parking there is easy and it's a central uptown location. \n\nWorth a visit if you're looking for upscale dining with authentic italian dishes.	1
My friends and I went to Luce this past Saturday night.  It was my first time and I was very impressed.  Initially, I was worried about the atmosphere--IMO, the decor is a little stuffy.   But the staff is very friendly and the mood very relaxed.  The food is delicious and very reasonably priced (average entree is $20-25).  Check out their menu on their website: www.luceristorante.net .	1
Great restaurant! As a vegetarian, there were no no-dairy options. I had to  ask for them to make special accommodations, which the gladly obliged. The atmosphere was wonderful, a very classy place, even a coat check! No smoking and no line to get in. Very wonderful place.	1
We went there for restaurant week. The place is very cozy. Drinks are at least $8 a pop. The hostess was really accommodating and friendly. Unfortunately the food was far from impressive. They brought bread and bean which is yummy but there were not enough for eight of us. I'm not sure why you would bring 5 slices of bread on a table of 8 (we must look like those Atkins diet people). The crab/salmon patty was overcook. The risotto was good. The dinner (some kind of fish) was salty. To make matter worse... I found a long blond hair in my fish. The waiter comp my meal out. The manager never come out and talk to us (I think he's too busy tasting the wines). In conclusion... yea... we're not coming back.	0
The decor is really nice and the food is amazing. After traveling Italy for four months I would still say that the gnocchi here is incredible! The only thing I didn't like was the lack of attention to the bathroom floors, the amount of dust collecting was disgusting. Everything else was great including the amazing white bean appetizer with olive oil and fresh bread.	1
We love it and the veal sage ravioli is amazing. The Osso Buco to die for. This is not a place you go everyday but they own a lot of other places here in Charlotte. So you can get the same qaulity and a little less pricey. Osteria Coco in front is the and I believe meaa luna too.Really good Northern Italian Food	1
Went here on business trip for dinner. It was very good, fancy ritzy interior. The service is very helpful & friendly. The food is delicious. Everything was really fresh and made with care. \n\nHad the Salmone [Pistachio Crusted Salmon] and it was delicious. Cooked perfectly, great flavors. The fennel orange risotto was so good, unique taste. We also tried the sweet potato gnocchi. They were amazing. They were slightly crispy on the outside, sweet and savory. Also the white bean salad/dip that is put out with the bread is amazing. I would love to indulge by eating here again.	1
Soooo upset!  Went to Luce a week ago, and was informed they no longer do their $12.95 lunch special!  Still great food and service, although now I will not be able to frequent as often due to the harder hit to the wallet :(	1
My husband and I went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Loved the place the moment we stepped in. Great ambiance. \n\nOur night started off with a Riesling wine. While waiting for the order, we were provided with fresh bread with white bean olive oil dip. It tasted too good that we finished off the bread.\nOrdered Bruschetta for appetizer, Chicken Marsala and Gnocchi. Great meal. Our waiters were great. Were gentle and had fresh Italian accent that added to the romantic part of the dinner! \nWhen we were prepared to order dessert, they surprised us by bringing a chocolate cake with candle on top.. That was amazing!!!	1
Ate there for the first time this evening. Everything from the service to the food was excellent. Will definitely be going back!	1
Authentic upscale Italian cuisine, in classic upscale Mediterranean ambiance.	1
A great twist on classic Italian.  This restaurant is always a good choice.  They are regularly changing up their menu and offering different dishes that combine classic Italian cuisine with a unique take.  The osabosuca is always a good choice along with their risotto.  Portions are plentiful and the staff is more than welcoming.  A great spot for a quick lunch or a long dinner.  Prices are moderate, but you'll get your money's worth!	1
I eat there last week on a recommendation from a fellow employee.   I was by myself so I decided to eat at the bar.   The ambiance is very nice, the lighting is pleasant and the noise level is reasonable for carrying on a conversation.   Good section of wine.  I was pleased with the calamari appetizer.   The special fish course for the evening was sea bass over roasted sliced potatoes.    What I got was well presented but not sea bass.  It was gray, mealy, oily and tasteless.  Sea carp?  To add to the experience the potatoes were under done.  Very disappointing.   I'm curious about the Italian dishes but not interested enough to go back and try Luce again.	0
I loved the ambiance. Well decorated and fancy white table cloth. \n\nI ordered the veal, but wasn't that impressed with the lunch prices. I would try other options next time for sure.	0
I can't think of anything due to my food coma but it was all five stars!  The blackberry sorbet was a perfect finish.	1
Beautiful decor, friendly service, and delicious food. The portions are not large, but the flavors are to die for! The owner even came and introduced himself the first time we were there. We have been multiple times now, and never a bad experience.	1
"This restaurant really does deserve the awards that adorn their walls!! My partner & I had a truly \""spiritual\"" food experience here. The menu is full of mouth-watering authentic Italian dishes....that please the palate & leaves you wanting MORE.\nWe will visit Charlotte NC again & again just to eat at this restaurant..."	1
Wonderful authentic Italian and great overall dining experience. Courses arrive in precise timing, great wine selection, very attentive and high class service, classy and intimate decor. Cannellini beans tossed with tomato, basil, red onion, tomato, and olive oil are a delicious light start to your meal. The calamari is very fresh and the lightly battered zucchini mandolin sticks that go with it are a great complement, and the two sauces are excellent. My wife had the sea bass on special and it was fresh and cooked perfectly. I had meat sauce based pasta and it was great. The pasta was cooked perfectly, a sign of a stellar chef. All in all, everything was exceptional.\n\nEasily, this is some of the best food in Charlotte.	1
The best thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere. My husband and I went here during restaurant week & left feeling disappointed. Our waiter was not very attentive. The bread they bring out is good but the bean topping to go with it was overpowered with onions. We both got the seafood salad as an appetizer and it was just ok. Nothing spectacular. We both also had the lamb as an entree. It was cooked perfectly to medium & was very tender but it lacked seasoning. It would have been wonderful with some seasoning. For dessert I had the panna cotta. It was not impressive. The presentation was nice but it had no flavor. My husband had the chocolate cake which tasted like a frozen cake you get from the supermarket. The manager insisted it is made fresh in house but I'm not sure if I believe that. Overall we were very disappointed, especially with the good reviews we had read. We will not go back.	0
Fun place to go drink a few beers, but the food was really funny. We ordered nachos and got Tostito's and a cup of processed cheese goo. The sandwiches were ok, but uninspired...standard bread or hoagie rolls with meat and cheese. \n\nI'd eat there again if I needed a laugh.	0
"As a dive bar this might work... as a restaurant it is a total loss. The food is far below pub grub standards and their audacity to claim \""The Best Burger in Charlotte\"" is simply ridiculous. The service and food quality are non-existent. This place only exists because of its prime downtown location."	0
Great little place to grab lunch.  Beer specials, reasonably priced.\n\nBurgers are awesome!  Wayyy better than the 5 guys at epicenter, and their fries are pretty good too.\n\nThe bad reviews seem to be out of date, this place has new ownership and is pretty damn good.	1
This was stop #4 on our night uptown/downtown.  I paid $8 for small plastic cups of John Daly which is ridiculous.  However, my friend bought a blue Panthers shot, and they gave me a free one because they said I had to drink one too which was nice. It was all right, but I could have spent the entire night at BlackFinn instead!	0
"Love Phil's for a nice lunch. For us men, they \""entice\"" you with very attractive female servers, especially in the summer months. Hey it is what it is. BUT, all that honestly wouldn't keep them afloat if their food wasn't good, and it is! It's a DELI, not gourmet restaurant, so keep that in mind when going.\n\nGood burgers, deli sandwiches and a few healthier options like grilled chicken, etc. \n\nNot too hard on the wallet either.\n\nA solid lunch choice."	1
Stayed here while in town visiting family.  The accomodations are nice and the price is right.  Has a great location right in uptown Charlotte.  The place will also accept pets which is a big thumbs up in my book!  I ate breakfast in the hotel every day - it has the typical assortment of breakfast food and it was ok.	1
Lots of adjectives come to mind. Dumpy. Ancient. Moldy. Quite far from the heart of downtown (by Charlotte standards). Most rooms don't even have a minibar. Nor do they have nice TVs.\n\nThe wifi speed was decent though. That's always a plus.	0
The location was fine and the room had recently been updated to be very(almost excessively) modern. However, the reasonable price for the room was offset by the additional costs of the amenities. Internet access was $10 for every 24 hours. Parking was $13. Breakfast (mediocre food) was $15. Room service food was overpriced. Left feeling like it was NOT a good deal at all.	0
"We were here for New Years, for 2 nights.  And, It appears the \""Occupy\"" movement has got tired of tents and have moved into the Double Tree hotel.  It seems we were the only people on our floor without dreads and pot.   Many of these people were hanging out in front of the hotel, sitting on the steps,  for most of the days and evening too.  When I asked what was going on to the desk staff, they said... \""Sir, it's New Years\"".  Hmmm?  \n\nThe sheets have been used too many times and they need to get new ones.  Also, our room came well equipped with two unique blood stains, on the down comforter and wall in bathroom.     Happy New Year to us."	0
Nice hotel and good location.  The room was nice and the breakfast buffet was good but didn't include made to order omelets.  I would stay here again.	1
Beautiful hotel, lovely sunny room decor. Very comfy beds. Super clean! Nice amenities. Close to everything. Staff helpful. No free wifi, come on! Quiet. Great view from our high room. Great deal for my Johnson & Wales student. Loved our stay here!	1
Okay, I'm basing the low review on one factor--they charge for wi fi in the room.  I can't stand this new ploy some hotel chains are using to squeeze another ten dollars out of you (after the normal 3 or 4 special taxes they hit you with).  The hotel was fine otherwise but as you can tell charging for wifi is my pet peeve.  I will look for a more hospitable hotel next time I'm in Charlotte.	0
Stayed here in Decmber, 2012. Great hotel. Nice warm cookies at check-in, or if you just ask for one. Try and stay here anytime I'm in Charlotte.	1
Great first impression.  Lobby looks very clean and nice, staff are friendly, the hallway on the 8th floor is bright, clean and feels cool, not warm and muggy like some hotels.  \n\nThe rooms are very nice and contemporary, with nice clean corners.  The bathroom is clean, one of the best I've seen.\n\nThe AC has a motion sensor which is annoying, I was able to get the staff to bypass it and I was able to get the temperature down to 60.  Which feels very pleasant.\n\nGot my warm cookie, breakfast coupons and free Internet for being a diamond member.\n\nI never tried breakfast, even though I had free breakfast coupons I was simply too lazy to wake up early enough to try it.\n\nThe gym was nice, they had free weights, 2 treadmill (one was broken) and 2 elliptical machines.\n\nParking was in a parking structure that requires your hotel card or pay as you go.\n\nI would recommend this hotel.	1
2 stars for the curtious staff.  Rooms do not have fridges or microwaves....they can be provided at a charge if $10 (each) per day.  Decent fitness facility, with good running trails (frazier park) nearby.	0
Pros:                            Cons:\nAwesome staff.            14$ breakfast\nClean rooms.                No fridge\n                                      No microwave\n                                      No coffee	0
The food CAN be pretty good here, but it can be downright awful, too. The service CAN be pretty good here, but it can be downright awful, too (especially at lunch time, when you think the staff would notice businessmen and women needing to eat and go). But most of the time this place just falls flat.\n\nAnd do yourself a favor: if you ever read the restaurant health inspections online, DON'T read the one for Hartigan's (nothing awful, but you have to wonder why they had a black mold problem in the ice machine for so long!)	0
Cozy and welcoming.  This is my impression upon entering Hartigan's.  The menu features typical pub favorites, such as nachos, wraps ad burgers.  I chose the veggie burger without the bun and, dare I admit this?  Tater tots!  Ok, Ms. Healthy likes to splurge, too!  The burger arrived with tomato and lettuce, and there must have been a whole bag of tots on my plate because I couldn't finish them.  Friendly and helpful servers, too.  The only thing that I did not care for was the bar's playlist of current, top forty music.	1
"The bartender downstairs was extremely rude. I guess if you don't \""look\"" gay, you don't receive service. So much for southern hospitality. I will not be returning."	0
I know I am from out of town, but there is no greeting at the door or system for new customers. It looks like a good place to eat and hang out, after you establish yourself.	0
Strange little place hidden on 5th St. in uptown that for some reason stays packed. Of course, it's not really hard to pack this place, as small as it is. It does seem to be popular though, probably mainly due to the scenery of the bartenders. \n\nUnfortunately, you only get a glimpse of them as you grab a drink and try to stay out of the crush. And good luck getting back to your group or your table without spilling half of your drink, if you are lucky enough to find a place to sit.\n\nLive bands and, more often, DJs are in there spinning some decent tunes, but Phil's is more often a staging point for the rest of the evening, a springboard to bigger places and better things.	0
"A few weeks ago, a few friends and myself rolled in here to check this place out.  I walked up to the bar and immediately ordered a bottled beer, which cost about 4 bucks which I thought was a little steep. \n\nI then proceeded to glance around the bar and almost immediately realized that we had made a poor decision. I'm no xenophobe, but a cursory glance of the bar area led me to believe that I was in the middle of a UN convention in uptown Charlotte.  I have no problems with \""gays and gangbangers\"" as reviewer Jason L referenced, but it is definitely not my crowd.\n\nThe bar is undersized, old, dirty, and generally an undesirable place to congregate.  \n\nOther reviews have commented on the attractiveness of the bartenders and I will not deny that, but if your sole reason for going to a bar is for the attractive women that work there, then I recommend going over to the establishment on E. Morehead St.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back to this place."	0
You may end up here on Sat night if all the other area bars are busy.\n\nI'm not going to come down too hard on this place because it wasn't my choice to come here. One of the locals led a group of guys here initially just to have 'one shot'. He lives in the Avenue and knows the bar owner and several of the staff.  We got quick and efficient service at a great price\nand ended up staying for a few rounds of beers after a round of shots.\n\nThis place is rough, watch your back, There is a lot of drama and the kind of place where testosterone mixed with alcohol can make for a volatile mix.	0
Rudest bartender I've ever had	0
I'm from Chicago suburbs, so I'm used to townie dive bars and this place is great! The service was great! Richard, the manager was fantastic and made us feel at home. They were playing the Hawks game on the tvs and any bar playing the Hawks is a bar of mine! You HAVE to try the virtual bowling game! So much fun!!	1
Not the place to be. Crowd was dull . Music was ok	0
This place is terrible , never go here ever. It was 5 people in there I ordered some wings and the bar wench forgot about me. It took an hour to get my mediocre wings.	0
So we have had an ant in our drink, watched bartenders touch people's food and a bouncer refused to kick out a guy who showed His junk to girls. Classiest place ever.	0
I was really excited to checkout Brixx.  I had heard some great things about it.  We hit the 6th Street location.  My friends arrived before me and had their beers for 20 minutes.  10 minutes after I arrived, the waiter finally brought me a glass of water, then he flew off before we could order anything.  25 MINUTES later, we finally got his attention to request the bill. We had reached the point of frustration where we were so angry that we didn't want to order anything or give them our business.  The fastest part of the afternoon was when he brought the bill, waited and closed us out.  He did not receive a tip.  I have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant in my entire life.	0
It's slipped. I was a huge Brixx fan back in the day but it's just not up to par now. Bruschetta was stale over-toasted bread with marinated tomatoes. Salad was somewhat wilted greens drenched in dressing. Interior deserves a renovation. I hope they make it, but just think customers expect more, especially now.	0
Definitely a fan of Brixx.  I haven't had a bad pizza in here yet - and it doesn't seem like I will.  One of the perks of being downtown is going to Brixx for lunch... but definitely a great dinner place as well.  It's located underneath 7th street station parking deck so there is always plenty of parking.\n\nHaven't really gone here to drink, but they have a good selection of beers to go alone with your pizza.  Looks like the place has a full bar as well.\n\nThere is outdoor seating for when it is warmer and the wait staff are pretty friendly.\n\nWhen I was here last Saturday, they were having trivia - which looked fun.  May try it sometime.	1
Average to mediocre pizza.  I had a beer and the Bronx Bomber and never tasted a pizza this salty before.  And if the oven is wood fired they are doing it a grave injustice with the dough they use for the crust. It was sort of pasty white and bland with absolutely no character to it.  I know it is my personal bias but I prefer a crust that has some big air bubbles and an oven hot enough to char it just a bit \n\nAll in all I was disappointed by the food.  The two stars are because of the good service.	0
Really. Good. Pizza.  Great variety of beer and wine.  If you are in downtown, and want a good meal, eat here.	1
I was here this past weekend for a charity event.  It was absolutely packed and the bartenders were working extra hard.  I mean literally breaking a sweat!    Despite it being very crowded, the restaurant stayed clean and cool!  \n\nWe ordered a Margarita pizza which was freaking delicious.  Every ingredient was fresh and tasty.  Even the mozzerella was fresh, not the shredded typical stuff.  I would definitely order this pizza again.  Although this time I did not order a salad, I have in the past ordered the Brixx Salad and it is also quite excellent.  \n\nThe price point is nice on the wallet.  Our pizza was $9.95 and can easily serve 2 people for dinner.  \n\nIn terms of atmosphere, it is more casual but in a classy, Italian way, not a sports bar type of way.  I will be going back for sure!	1
Buffalo chicken was excellent.	1
Another great experience at Brixx!  Dropped in here for dinner last night and for the first time I actually tried their wood fired chicken salad.  It was perfect! Balsamic dressing, chestnuts, and great grilled chicken really stood out along with the goat cheese.  They serve the salads in chilled bowls and that's my favorite presentation for a salad.  The contrast of the cool greens with the warm chicken was superb.\n\nService was great and we had several visits to our table to see how things were going.  Another great little surprise wall Bell's Two Hearted on draught here! SCORE!	1
The pizzas my husband and I ordered were mediocre.  They were pretty greasy and I had the impression they had been sitting around for a while and just heated up before they were brought out to us.  I think this place is overpriced for the quality of food they serve.  The waitstaff was attentive.  I don't think we'll return.	0
I was looking for a place to kill a few hours in Uptown, and Brixx fit the bill perfectly. They've got an awesome patio, delicious eats, and friendly service: what more could you need? \n\nI was the only person there for the majority of my stay, but they didn't seem to mind. The patio had plenty of space to spread out (I was toting luggage and a computer) and they checked up on me just the right amount of times. The garlic knots were decent, nothing mindblowing, and the salad I ordered was huge and flavorful. \n\nBrixx isn't doing anything super trendy or memorable, but what they do, they do well.	1
It was late & nothing was open. Or so it seemed. A staff member at my hotel recommended this place. I'm glad I came. I ordered the Americo, simple pepperoni, mushrooms (I added olives,) it was fresh & delicious. I didn't catch her name but a pretty blonde lady was taking care of everything, very nice & fast which I appreciated. I'd like to try other menu items if I'm still in town.	1
Meh...I don't get it. Brixx just didn't do it for me. \n\nA girlfriend and I stopped in Sunday afternoon. The place wasn't too busy and we were greeted with the good news that they offer $3 mimosas! \n\nThe mimosas were good. But that's where the good stops...unfortunately. \n\nYeah, the prices were reasonable but I just wasn't a fan of the food. And for me I'd rather pay more to get better tasting food. \n\nI ordered the Americo pizza which comes with pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. I didn't like the crust, or the sauce and it arrived lukewarm. Ugh. \n\nNo thank you Brixx...I'll stick to other pizza joints to satisfy my pizza needs.	0
To my dearest Dylan,\n\nI saw you from across the restaurant and I knew you were a five star kind of guy but little did I know I was about to get five star service! Most people are made up of 70% water, yours is sparking, like San Pellingrino. The good stuff. You are a true angel. Thank you for that side of caramel and the Caribbean Lemonade recommendation. Take all my money. Take everything Dylan. You already took my breath away. Dylan? More like Lady Killin'! Miss you already...\n\nSincerely, \nYour two humble patrons.	1
I might not have liked the wood fried Pizza. Loved the starters though but not all. Three cheese was good (liked only two of them) and the bread sticks. In general pizza was ok.	0
"I'd like to say it's a relative thing (I've had LOTS of really good and different types of pizza) but this was an ABSOLUTE thing - just really bad.  We had two pizzas - a classic (it was fine) and a new-age (Buffalo chicken).  The problems: crust had zero flavor, the ingredients covered MAYBE 30% of the surface and maybe that was a good thing because they too lacked any real flavor.\n\nAnd then there was the service - incredible slow with lots of excuses (sorry - the bar got really crazy....and there was nothing crazy about it).\n\nThe only thing good was the above par beer list which we were forced to wait FOREVER to get our beer.  Bizarre.\n\nDON\""T GO HERE!"	0
Jerk chicken pizza was excellent. Bomber was good but the fresh oregano over powered everything else. Great beer selection. Service was good.	1
Where to start ? The food is bad and overpriced,, I love pizza and will gladly pay extra for great pie butt. Brixx is not the case!	0
Brixx will have many different types of thin crust pizza's. \n\nThe flavors are different and varried but they have a huge selection for you to try out.\n\nI got the Bronx which was pretty awesome.\n\nI will have to stop by again and try there other items on the menu whichever looked and smelled great.	1
I stayed here one night while in town for a job interview.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable with different pillow selections (foam, feather, hard, soft).  I appreciate having the microwave and fridge in the room when I travel in case I don't feel like going out to eat again or I'm too tired to get out.  \n\nAlso, in the lobby there are pre-printed directions to local businesses.  I didn't take advantage but there is a bar in the lobby.  Internet access was free and there was a desk in the room.  Highway access is convenient and it is close enough to bars and restaurants.\n\nThe gym is adequate and the equipment is better than most hotels, including tv screen so bring ear plugs if you want to listen.  There were not weights though and the pool is too small for laps but there is an aquatic center just a few blocks away with both ($8 a visit for non-residents).  The treadmills are sufficient for running but Uptown is completely side-walked so if you prefer running outside its 'safe' from traffic at least.	1
One of the nicest experiences I've had when traveling. \n\nRoom was clean, large, ready when promised. Rate was much better than local Westin or other Hilton. \n\nStaff were all gracious, helpful, and kind. I was traveling alone and sometimes (in other hotels) not treated as well b/c of that. Had a govt rate suite and was treated like a VIP even though my rate was less. \n\nFree local shuttle was a bonus. Shuttle guy was friendly and prompt. \n\nBreakfast buffet (part of my room pkg) was good and plentiful. Staff there were also solicitous. \n\nYes, I did hear some sirens. Yes, the gym was very small and the indoor pool postage stamp sized. \n\nI also had an in-room jacuzzi and so I was relaxed and didn't even care!\n\nForgot a piece of jewelry. Housekeeping staff found it and front staff person (Elizabeth G) mailed it to me. Nice!!\n\nI recommend it overall and would happily stay if I return to Charlotte.	1
Okay, I came back, based on my previous experience.  This time, I stayed in a 6th floor room, overlooking the main road and right across from the NASCAR museum.  As noted by another reviewer, these rooms catch A LOT of street noise.  If you are a light sleeper, be sure to bring ear plugs, or ask for a quiet room facing the other direction.  My first stay here, I had a suite with a separate bedroom.  It was very quiet and nice for sleeping.	1
4 of 4 stars (Excellent, mid-priced hotel).\n\nCan't possibly qualify for five stars (only high-end places can).\n\nNewly remodeled and contemporary lobby.\n\nFairly small rooms.  Fantastically comfy Herman Miller chair.\n\nGood choice for downtown hotel when you don't plan to spend much time in your room.	1
My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 5/21-5/28/14 for the NASCAR races.  The hotel was very clean and the staff was very good.  The room was made up clean every day much to our satisfaction.  We ate breakfast here most days and the staff in the restaurant area were very prompt and friendly.  We stayed here because of the location across the street from the Nascar Hall of Fame and it's proximity to the downtown area.  We were also right across from the Speed Street street fair, very nice.  The close proximity to the highways worked out well as we made it a point to visit South Carolina as well as other areas of North Carolina.  I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Charlotte for business or pleasure.  The only ding, if I may, is the parking which is a little limited and there is a nominal daily fee.  There was one day that the hotel appeared to sell out and we had to park in the adjacent open lot.	1
Very nice room with views of downtown Charlotte.  Next door to the NASCAR Hall of Fame.  We had tickets to the Panther/Bear game, which is a hop skip jump from the stadium.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Staff is very nice and personable.  Parking is reasonable with easy access.  Free coffee/cookies in lobby.	1
I was in Charlotte for a class and stayed here. It was really nice, and the staff was great! I had never stayed alone in a hotel and got upset while eating in their restaurant and the wait staff took care of my meal! It was so nice! I can't say enough nice things about them! They made my trip better and made me feel so welcome! I'd definitely stay there again!	1
Nice hotel close to everything downtown.  Shuttle service (complimentary) can take you anywhere in the city (but not the airport).    They have a nice cook-to-order breakfast option for $10.95, and a decent drink/good menu for dinner.  \n\nRates are much more reasonable than hotels just a few blocks closer to the city center.\n\nHampton Inn is just across the parking ramp... Easy to get between the two buildings.	1
The Goat Wagon Grocery has nothing going for it except its location. I shop here because it's the closest convenience store to my apartment.\n\nNegative experience #1:\n\nThe store reeked of marijuana. Smoking's fine, whatever floats your boat, but air the place out. You can also attempt to not look completely stoned on the job.\n\nNegative experience #2:\n\nMy girlfriend walked here to get change for laundry. The younger gentleman attending the store (the one who smokes) initially refused, saying the store didn't give change. First off, this isn't true; the older attendant gave me change before. Second, we shop here all the time, and everyone who works here recognizes us, including him. She offered to buy something to get change and he again refused, this time insisting he do her a favor by opening the cash register anyway. He was never this much of a wishy-washy jerk when we shop together.	0
Went to the Capital Grille for dinner and ordered a Ribeye. I know it is a steak house, but I ordered the lobster mac n cheese and it was FABULOUS -- best I've ever had! The Ribeye was tasty, but pretty much your run-of-the-mill regular steak. I enjoyed it but wasn't overly impressed. I don't have any complaints and would definitely return here. Although it's a steak house, don't be afraid to stray and order other items, you won't be disappointed.	1
The epitome of a pompous corporate steakhouse.  Go there to show your friends, or tell yourself you can waste dining dollars, and for no other reason!  I guess it's the natural byproduct of an expense account banking town.	0
"I feel compelled to say that I agree with Vinh about Mindy W. There are too many people who write these food reviews trying to sound like they're a foodie, or at least knowledgeable about food, and then it turns out they only go out like four times a year!\n\nI like Capital Grille. I like it as much as Morton's. I like both better than Smith and Wollensky, Butcher and Singer, Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, and The Palm. I get my steaks medium rare. On rare occasion, such as when I order prime rib at S&W, I get it rare. This is the ONLY way to eat quality meat. USDA Prime meat (and Choice) is not going to kill you like the crap you get in supermarkets. Supermarket meat needs to be cooked well done because the supermarket butcher probably rarely washes his hands.\n\nI've tried the sliced filet mignon, the filet \""cooked to order\"", the lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail at Capital. The lobster bisque needed more lobster, but the bisque was quite good and not too strong. My filet entrees were awesome. It's amazing that they can make Choice cuts taste like Prime."	1
Sorry- just doesn't do it for me.  The steak is average and it's over run by BoA middle management.	0
This is one of the best places to get a top-notch meal. Their aged steaks are cooked and seasoned to perfection. It is extremely pricey, but the size of the meat and savory taste is well worth it. This place is great for special occasion and couples. A couple will easily spend $200.	1
"Fine dining and elegant decor without the pretentious attitude.  Great happy hour bar with the famous \""Paul\"" bartending since 2004'.  Ask for a Stoli Doli Pineapple Martini and you will not regret it.  The Porcini Delmonico Steak and Lobster Mac n Cheese rule!!"	1
My favorite steakhouse in Charlotte! Yes it's a chain, but not every Capital Grille gets 5 stars from me. For example, the one in Chicago is 4, mainly due to ambiance. The was the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Charlotte and continues to be a place to go for dinner or dessert after dinner somewhere else. For me, the best cheesecake in town. Great patio for outdoor seating. Great open bar with top notch service. This is a place to indulge for dinner and wine. Both menus are impressive. Open kitchen concept makes the feeling in the restaurant a little more lively.\n\nThe Delmonico steak is great as well as the filet. Depending on the size of the lobster tail that night, getting it as an appetizer is a sure way to make the bill skyrocket, but hey, we only live once!	1
Went to this restaurant for my girlfriends bday. they definitely exceeded my expectation. service was excellent. they ushered us to a booth with the table decorated. then they sat us down and put roses and 2 glasses of champagne for us. took a picture of us and put it on a card. i was taken back. now onto the food. \nWagyu Carpachio - awesome. thinly sliced and generous portions\nLobster Bisque - lots of lobster in the soup. not as creamy as most would have it. ++ for me\nShrimp Cocktail - got 5 shrimps. and they were big shrimps. very fresh and juicy.\nSesame crusted Ahi Tuna. if you dont like sushi, dont try it. difficult to cook. tasted a little bland to me IMO. \nPorterhouse_ excellent cut. nothing else needed on top of the steak. cooked perfectly. \n\nNight ended with a complimentary chocolate cake. awesome cake!. \nThank you Capital Grille!	1
I first found the Capital Grill when we visit Charlotte.  We now have one in Seattle.  I have frequented many 'steak' houses, and I find Capital Grill the BEST.	1
The ambiance is deliciously dark and a throwback to the grand old days of quality tablecloths and real silverware.\nThe service here was very sub-par.  Perhaps that was because I was dressed like an ignorant tourist that just wanted to be comfortable checking out the city---FYI--tourists have money to spend, too...\nI hate the fact that most upscale steak restaurants ignores the needs of patrons who want to watch their waistline.\nMy husband likes steak, BUT--- I want to eat healthy.  So, how about some healthy options, Capital?  \nI had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk. There entree-sized salad was fit for a mouse that had already eaten...I  left hungry! Ugh.\nPlus---my special order came out wrong and I had to (once again) watch my husband eat while I fantasized about how many carbs were in the napkin...\nOh, I won't be coming back.  There are too many other great places to spend my well-earned money on.	0
No matter where you are, you can always depend on a capital grille to be top notch in every aspect. Came here on a trip to Charlotte, and just like every other capital grille experience, it was pretty much perfect. \n\nI had a card for a free appetizer from a capital grille in Philly, so I was able to to use it at the Charlotte location for a free appetizer. I ordered the calamari and as always it was delicious. In addition to this they give you a plate full of freshly made potato chips that are delicious. Between both of these it made for a perfect happy hour along with their awesome rum selection.\n\nThe service at this location was extra good being that there was a hint of southern hospitality added to an already great service experience. The bartender was quick, attentive and kept the drink glass full after seeing I was getting low. Great experience and I look forward to visiting the next Cap Grille in a different city.	1
The Capital Grille in downtown Charlotte is an excellent restaurant with fine service, welcoming people, and great food. Just be ready to pay the piper when you leave!\n\nAmbiance: This place is a fine establishment, which you notice walking in. They greet you warmly, take your coat, and do the right things when you enter.\n\nThe restaurant was quite busy, and noisy as well. We were fortunate having a large group, so we were seated in a dining area where we could close a set of doors. This helped tremendously!\n\nWine choices are plentiful, they did a fine job with mixed drinks and everyone was pleased with the drinks.\n\nFood was also excellent. We had several appetizers and they were all good to excellent. I really enjoyed the Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes. Slightly crispy, and delicious.\n\nFor the main, I chose the 10 oz. filet, which came perfectly prepared. The pumpkin cheesecake for dessert was very nice, but a little too sweet I think.\n\nOverall, the meal for our group was excellent. The price for this meal was over our normal expectations, even for Charlotte. It was the only slight disappointment in our group's evening.	1
I had lunch at Capital Grill and was pleasantly surprised by the menu options that included fish and other non-meat items. The service was impeccable from the moment we stepped into the restaraunt. I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded but there was an ice storm brewing outside, which could have forced people to stay in. Even though I begrudgingly went to Cap Grill because my boyfriend wanted a steak, I enjoyed myself just as much as he did. I had the salmon salad, which our waiter recommended, and was delicious, and my boyfriend had the filet, which he has never been disappointed by at any Cap Gill. The service stands out at Cap Grill and, as long as you're in the mood for deliciously prepared but simple dishes, you won't be disappointed.	1
Went for friend's birthday, my first time. The service was amazing, they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing dining experience. They brought out a bread basket to start, I highly reccomend the bread with the carmelized onions on top. We both ordered the current special of Waygu burger and glass of wine for $25 (we chose the Silver Oak Cab) served with parm. truffle fries. Burger was juicy and very flavorful.. served on a perfectly toasted bun with an overeasy egg and soft butter lettuce. We got a side of their dijion mustard and it was a perfect compliment to the burger. No need for ketchup for the burger or fries for sure. Dessert was a flourless espresso chocolate cake (friend loved it, I dont 'do' coffee) and a 'not-NY style' (as the server put it) cheesecake with a brulee top served with fresh berries. The food and the service made dining here an 'experience'... the price point is on the higher side (IMO!) so if you would normally not spend that for dinner I would definately reccomend for a special occasion... it will be my go-to spot for birthdays for sure!	1
Took my husband here for his bday sometime in the beginning of November. I told then ahead of time that it was his birthday and the did really special things. It was expensive but he was happy the food was great and free v parking. Not bad at all would do it again. He says this place has the best steak. We even got a picture to take home.	1
Loved it again.  This is our second time eating here and it has been fabulous both times.  Really enjoyed it.  Service was awesome!	1
So far the best steakhouse, restaurant I'd ever eaten at. The friendliest service, treated me and my lady like kings and queens. They were extremely helpful with the menu, never rushed us. Our waitress, Michelle, great person, even suggested we share because the portions were huge. She was right, we shared the tenderloin and poched lobster and with an appitizer and desert in was more than enough. I can't wait to go back. A definite choice!	1
Again, I have to say this place is fantastic.\n\nI love the staff, the service, and of course the food. Calamari, Lobster, Crab, and yes, fries. All great. And the service is always just about enough. There are places where you'd rather they stop coming but here, they know when you need them.\n\nSo, I gave'hem a great review last time on their Exchange Room and Filet Mignon. Now, I must recommend that you eat out in the sun as well. Yes, they have tables in the shade as well.	1
For my money, there is no steakhouse as consistently outstanding as The Capital Grille. Whether I'm in Atlanta, D.C., or Charlotte, their steaks are always cooked to perfection, their service always world class, and their wine selection second-to-none.\n\nMy wife and I recently dined at the Charlotte location during the Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, and for the absurdly low price of $30 a person, each enjoyed a delicious 8-oz filet, two sides and a dessert. As luck would have it, our local Restaurant Week happened to coincide with the Capital Grille's Generous Pour event, so we each enjoyed glasses of four different red wines for just $25 each. When the bill finally arrived, we couldn't believe what an incredible deal we just had!\n\nI could go on about why The Capital Grille is far and away my favorite restaurant, but you'll have to experience it yourself to understand. There's no better place to celebrate a special occasion, take a client for a business lunch, or just enjoy a fantastic steak.	1
Recently enjoyed a great meal  while celebrating our wedding anniversary. The staff made our experience so memorable complete with photograph  of the happy occasion. The welcoming taste of hors d'oeuvres was  just right. Our entrees  cooked to an excellent temperature.  And the sampler plate of desserts with happy anniversary was such a nice touch.	1
This is one of my favorite restaurants. My husband and I frequented this place 1-2x a week and often ate at the bar. Ask for Paul the bartender-he is very competent, but also entertaining. He treated us very well, and always remembers your name. \n\nI am a fan of the food. It is quality. I especially like the lobster mac and cheese. Despite its priceness, it is worth it. I am from Boston, and have been to Maine many times, so you can't expect to get cheap lobster in Charlotte, NC. The steaks are good-to be expected, but I was surprised at how delicious the cheeseburger was. I am a big cheeseburger fanatic and the meat is very supple and quality. The added sauces you can dip or put on the burger are a huge bonus. \n\nThe capital grille is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.	1
Took the wife for a nice dinner at Capital Grille.  I love the confirmation email you get when making the reservation.  The place was a little busy and our table wasn't ready despite a reservation so we went to the bar.  Paul the bartender served us stoli doli's(sp?), their signature martini.  It was amazing.  We moved to our table and we split the calamari.  It was solid..not great...the peppers were a little much.\n\nFor dinner, I got filet Oscar and the wife had the salmon.  Both were cooked well.  We split a side.\n\nPluses - great service, great steak...minuses - waiting for table, calamari peppers, price...sides should not be double digits in price	1
I ate there last night with two friends for a can't-make-the-wedding-so I-want to-do-something-special for you dinner.  None of us were disappointed.  This was my third visit there and, like each time before, everything was superb.  The service was exemplary and the food...it continues to WOW.  My friends each had a steak.  I had the salmon.  We all felt that this was some of the best food we had ever eaten ANYWHERE.\n\nYes, the prices are insane.  But for a special occasion dinner, I can't think of a better place in Charlotte to go.	1
It's good. Had lobster soup first so later the sea bass didn't taste that great. But I had it packed and ate the rest in the next day, it was soooooooo good!	1
Thanksgiving day dinner plate was pretty good.  turkey was a bit dry but large enough portions for leftovers for sure which was nice.  side dishes were excellent as always.  had to ask for extra gravy, but came fairly quickly.  daughters mac n' cheese was a bit blander than expected but not a bad thing considering it was for a child at the end of the day.\n\nservice was good, but our server seemed to have to go on break or something for about 1/2 hour 2/3 of the way through our meal which was unexpected.  fill-in waiter was fine until our original guy came back, but the change up was something not expected or experienced before at an establishment of this caliber.\n\nthe pumpkin cheesecake special dessert was EXCELLENT!\n\nwhile convenient for sure, be prepared to wait awhile to get your car back from the complimentary valet service.  It was not busy when we asked for our car and it easily took 15-20 minutes.\n\noverall a nice Thanksgiving afternoon.	1
I admit it, I'm a fan if the Bobcats. They're beginning to put a more entertaining product on floor every night and tickets are not too expensive. The arena is nice and there's really not a bad seat in the house. With the light rail dropping you off right outside the arena and the Epicentre across the street, there's no reason not to go see a couple games per year. Go Bobcats!	1
I have to admit that the Bobcats are a very far distant second team for me behind the Celtics. However, I have been to quite a few NBA arenas and the atmosphere the bobcats provide is truly phenomenal. With the Bobcats and Time Warner arena you truly get a full entertainment experience on top of the NBA entertainment. The bobcats always have great bands, dancers and other entertainment during breaks. Unfortunately the Bobcats have never had that one star player that makes you want to go see a game just to watch him but I think they are doing there best to get to that level. At this point and over the years their play has been very mediocre. Naturally a part of it is the fans fault. If more fans would attend the game then revenue would go up and the Bobcats would then not only be able to afford a marquee player but also attract them as well. I give the bobcats four stars but they are honestly at this point 3.5 stars. If you rate the organization overall three stars simply would not give them enough credit.	1
We had awesome box seats complete with some tasty snacks and beverages. While I don't claim to know much about Basketball ...(or anything really), I was able to still have a  great time. They had plenty of entertainment including a really awesome competitive teen cheer leading routine, children's choir,  and great jazz band. \n\nThe venue itself is very nice- and we even got to see Michael Jordan!	1
Had an opportunity to be wined and dined (or beer and dined) by the Bobcats last night. I've been to a number of NBA arena's and while the team isn't doing so great, the arena really is top shelf.\n\nGreat sight lines (especially when you are courtside!), excellent customer service all around, and incredibly handy from a location perspective. You can readily get tix right now and the Bobcats office staff offers a plethora of promotions and discounts to get the community involved. \n\nOverall I give this an overwhelming thumbs-up! If you haven't been to a Bobcats game, you owe it to yourself to check it out soon!	1
The suite was sweet!  Thanks Yelp and bobcats.\n\nIt was nice being able to walk in the executive entrance right beside the players I was about to see.  We were then guided down to the floor for pre-game casual warm-ups, somewhat entertaining, but not really my thing.\n\nOff to the suite we went.  A little far from the court in my opinion, but very clean, comfy seats, and great snacks and beer.  Cheese balls in the Chex mix, wowzers!  Definitely a great way to entertain 50-100 people.\n\nI hadn't been to a game in a while and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the turnout.  5 stars for time warner arena, 4 for the bobcats.  A little more excitement in the game and a few more wins, and you'll have another fan.	1
Went a year ago and had a great time, this time game was great we had tickets in the founders sections with the meal. Staff was new did really have their act together also rushed people out at the end of the night even with people backed up at the exits	0
I'm giving 5 stars because I love Michael Jordan and Kemba Walker!!  Hopefully, you guys will start winning soon!  \n\nHappy 50th bday MJ!!  You're an inspiration 2 athletes everywhere!!!	1
Great buffalo chichen sandwich, and a great beer selection.  Attentive staff and sportsbar-meets-college bar ambience.	1
Thinking about Matthew Broderick perhaps?  Erase that thought; this bar didn't really remind me of my college experience at all either.  There were too many meatheads, pompous jocks that I don't miss leaving behind in my old high school days.  Don't get your undies in a wad, I have plenty of friends that play sports and I like competitive sports as much as the next guy, but a lot of these regulars are stereotypical steroid freaks.  \n\nI am getting myself in trouble here, it very well could have been some kind of football after game outing.  I managed to meet an older brother that was into the Pistons, this was the highlight of the evening.  Either way, I am not taking the chance again with this place.	0
It can get really crowded on game days, but it's a fun venue to hang out and watch games. Weeknights are better than weekends, when all of uptown is kind of a mess, but it's a safe spot for a good night out regardless of the crowd. Since they get so slammed, the servers are pretty competent at handling overwhelm. They've got pretty good drink specials every night, and the menu is diverse for a sports bar. The drunken cheddar dip is pretty exciting. \n\nIt's an easy walk from anywhere else uptown, so it's a good place to start or finish a night of moving from bar to bar. They serve food until late-night, so get your grease-intake to fight off tomorrow's hangover before cabbing it home.	1
Went here for the first time to watch my Tarheels get the crap kicked out of them by Duke.  Though the game was horrible, the bar was great!  Had a buffalo chicken wrap and quite a few Fat Tire drafts and I had a really great time.  The staff was attentive and helpful, the people were friendly and personable, and I was very pleased.  Will definitely be going back for the next big game!	1
Okay, it's a 2 star trending 3 stars in my mind. \n\nI went there before a Bobcats game with some friends. We were the only people in the entire place. It was kind of nice, but a little bizarre, as we'd expect atleast somebody else there, but to no avail, we were alone.\n\nThey have some good stuff going for them: Practically TV's for wallpaper, half price apps (yeah and it's better than that Applebee's garbage), a solid location, and a pretty large bar.\n\nJust wish they had more people going in and out, but hey, faster service for me.	0
If you are into happy hours and/or lunch specials at bars on random weekdays, this place is THE BOMB. Here's why:\n\nMonday: 2.25 bud lights 4 dollars Smirnoff \n4.99 lunch- double cheeseburger\n\nTuesday: 2 well liquors 2 dollar drafts, $1 TACOS\n\nWednesday: Trivia night, 2.25 bud lights, 2 wells\n4.99 lunch- pepperoni pizza\n\nThursday: lady nights, $4 sangrias\n4.99 lunch- buffalo chicken sandwich\n\nFriday: 22oz beer price of pint\n4.99 lunch- 1-topping pizza\n\nLunch: 11AM-4PM\nHappy Hour: 4-8PM, appetizers are HALF OFF.\n\nThis place is a win if you go on the right day. The food isn't phenomenal, but it's definitely worth the $. Eat on!	1
"Ugh! The worst food ever. Who serves a shrimp taco with cheese? There was no mention of cheese on the menu for the meal. The \""Manager\"" was unwilling to comp my meal...they took a measly $3 off. The waitress asked what \""side\"" i wanted and i chose a salad...we were charged for the side when my meal \""came with a side\"". Plus they didn't have the correct vodka for a drink listed on their drink list and they charged us for the more expensive substitute! Hands down, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! Slow service (even though we were the ONLY customers in place). And let us not forget the worst restrooms ever. For a place with NO customers other than ourselves, the handicap stall was disgusting. Toilet clogged, the sinks haven't seen cleanser in quite some time. Don't waste your time or money!"	0
Disclosure: This review is based on St. Patrick's day bar crawl. So most places weren't on their A game for being slammed, but then again they still get one star even with that consideration.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nTables weren't being bussed, so we bussed\nMenus were sticky from spilled beer\nTook 15 minutes to order drinks then 15 more to get drinks and order food\nFood took 2+ hours\nAppetizers came with the food, not before, making the wait even more agonizing\nTater-tot nachos had very few chips and not much cheese, mostly iceberg lettuce\nBurgers apparently only cooked well done\nBurgers also come with toast in lieu of a real bun\nSeparate checks are too much work, so we split the table 8 ways\n\nI have to stop, the more I go the higher my blood pressure gets. It was really awful that day, I wish I had just gone to Five Guys and been done with it (I ended up going later). \n\nGet your shit together. Oh and I still tipped the waitress, most of that stuff was the kitchen. Should always tip cause they don't really get paid by the restaurant.	0
The Disturber is double the price it used to be yet now it take me half the time to read it. Not a good bang for the buck or should I say 2 bucks for Sundays paper. Sundays paper sometimes is no bigger than a big city's week day paper. Use to be you kicked back with Sundays paper and it would take several hours to read it all. Not any more, at least not from the Disturber. Plus other papers comic section is twice as big and they don't carry on Sunday some of the comics carried during the week. Guess I got spoiled by the Washington Post. Plus the Disturber is to Democrat and Liberal for me anyway.	0
It's always iffy regarding the daily delivery of the paper.  The circulation and delivery staff are inept and incompetent.  When you try to speak with staff regarding this problem, the publisher hides behind a Philippines phone service who lie to you that a supervisor will call you back.  That never happens.  I spoke to my delivery person who gave me the name and number of her supervisor in Charlotte, a Miss D.  The D must stand for Don't Deliver, Don't Call back and DUH, because I have left messages for her more than 10 times and NEVER received a call back.  The only time they call you is when they want money.  I am also told by my delivery person that because I live on the east side of town, the publisher doesn't really care about what we think or providing a decent service.  I am calling for the resignation or firing of the Circulation Manager who allows this third world behavior to happen.  The publisher, Ann Caulkins, thinks this is the Philippines and conducts business that way.  You're a local paper missy, deal with us as locals.	0
Just another liberal bias rag.   It's only redeeming use, is for lining bird cages and starting fires.	0
I've taken home delivery for over 30 years and the last year has a terrible one. I had at least 5 days with no delivery and at least 8 wet papers. I have a observer install paper box but it isn't used much instead they put paper in a thin plastic bag that will not keep water out and throw paper in my wet grass or driveway. In past it they would try to deliver a paper that day but not any longer,\nAlso I relized there deceptive pricing, I pay on a annual basis but I don't get a full years of papers as they cut back on your renewal date for some special papers where they add some insert and charge extra, even if you don't want.\nnewspapers don't help themsleves by doing this , this is why older subscrbers stop taking. I havn't yet stopped but if this keeps up I may	0
The last year of home delivery of this newspaper is the worst I have ever seen.  When you call to complain, you get someone in a foreign country who can do nothing to assist you with your issue.  I finally gave up and cancelled my subscription.  When I told the person on the phone I wanted to cancel it, she asked on what day.  Isn't that as simple as when my subscription expires?  \n\nGetting the paper at the convenience store is more reliable than the home delivery service of the Charlotte Observer.	0
Wow. Wonderful food and impeccable service. I will be coming back. \nFirst things first: kudzu butter, y'all. Kudzu butter. Amuse bouche of lamb bacon and Boursin cheese served on a crostini with cherry relish was a wonderful start. I went with the crab bisque and would pass on that next time. The ingredients used were obviously nice, but they were blended down to a frothy texture that wasn't appealing to me. My main course was the aged filet with the black garlic sauce. I decided to pair it with the grits and asparagus. Perfection. I've visited a nearby well known steakhouse recently and this was FAR better. The service was attentive, helpful and pleasant. I cannot wait to visit this place again. \n\nNote that this place does not offer takeout. The waitress mentioned they gets lots of calls.	1
This lovely restaurant near the BOA Headquarters and the business district is a surprisingly excellent restaurant in a hotel at the Marriott. The service was exquisite, friendly and fun. I was alone in the restaurant, and the server treated me incredibly well with conversation, tastings and suggestions. The shrimp and grits was my entree of choice and a house specialty. It was unlike any I've had in NOLA -- not barbqued, but roasted shrimp and scallops in a tomato butter sauce. The grits were so yummy and rich. The scallops were so large and tender that I could barely finish them. This is an excellent choice in downtown for a unique take on southern cuisine.	1
The worst service ever.\n\nI was staying in the Charlotte Marriott - where Savannah Red is located - for the Democratic Convention. I worked on events at both Conventions having come from Tampa where the Republicans held theirs. I'd been in the concierge lounge with a couple friends where I'd had 2 drinks. We made our way down to the restaurant and sat at the bar to grab something to eat before we set out on our evening. We were having a fun conversation and laughing and when we ordered,  I was told I was cut off from having more to drink. Not my two friends but just me. It was the most bizarre thing ever. Never, ever had that happen. I was not drunk or unruly and the waitress and the manager refused to listen to reason. I wouldn't go back here if it was the last place on earth to eat.	0
A hidden treasure hiding in plain sight!! if this wasn't located in the Marriott lobby people would be raving about  it. The creativity is only outdone by the delivery and flavor. Go if you want some of the best new south food, don't go if you are a snob who won't go to a restaurant in a  Marriott no matter how good it is!!	1
Truly. Meh. The Cutter's Cigar Bar is nice, so I had high expectations. Well, you know the rest of the story. I guess the idea was to let the hotel guests in shorts and colorful polos eat there because Charlotte has nothing better to offer? Not. Almost everywhere else in Charlotte center city is better.	0
A Charlotte secret and those who know about it, like it that way.  (hmmm, maybe I shouldn't write this review?)\nThis is a throw back cigar bar.  Period, end of story.  Amazing wine selection and bar.  This is your classic cocktail place with a staff that knows what that means.  \nSurprising thing is they have an incredible menu!  You would not suspect it, but man they got some talented chefs back there... somewhere.\nObviously, I am a fan.  Great for business meetings, just a cocktail or a complete and utter celebration.\nAnd really not smokey.	1
"Very cool place to relax and enjoy a good drink.  It wasn't too crowded the night I was there so we had the \""library\"" room to ourselves and the service was excellent."	1
I certainly enjoy a good cigar and one of the few places in Charlotte to light up this is one of my favorites.  The bartenders are great, they are friendly and provide first class service.  I will say that the cigar selection is a little disappointing but they don't mind if you bring your own.  As for prices, well like most cigar bars you will pay for the privilege to smoke indoors.	1
A very well managed cigar lounge.  One of the best I've seen.  The staff knows their stock very well. Decor is top notch. The food I had was above board and the atmosphere was incredible.  I will be going back for sure as I have more business in Charlotte...	1
Don't bother with this place. What a joke. We had a seat at the bar, no staff in sight. Waited about 15 - 20 minutes. Although two employees were milling about just around the corner, neither checked on the bar even once. Finally a waitress came out, brought a check to a table, walked behind the bar, fiddled with the dishwasher just a few feet away from us but never made eye contact. She proceeded to joke around with some customers at the other end of the bar, continuing to ignore us entirely. Fed up, we got up and left. \n\nBut wait, it gets better...moments later a different waitress came running out after us, asking if we'd paid for our tab. WTF???\n\nAvoid at all costs.	0
Must say that Bulleit Burbon is very hard to find and this place had it.  SCORE!! Dark leather, dark wood, great conversation areas, lots of cigar smoke and great service.  Didn't have to buy a cigar, the place was a blue-grey haze of smoke.   \n\nKind of wonky getting into the place.  It's not really in the hotel but it is.  You have to walk in the breezeway before the lobby.  Door is a bit unexpected, but not hidden.  Not their fault, but in a sense it adds to the ambiance.	1
I recently was putting together a city guide for some clients coming into town. They were staying right near the Epi Center so most of the bars and restaurants in the guide where there. \n\nHowever, this is one of the few bars that made it into the guide that was not. It is a great bar for business people visiting to relax and enjoy a nice cocktail and cigar. There are 2 pool tails and several couches to lounge in. The staff is always great.\n\nDown Sides: Drinks are fairly pricey and the bar is extremely dark. It's smokey which should be expected since this is a cigar bar.	1
Don't bother going. Walked in very excited to enjoy a cigar & watch the game. No TV's!  They said they didn't want to take away from their sports bar, which you can't smoke in. So I left. Horrible business model.	0
I suppose I am a bit unusual female as in I actually love Cigar Bars. They remind me of little speakeasy's in mob movies :)\n\nCutters is awesome. A little dim, leather sofa's, pool tables, well dressed clients. Attached to the marriot, they could have closer bathrooms. Ladies - remember anything you wear will probably need to go to the dry cleaners to get the smoky smell out -- even your coat!\n\nThe waitresses were a little slow, maybe they were understaffed, but it was a Friday night! They were very friendly though. \n\nThis is a great place for a date or a group that plays pool.	1
Not being a really big cigar guy, I do however enjoy one with a stiff drink every now and again.  I had the chance to try this place out and I have to say I was instantly impressed.  \n\nI think it was the decor really that did me in.  Leather chairs, sofas and love seats.  Comfortable bar stools and warm wood accents and tables.  Perfect interior for a nice relaxing time.  \n\nIn terms of food, drinks and cigars I would rank it as acceptable.  I wasn't really there long enough for food so I'll have to chime in on that at another time I suppose.  I do hope to come back some time soon.	1
Cigar bar at the Marriott. Way cool!. I didn't realize they were serving from their bar menu as well as from Savannah Red (great restaurant on property). I had the $8 crabcake appetizer. Lots of lump crabmeat. Definitely a nice bargain. Bartender Sam was very friendly and attentive. Nice crowd. Great cigars. Excellent choices of scotch and gin. My kind of place.	1
Cigar lounge that truly deserves the name. Don't get fooled by by Marriott location. Great staff, great location and music (incl. billiard). Prices are fair and food can be ordered from the restaurant just opposite. Selection of whiskeys is standard. \n\nCigar selection appear to be ok though I cant say for sure as I stick to Cubans (you can bring your own for a surcharge). Smoked a Monte Open Eagle, ate a great filet mignon and enjoyed local beer. Perfect early Saturday evening after a long oversea flight.\n\nTotally recommendable.	1
Great atmosphere, unfortunately no parking , like in most uptown. place is ideal for smokers , now that smoking has been prohibited everywhere, you can smoke inside by the bar or in the luxurious leather  chairs with a tasty beverage.  Con: Their bartender is a little snobby.	1
The cigar prices are marked up substantially, so bring your own sticks and pay the $5 cut fee. However, the service, decor, and bar selection are top notch! Waitresses and bartenders are super friendly and they mix great drinks. A great place to enjoy the finer things in life and converse with the fellas.  The class and ambience of Cutters are unmatched.	1
I think it's magic that this place can be in the middle of uptown and somehow, wildly, I've never been caught in game-day traffic. I was horrified to think of the quagmire it could have created, but even though Charlotte's roads have that bowl-of-spaghetti kind of organization, it's really never been that bad. \n\nI have been to a few Panthers games. I'm not a football fan...not at all...but the games are always fun here. I like walking around uptown in the vicinity before and after as well, as there are always a lot of interesting characters hanging out. \n\nThe food in the stadium is overpriced, just like the food in every stadium, but it's not shockingly overpriced. The crowd is always hype, and it's fun to go out and find a spot where Charlotte really comes together. We can be a kind of hodgepodge, soulless city, but you get a sense of who we are at the Panthers games.	1
For a football stadium BofA is pretty good. The layout is easy to get around- there's plenty of room to walk. Concessions are everywhere, and some are pretty good.  Find a JJR's BBQ Shack- the pulled pork is pretty good and the BBQ nachos may be the best stadium nachos ever.  \n\nIf you're in the upper levels, the stairs are steep. You can see the field from just about anywhere- even high up. Although with the Panthers playing, you'll probably have a better time enjoying the concessions and shopping. But if you do choose to watch, the seats are fairly comfortable. There's not a lot of leg room between rows of seats though, so climbing in and out of rows is a bit tricky.\n\nThis may not be the newest stadium out there, but it does the job. If you leave disappointed it won't be because of the stadium.	1
Haven't been to any other football stadium in the country, but BofA Stadium is nice.  There really isn't a bad seat in the house... I've pretty much been to a couple of games - and had the chance to sit in different areas of the stadium.  I think the best was when I got invited into a private box, but it's hard to get back outside after that.\n\nThe stadium also hosts college bowl games as well.... and I think a few concerts.\n\nSure all the newer NFL stadiums are great, but I think Bank of America Stadium is still pretty modern and growing in charm.  Not sure why people are wanting a new stadium since this one is already good - we'll have another Hornets/Bobcats scenario with our tax dollars hard at work.	1
With a new coach rolling into town and some great new players behind him, I was stoked to get a chance to see inside the 300 level Panther's Den here at our hometown stadium. With easy parking, this stadium has a lot of really great qualities, one of them being that it's in great shape (see: no one going to games because we stink). With the hopeful upswing of our Cats, I think that's a real plus for us and the taxpayers!\n\nThe Panther's Den itself and the VIP suites are beautiful. Spacious, with plenty of great views from around the stadium, Jeff G. (head of bev and food for 300 level) does a great job making sure everyone's needs are met. Liz who coordinates the special events is definitely in charge and runs a tight ship, making any event there go seamlessly. \n\nI'd definitely come back here, and check out a game in the seats, plus they're serving Olde Mecklenburg on the 100 and 500 levels, so you can pay $1 more for a great, Charlotte made craft beer!  go Panthers!	1
Home of the Panthers! WOOOO HOOOO!\n\nI really like this stadium, it's visually appealing & to me, no matter where I sit, I always have a good seat.  It's clean & the food selection is top notch.  \n\nParking in the area is plentiful & pretty reasonable on game days.	1
I love coming to Panther games.........LOVE it! Especially when I have lower level seats, but the upper level is not bad just lots of walking......not good with a toddler........that being said the pregame fire and cannon sounds scared the life out of my son...lol.......and then we got a little wet from all the rain but thankfully they have nice open air areas by concessions to sit and watch the game until the rain passed over. The food is usually pretty good, and the mini stores are sprinkled throughout if you want to buy any shirts, hat, etc.	1
We go hear often to cheer on the Panthers. The stadium is nice nothing special. Good selection of food that is reasonably priced. The restrooms are never far away and plenty of parking, at a hefty price though. The problem I have is if you want to stand up and cheer some wine and cheeser will yell at you to sit down. It happens every game. We are at a football game here people come on. If you want to sit down, watch it on your couch.	1
I very much enjoy stadium tours.  While I have been to more informative tours and more impressive stadiums, I had a very good time.  Also a not very expensive tour (only $5).	1
This was a great stadium.  I came here for The Brothers of the Sun Tour I loved it.  It sucked because it rained at the beginning but it stopped before Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney started to preform.  I think a great enhancement for the stadium would be to put a little roof over the top seats just so it shelters you a little.   Charlotte is an awesome city and the stadium is very nice.  Im not a panthers fan so I most likely won't be coming here for a football game though.	1
As a Panther's fan, and a neighbor of the stadium, I'm probably a little biased here, but I like this stadium a lot. My one and only qualm that I've noticed a few other reviewers mention is the flow of people into the stadium. It's always a cluster f#$%^k going in! They either need to minimize the pat-downs, or somehow open up a few more gates somewhere.  Other than that, the views from just about every seat are good, the food choices are good, if as usual, a little pricey.  If only the Panthers were a little better, I might have found it within myself to throw that 5th and final star on top!	1
Here for UC v Duke in the Belk Bowl. The acess is excellent and if you are willing to pay ~$30, you can park in close. \n\nThe have free wifi throughout the Stadium which was a first for me. Food and drink prices were not astronomical like most pro stadiums. The view from any seat is good and if you buy club level, you can watch from inside if the weather turns bad. \n\nGreat choice for a bowl game and hope UC returns again.	1
Well I never been to a professional football until now, it was great people was drunk but not out of hand , food and drinks expensive of course stadium look nice but then again I never to another stadium so can say I was a virgin.. Lol we were up high sec 540 row 32 but still saw the field so no biggey. I loved it. Next time I'll know how the seating  goes. U gotta see the stadium if ur in nc. You guys are great out in nc.	1
You know when owners and fans ask for a new stadium?  You know how it's usually the owner...and they want the city to chip in?  Bank of America Stadium could be on the poster for that exact scenario.\n\nWhat I don't get about the stadium is how it's really not that old...and it's just sad in general.  It's as if they picked this stadium out of a Sears catalog and plopped it in uptown.  As far as stadiums go...I'm not sure I've been to one with less personality.\n\nBank of America Stadium serves its purpose...but so does the Goodwill and Taco Bell...and I'll bet you don't do all your shopping and eating at those establishments.	0
I've been here plenty of times over the years for Panther games. I love it! Not a bad seat in the place. I've also brought family and friends from out of town by here even on non game days just to look around. The huge panthers on the exterior of the stadium are very impressive up close. If you're looking for authentic Panthers jerseys or other NFL team memorabilia, the team store, located in the stadium, is a great start. Looking forward to the next visit!	1
"There is not a bad seat in this house for a football game.  Seriously!  We had our backs against the wall in the \""nosebleeds\"" to see the Panthers vs Saints December 2013, and had a GREAT time with a wonderful view!  If you think it might rain, bring a poncho; if you think it'll be cold, bring a coat!  Employ common sense, and you'll have a blast!\n\nTHAT BEING SAID... the concession workers STINK on an alarming level.  By and large it takes almost a HALF HOUR to get a drink of ANY sort.  I stood in line for 20 minutes (ALL OF HALFTIME AND THEN SOME) for a diet pepsi... the workers are worse than slow... actually, city workers could give them some tips on efficiency... it's THAT bad if you're not in club-level seating.  My advice?  Eat before you arrive, arrive early, order your drinks, get cozy in your seats, and enjoy the game! :)"	1
The most traditional stadium in the NFL with great sight lines from every seat. The most fan and kid friendly stadium as well as the safest. Great food with Bojangles, Krispy Kreme and JJRs BBQ. Wifi from ATT. New video boards and a sound system for 2014. Watch multi camera replays on the Panthers mobile app using wifi.	1
How is it possible that I haven't reviewed BofA Stadium yet? This place is my second home during football season.\n\nI've sat pretty much everywhere in this place. I can honestly say there is not a bad seat to watch a game. \n\nThings to know: ladies, there are bag restrictions. Nothing bigger than a clutch will be allowed inside the stadium. You can use a big plastic bag. If you are not clear about any of this, head on over to the Panthers website and look over their policy on purses and bags.\n\nBofA Stadium does have wifi now. My phone seems to function better without it for some reason. I'll be curious to see how my new iphone 6 will work. \n\nLines move pretty quick for bathrooms, food and beer. Use your head, everyone will head out at halftime to do these things. Beat the crowd. Friendly reminder: beer sales stop after the third quarter. The concessions stands do take credit cards. The satellite beer tubs are cash only.\n\nWin or lose, this is my happy place. Go Panthers!! Rarrrrrrrrr	1
"Horrible experience with security staff during Georgia Tech vs. FSU game, the staff was incapable of understanding that students within the student section are going to sit with their friends and not random people. I saw countless groups get seperated and moved to their \""appropriate\"" seat when the staff had been explicitly told by organizers to allow students freedom of movement within the student sections. Thus, either there was poor communication during this event, of the situation was improperly handled."	0
Enjoyed being at the Bank of America Stadium but the usher in our section was a complete and total Ahole. We were sitting in section 513 in row 1A. As my buddy was walking up the steps, one of the teams ran a play, so my buddy stopped at the top of the steps so he wasn't blocking the vision of people in the seats as he went by. The Usher started screaming at him to sit down! No joke, not polite, or friendly just rude and a jerk. Then after my buddy sat down, the usher came over and started arguing with us. Really? I was completely floored by this guys behavior. Are theses the type of people you hire t be ambassadors to Charlotte? You might want to look a little longer for employees, or not hire toothless high school dropouts.	0
Had a few great experiences here. I did the stadium tour and the lady who gave it was great. Explained history of the team and facility. I also attended two games as well. I sat lower and upper levels and that's not a bad seat on the house. We'll be back for more games in the near future.	1
Bland franchise with a terrible uni color scheme and brutal logo. Other than the one season Jake Delhomme did not play like the mediocre QB he is, that's it. I defy anyone outside of Carolina to name a player on the Panthers. Julius Peppers does not count as he just left.\n\nI do love one thing; Coach Fox likes to call the onside kick at the most unlikely times and they often work.	0
great team,	1
I'm a little drawn here. As someone who lived in South Florida, I'm still a bit of a Dolphins fan. Yep, they've been doing pretty terrible lately and I've been here in Charlotte for a few years now, so maybe it's time to think about changing my loyalties to my home town team.\n\nAs Steve mentions, we don't really have the rivalry here that really drives fans. There isn't a Yankees/Mets or Yankees/Red Sox or even a Dolphins/Patriots thing going on. Maybe we need to start hating on those Atlanta Falcon sissy-boys?!\n\nYep, they're not that good lately. And I'll cheer for them. But when the Dolphins come to town, I'll be in my aqua and orange.	1
It was nice as usual, with one exception: they didn't allow ANY PURSES or bags unless they are clear, yet there were no signs or information warning about this until you got to the doors. A bit of a pisser for A LOT of people.	1
Are u kidding me $53 for a mediocre meal!!!!! That was nothing short of robbery. Dot get me wrong the interior design was great I just wish the food was good also!!!!!!!!!	0
"I enjoy Chicks if for no other reason than it still serves a chicken salad sandwich that is close to what chik fil a used to do before moving to that way too thick bread they now use. Chick's was started by a fella who used to work for chik fil a so the poultry offerings are pretty similar to what you find there. Fried sandwich, grilled sandwich, etc. Chick's has a greater variety on the menu though in terms of various salads, more side choices...  They also serve breakfast.  Service is friendly but it can sometimes be on the slow side when the line is long. Definitely on the \""grab lunch eat at my desk\"" rotation."	1
Just an update. I have been back many times. The Mac N Cheese is the way to go here. it's amazing! Definitely try this if you are in town for lunch.	1
"Tried Chicks for lunch a few weeks ago and was not impressed. The 2 staff working were very friendly, but the fried chicken sandwich is clearly just a frozen fried chicken patty brought back to \""life\"" in the deep fryer. It was alright for a quick lunch, but defintely not worth the 4 star yelp ratings that initially convinced me to try it out. I haven't been back since.\n\nI'm pretty sure my high school cafeteria serverd the same fried chicken patty sandwich..."	0
Connolly's is exactly what you think it is: an Irish-style pub. That's great. No frills, no bells and whistles, just an ol' fashioned place to meet friends and grab beers. I love it here. Because of its location in the middle of Uptown, it's a great place to meet after work or before, say, a Bobcats game or concert/event downtown. On most nights, it's pretty mellow here, so it's a great place to chat and drink, or even watch or discuss the game on TV. On weekends, though, and Thursday nights, it gets a lot more crowded--pretty packed, in fact, so it's definitely got a different feel on those nights. Great place to meet singles, as far as I can tell. \n\nThe bar itself has two floors, and the upstairs is usually more rockin' than the downstairs--more people, louder music, etc. There are a million beers on tap, as you'd expect, so you can grab pretty much anything you'd want, and obviously they've got all the liquors down pat, too. \n\nGreat bar. It is what it is.	1
My favorite Irish bar in Charlotte and probably the friendliest bartenders I've ever met.  I'm no beer connoisseur but apparently they have the best Guinness in Charlotte because of the short length of the line from the keg to the tap.  I've tried it and I can at least concur it is good!\n\nThe only take away for me was the lack of lighting in the place, last time I was in there it was very dark and only lit by candlelight.  No biggie, but when I'm having a beer after work with a buddy, I don't really need the romantic feel of candles....hahaha.\n\nIn short, if you want to grab a beer and be greeted by some of the friendliest bartenders in Charlotte stop in here sometime.  \n\nBTW, it does get pretty packed during the weekends and can get crowded.	1
"I've been to Connollys twice, and both times it was for a special event being held in the upstairs room. My most recent experience was for a \""Relentless Against Cancer\"" charity event that my friend was throwing in honor of the charity her family runs. Connollys management and staff were quite wonderful in allowing her to host the event upstairs, offering up great drink specials to help lure in the masses. The upstairs room is a decent size and would comfortably hold around 75 people. As there were around 50 when I was there, the room looked full but you could still get to the bar for a drink, which is always a good thing. There aren't many tables or chairs for seating, but plenty of space to mill about and chat with the other folks in the room. Outside of walking through the very busy bar area downstairs, I've not experienced the main masses at this Irish pub."	1
I know Guinness is the Irish staple but I assume they drink other beers too. The selection here is horrible. The service was friendly and the place seems to always have a crowd but I just cannot figure out why.	0
Just love this place. It is my go to bar for sure. The same staff has worked there forever, it seems, and they are more than happy to accommodate you. I told one of the bartenders a story once and went back weeks later and he had remembered me and that story. Good stuff. Nice to know they actually like their customers! Johnathan is super nice at the door as well. I think that maybe covert kicks in at 1030, but dont quote me on that.	1
Darkest bar in Charlotte! No need to clean up the place just keep the light down extremely low and no one will see the bar scum on the floors. II don't think its that dirty but seriously I don't really know for sure because they keep that place like a damn cave, even in the middle of the day! This Irish Pub is pretty cool though, two bars on two floors and an outdoor seating area partially covered so your covered for the summer time thunderstorms  on sunday funday. Corn hole is set up out on the patio which can help pick up your a portion of your tab if your competitive and into gambling. The bartenders were friendly and the mood is more laid back and chill than other bars downtown. Peak hours can get pretty packed but the off hours are good for kicking it and catching up with some old friends.	1
Alright! My little Irish pub! I just drink Guinness when I'm here. I'm part Irish myself so when I'm here it makes me want to go the motherland lol. There's an upstairs and a large patio with games and such. Hope to see you there!	1
So far I like it.	1
After dining over at the EpiCenter, a big group of hard-partying folks decided that we wanted to have a few more adult beverages before calling it a night.  We ended up walking over to Connolly's & taking over the upstairs room.  I think the majority of our group ended up staying until last call.  We had good service and they were very accommodating despite the fact that a few folks in our group were pretty loud and maybe bordering on the obnoxious side.  But, thankfully we were all staying across the street at the Omni so  no worries about safety as we were leaving (with the exception of one guy who needed a little help getting down the stairs, LOL).	1
TRASH. \n\nI can't tell you about the bartenders. But I can let you know the door man and some other bounces are not pleasant. \n\nI've been here a few times. It compares to Dandelion but about 10 times trashier with staff who don't really care about there customers.	0
Well finally a place that can pull a pint. Good atmosphere and a friendly crowd. They also had a good selection of Irish whiskey.	1
Yes.  Its just a bar.  But a bar with the best black and tans around.  I love this place.  Always dim and has a cool atmosphere.  Also, short walk to the Charlotte Hornets games!  Great place to meet friends and then go to a game.  I love this place!	1
I hate this place especially the bouncer justin who refused to let me enter the establishment because I was wearing a UK polo. He said he was a unc fan and couldn't let me in because I would start stuff. I tired to talk to the manager before he laid his hands on me and threw me into the street nearly getting hit by a mini van. I tried calling management to express my opinion of the psychopath they have working the front door but the number does not work anymore. Further more I will never return because of the people this place chooses to hire.	0
This to me is about the experience if you are with friends, otherwise it is small crowded areas and little air conditioning. Upstairs and outside areas are tight too.\nIt's really a 30ish looking crowd and most of the beer is mainstream, so they have cocktail specials most every night.\n It is loud and there's alot of staff around but it takes them a while to get to you, I did not notice anyone eating anything so it's bacically and drinking establishment.\nI'd bring my friends here on St. Patrick's day but it's not my fave.	0
Very crowded, food is just ok, bartenders are outstanding, great location, but here's my issue, why on earth do they charge a cover to go in? This is a drinking/eating establishment and they charge a cover when there is no band playing? Seems ridiculous and all about $$$$$$$$!	0
I was not very impressed with this place.  Walked in and immediately felt like I was working in a waste water treatment plant.  I cannot believe the employees can take the smell.  Had to go outside after getting a beer to make it work.  If they clean this place up, it would be pretty cool.  Good luck!	0
Worst experience I've ever had in my life at the Carolina place mall beware!!! The receptionists are very rude and one of them hung up on me before telling me that maybe she might get back to me? What kind of business are these people trying to run?	0
We had our child's first portrait session here for the growth panel- a series of photos from pre-sitting, sitting, and first steps.  We're just at the first leg and so far we're really happy. Excellent quality, personal attention,  and I love that this is a local family business, not a chain or corporation. I'll update this as we go along.\n\nPS they have really cool bookmarks available with your photo and you can have a name written in on it- it looks really sharp!	1
I have been going to Arthur's for years, since I worked at South Park.  The food has always been consistently good.  One of the best grilled cheese around, with bacon and tomato.  I was not disappointed today, with the grilled cheese.  Another good option is the hot turkey grinder.	1
The Arthur's menu offers a wide variety of options, including burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soup, salad, & grinders...plus wine desserts & other treats.\nA great spot found in Southpark Mall, to avoid the food court and maybe select something a little healthier.	1
Although Arthur's offers a good variety of options, the service and execution, and wait time has diminished the last few times I was there. I ordered a six inch turkey hoagie, with chips and a drink, $12.00, ugh! The sandwich was brought with no tomatoes and lettuce and they forgot to add the onions I requested. The bread was stale, and after waiting 20 minutes I was definitely disappointed.	0
The bagels here aren't as good as everyone said they would be. I actually think I like the Einstein's Bagel's bagel-cream cheese combo better. I personally prefer the plain bagel and cream cheese over the egg sandwiches because the eggs are kind of weird and microwavy tasting. The nice thing about this location is that it's on the 2nd floor of the epicenter and you can get there directly from the Aloft.\n\nThey have some very good deals on breakfast bagels that are CHEAPER than Smoothie King. Damn you delicious expensive smoothies!\n\nTip: I wasted $2 on a very very disgusting and watered down Iced Coffee. Avoid at all costs. Minus 1 star for that.	0
The other day, I had been itching for a bagel and hoped since they had Bagel in their name that they would actually have perfected the bagel. Well, not so much. \nThey lacked the variety of bagels and Cream cheeses I am used to seeing. No Tofu Cream Cheese? Wha? Usually, I can at least find a Whole Wheat Everything Bagel so that was lacking too. As, for the line I'm not sure what that was about cause I think I could've gotten a better bagel at Starbucks. Guessing it was some of the other lunch options.	0
Excellent service. Always a friendly smile. This is a location i frequent often. The staff and managment are always friendly, remember your name( and favorite drink) and generally make it an enjoyable stop during your day.	1
"If you're in a hurry, don't come here. They crawl at a snail's pace. VERY SLOW.  I've been standing in line for 15 min. Finally got to order and I tell the guy \""sausage and egg on a plain bagel, no cheese\"". \n\nYou'd think my order was so complex. He couldn't remember what I ordered. \n\nIf you're in a hurry don't come here."	0
Horrible. This used to be a great place to grab some great breakfast and coffee, and despite it always being busy, the lines moved very quick and efficient.  \n\nIt appears now they have an entire new crew including new managers.  Service quality and speed went way down.  I've tried coming back several times thinking the new staff will eventually improve, but each time, I wait longer and longer in much shorter lines, and a majority of the bagel baskets are frequently empty, leaving only 2 or three choices.\n\nIt's clear I'm not the only one who has given up coming here frequently; this used to be a fun hangout spot as well, but now the few people that come in just get there food to go, as it is always empty (yet service is still very slow)	0
Huge bar, cheap drinks, radio friendly songs you've heard a million times and they let anyone in.  That's both a blessing and a curse depending on how you look at it.	0
I'll agree that Buckhead is probably fun if you're wasted. Unfortunately, I've never been able to stand it long enough to get to that point in the night. I'm totally fine with bars that aren't fancy, but I do prefer places that don't have peanut shells on the floor and deer heads on the wall. Plus, as is the problem with many Uptown bars, the guys there tended to be jerks and the girls tended to be embarrassingly trashed. \n\nYou can, however, go on a Wednesday night and watch dozens of people vie for prizes in the cornhole tournament. That's pretty entertaining.	0
BlackFinn is like Buckhead Lite, if that makes sense. This place is literally like stepping into a good ol' boy frat house, maybe at Clemson or UNC. But as I've previously stated, this doesn't mean that the place isn't fun. It just means that you should know what you're getting yourself into when you head over there. Not a place to go for a casual drink, unless you're going midday or on a quieter night early in the week. \n\nLots of TVs in this huge bar, so it's a pretty decent place to watch a football or basketball game, especially since a lot of fans turn out here to check out their team. Located literally across the street from the Arena, it gets pretty packed before or after Bobcats games/concerts. It gets especially nuts on Friday and Saturdays, so be warned (or advised, if that's what you're looking to get into). \n\nThere's always a cover, which is a pain in the butt, but it's generally a good time if you're looking to really tie one on with friends.	0
Basically, I look at this place as having paid $7 to get groped by drunk ass bro's.\n\nAlso...do not wear open-toed shoes here.  The floors are atrocious...flooded with beer and piss and what-have-you and tainted with every communicable disease on the block.  That may be an exaggeration, but probably not.	0
"I am not an \""SF snob\"", but I have to agree with the previous two reviews by San Franciscans.  I travel often and am not native here, so I also have to say Charlotte doesn't understand good service at all.  Either I am left with an empty glass for way too long or I'm being badgered and made to feel rushed.  At Lavecchia's I've had both experiences.  Both times too, I was underwhelmed by the decor and seafood's taste and presentation.  I will not be going back again.  Oh, how I wish there was a good seafood restaurant here!"	0
This seems to be one of the many places in Charlotte where it comes highly recommended, impresses you on first entry into the restaurant with the decor, waters your palette at first sight of the menu, and then leaves you feeling very unsatisfied when the actual meal comes.  A beautifully presented restaurant, menu, and plate of food....but they seemingly forget that what brings people back is the actual preparation of the food and the ingredients used.  I had the calamari and tuna and both were poorly cooked, underseasoned, and the ingredients did not taste fresh or well selected.  Will not go back.  In Charlotte, you have a lot of bad imitations of fine restaurants.  This is another one.  For fine dining in Charlotte, I would stick with The Palm, Capital Grille, Ruth Chris, Morton's, etc....  If you are really craving seafood, I would go with Upstream instead.	0
Very swanky place, kind of reminds me of Blue Fin in Atlanta.  It has a very modern design to it with nice wood floors and metal sculptures of fish hanging from the ceiling.  It's all very impressive.\n\nThe food is to die for as well.  A great wine selection and food cooked to perfection.  The signature dish is the lobster, but I've always liked shrimp better.  It's a very nice experience to try.	1
Not a bad place but there are many others in Charlotte that are better. We where seated at a table so close to another couple that we might as well have eaten dinner with them. So if you are looking for atmosphere, not your place.  \n\nDon't get me wrong Lavecchia's isn't bad it just isn't up to par with some of the other nice spots in CLT.	0
I sat at the bar to try out Lavecchia's during Queen's Feast, Charlotte's Restaurant Week, fixed price 3-course menu. The atmosphere was nice & attentive. I didn't see the hostesses smiled once during the meal. Not sure what's up with that. I ordered the loster bisque, grilled Atlantic salmon & chocolate layer cake. The bisque was lukewarm at best. The salmon was tasty & the only redeeming part of the meal. The chocolate cake was cold & hard. If this place is deciding to dog it for what is supposed to be a showcase week for restaurants that's pathetic. If that's just how it is here then that's bad given their price points. Either way, I won't be coming back.	0
Enjoyable dinner place. I found some surprising entries on the wine list, including one of my favorite Regusci Cabernet Sauvignon 2006, The food was pretty good, very tasty filet mignon and cooked well.	1
I had what was probably the best tuna ever at LaVecchia's.  I ordered it medium rare and it came out perfect.  I couldn't get enough of the wasabi, and the rice complimented the tuna perfectly.  The atmosphere was nice and lively.  We also had wonderful service.  I'll be back!	1
I really enjoyed the food at this place however the service could use a little work. The oysters and mussels were excellent and the filet melts in your mouth. Having to wait a really long time for our server to bring a bottle of wine and take our order knocked this place down to 4 out of 5 stars.	1
The service was good but that's about it.  My tuna was cold and was not cooked well. The rice was the best part of the meal. Definitely not worth the prices. Steak was over cooked. Croutons were rock hard. Deserts tasted store bought. Atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale.	0
The food was pretty good, but the service was the worst I have experienced in a long time! \n\nWent here with a client for dinner on a week-night and had the most surly and unhelpful server ever.  We had a reservation, but were mostly ignored and both the hostess and server acted as if we were unwanted vagrants walking in off the streets. \n\nWe wanted to order a bottle of wine and asked for some suggestions... this was a waste of time because the server either knew nothing about wine or just didn't feel like being bothered.  Fortunately, we were able to find a decent wine on the menu without any help from the server. \n\nIt's truly a shame that I cannot support a local entrepreneur over a corporate chain, but honestly, I get much better service down at places like Capital Grill and McCormick & Schmicks... next time I have a client to impress, that's where I'll head instead of LaVecchias.\n\n :-(	0
We were ten minutes late for our reservation, but LaVecchia couldn't have been nicer about it! Sat us immediately at a great table, and we received adequate and unobtrusive attention throughout the meal. Mussels appetizer was simple and good, steak and salmon entrees were perfectly done. Water glasses sat empty a couple of times, but not enough to really spoil the experience. Overall, a nice evening out.	1
"Just nothing to write home about. I knew we were in trouble when we asked the waiter where the oysters were from and his response was \"" somewhere up north I think\"". The fried oyster rockerfeller were very good. We were pretty much the only ones in there. I might stop back for a drink and an app, but I would look elsewhere first."	0
"I went to LaVecchia's for the first time EVER just a few weeks ago. I had heard so-so reviews from friends so I was a bit skeptical at first but thought that the dinner was very nice! The entrees that my date and I ordered did take a little long because they were very busy but we just enjoyed our appetizer in the meantime so it didn't bother us at all. The manager even bought us a bottle of wine for us because we had waited \""so long\"". Score! The service was on-point and our waitress was incredibly friendly and helped us out with suggestions when ordering. I'll be back to LaVecchia's!"	1
Im sitting in Caribou right now as I write this review!!  I enjoy this much better than any Starbucks in the city.  Nice staff, leather chairs, and super fast wifi.  The coffee is good too.  Im not the biggest coffee connesieur but it tastes good.  \n\nIt is kinda hidden in the Bank of America Plaza so just keep on walking passed Sbarro and the other shops an	1
The service is great, the atmosphere good. \nThe coffee is bad, while the food...\n(Oh, the food...)\nThe food makes your waist\nExplode to the nines.\nCausing this Yelper\nTo write in bad rhymes!	0
I Asked for a Mount and Balance from them and had a good laugh.  I buy my tires from the Tire Rack(online) and Goodyear quoted me $154 dollars just to put the tires on!\n\nI'd Highly recommend Kirby & Kale in the Elizabeth Area. They did the same service for $40.	0
We took our car in for its yearly inspection. To our surprise, the car 'failed'. They quoted us $200 in repair work for a light - which seemed to be working just fine. We took the car down the street for a second opinion where the car passed with no issues.  \n\nThere's something suspicious about this place. I'm just sayin'...	0
DO NOT take your car here unless you want something messed up!!! Took my car in for an oil change and was told my brake fluids would need changing for an extra 75 bucks.  Saw the oil light on my car go off in a few weeks but took off getting it looked at for another few weeks.  Found a nice surpise later that the cap wasnt screwed on right from the last oil change and car had engine damage.  These guys are the WORST shop in Charlotte.	0
They scratched my car. A big one and my bad that I didn't notice it while picking up the car. What more I have to say?	0
Took my car in to get a quote on the brakes, my car is a 2011 with only 41,300 miles on it.  They wanted to replace all the pads and all the rotors, saying that the rotors were rusted and quoted me $660 for all four.  Took the car to the dealership who said only the rear brake pads needed to be replaced, I have at least a year left on the front pads.  They also said they could easily machine the rotors to remove the rust.\n\nTypical auto repair shop trying to steal money especially from young women.  DO NOT go to this shop.	0
Let me start by saying it's a bus station. Automatically means dim lighting, strange smells, and the dank air of dying souls. \nBut that aside, I felt safe here. It's a small station, but the bathrooms are fairly clean, and although I got there as the bus was pulling in, they got me checked in and on my way. Because who wants to spend any more time there than absolutely necessary? \nBut I do have a tip: if seats are at a premium (which they always are for late arrivers like me), always pick the black muslim guy with the kufi reading the Koran. They generally are the most courteous and least likely to try to feel you up if you fall asleep, which you must do when riding the Hound, for your own sanity.	0
a tip: if you need anything from this local charlotte station don't call.  they never -- as in never -- answer their phone.  you can't leave messages, you can't find a live person.  if you need a live body to talk to at the local station you have to go down to the station in person yourself.	0
Oh greyhound, how  you suck my soul ever so slowly like a dementor.\n\nAs bus stations go this one is pretty neat, tidy and clean. There aren't a lot of seating available so feel free to use your luggage as a couch as I was doing at one point.\n\nCustomer service here is pleasant and courteous. The only issue I ever have with greyhound is their lack of communication to the customers when there's a delay.\n\nLook, I get that I was travelling in the middle of a snow storm because the arctic decided that America was more fun to hang out with than the North Pole - I get delays happen. But what I don't get is why no one is forthcoming on what's going on in the stations.\n\nHowever I gave you 2 stars because the new buses are pretty swish. I do love the plug in charger options for phones and the free wifi. If only the free wifi worked more than it didn't.	0
This place is a cool place in Charlotte.  They have Salsa dancing on Thursdays that can get pretty busy.\n\nI usually come here midweek, but hear that  weekends are fun too.  The bald headed bartender was very friendly and knowledgable.  The IPA I had was really good (but just a tad warm).  I am staying at the Holiday Inn across the street so this is a good low-key find right next to my hotel.   Was described as a Bank Of America bar and not a Wachovia Bar, I guess the two of them compete in this town?!?!.........Kidding.  Have fun.	1
A lot of people (girls) I know love this place, but to me it seems like much of the same in Uptown Charlotte: it's crowded, loud, and a little over-the-top. Again, though, as I've always said: this isn't always a bad thing. \n\nOn Thursdays through Sundays, this place is pretty packed with twenty-somethings and maybe braver older adults looking to booze and get after it, probably before hitting a louder/dancier place nearby. There are plenty of food options (try their mini pizzas and other appetizers), so you can come here and grab a snick whilst you drink or before you head out to drink more. \n\nI've been told that their martinis (their selection and creativity is extensive) are awesome, so if you're into that you may wanna try them. And they usually have some great deals on those, so be sure to check that out.	0
I've always loved this bar and have gone since it opened.  Love Paul, the best bartender in the world. Once he waits on you, you pretty much never have to tell him your order again. Great apps!  But I must admit I haven't gone lately due to having to pay to park after 5pm.  Think its ridiculous.  Great people watching !	1
Been here several times. This place has it all...apps, tapas, salad, pizza, sandwiches, sushi and dinner entrees. Great for drink specials, especially martinis. Had the chicken pretzel sandwich which was good. Could have done without the tangy relish, but overall is was a good chicken sandwich. If you need a place for a private party, this place can host any size.	1
Ate at cosmos on a Thursday bogo on tapas ordered chicken quesadilla n needed more sour cream n was charged 50 cent! Ridiculous I will never patronize again. Also the food is just ok not the greatest they should b glad u stop in with all the other choices.	0
Yeeeeaah, I know it's, y'know, power lunch by day and disco by night, but wow was the dinner I had here underwhelming. \n\nLike, boring, oily, scant salad, meh fries, expensive, bland beer selection. Our waitress was gone - either invisible, dropping things loudly and whisking off like she hadn't just startled the beejeezus out of us, or just that warm mix of fed up/bored/seriously, you want something? kind of service that screams for a 5% tip.\n\nSomehow still managed to spend 20 bucks a head. And that'll be the last time I visit Cosmos.	0
Recently had lunch at Cosmos Cafe in uptown. I ordered the Steak Frites and wasn't asked how I'd like the steak cooked. It came prepared okay, but the meat was exceptionally gristly.\n\nFood and service alone would be a perfectly average 3-stars. However, we were seated next to some piece of wall art at a two-top. A large flying type of bug (flying ant, maybe?) made it's way onto our table twice, from underneath the wall art. I flicked it to the floor, and about two minutes later, another one emerged from behind the art, hovering next to our table. I could imagine the first one was a wayward insect that had flown in the restaurant, but when I saw a second one I began to suspect that there might be an infestation in the restaurant. I won't be dining at this Cosmos location again.	0
Met some friends for dinner/happy hour. Bogo tapas before 7pm was a draw. Ordered the Crostini and Crab con Queso...both were excellent. The burgers were great as well. This place has a cool, open atmosphere, however we were among the only ones in the restaurant at ~6pm on a Tuesday. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. Great place to meet up with friends...not too loud, not to crowded.	1
I have been to Cosmos' twice in my 18 years in North Carolina.  I must say the first time was a better experience.  I went during the CIAA the gratuity was 20%.  \nA grilled chicken sandwich cost me $11.00 (overpriced), the taste was substandard and no seasoning.  I guess you can say we recieved third quality food at high end prices. It was terrible.  The the service was okay and I was atmosphere was not that great.  I do not see myself returning.	0
"Not impressed.  Went for lunch with a group.  No one really bragged about their meal, especially me.  I told the waiter what I was debating between and he suggested the brisket saying it is good and \""very filling\"".  I ordered the brisket.  It came out about 5 minutes after the rest of my table was served and the piece I was served was well over half pure fat.  Due to the fact that half was inedible to me I was hungry again within 3 hours.  If I am ever in Charlotte again I will find another place to eat."	0
Definitely a fun place to go...but dress code is way too strict during night club time.  Apparently you have to have a collar shirt to get it...I've worn regular shirts (nice ones of course) many times and had no problem getting in.  Oh well, it's a private club so I can't argue it, but I'm still only giving them 2 stars.	0
I went to Cosmos once for lunch, and the Cajun chicken panini wasn't bad. I went back again for half off appetizers, and was horribly disappointed. We got the crab dip, which has no discernible pieces of crab meat and tasted as if the whole dip (including meat) had been pureed. We also got the stuffed mushrooms, which arrived shriveled and left too much to be desired.	0
I stopped in here for lunch. The food was just average and service was awful. They were very understaffed - it took about 10 minutes for the server to take my order, and then about another 40 minutes to get my food. I was in a bit of a rush, so ended up speed eating. \n\nI had a Greek salad, and it was just ok. Ingredients were fresh, but the chicken was pretty dry. \n\nNo bueno.	0
Very friendly staff, free wireless, and lots of seating make this a great uptown spot for a coffe break.  The atrium outside the shop is a great sunny spot to sit and read.	1
I love this Caribou location! As Krishan said the staff is very energetic and very happy to see you and you can't beat that. They have $1 Medium Drip Coffee on Mondays and as all Caribous do, have a trivia question o the day where you can get $.10 off your coffee. You can sit inside in one of their cozy seats and sip on your drink or walk out into Founders Hall and enjoy it there. If you sign up on their email list, you can get coupons and special offers on their coffee, teas, smoothies and packaged coffee. It's not really convenient to just drive to and get a beverage but if you work in the Uptown area it's quite convenient. There's usually a line in this place but it goes by quickly and I have no problem dealing with that for a nice, hot fresh cup of joe.	1
I was at the Aria in the same building for a lunch meeting - I ducked into Caribou for some caffeine before my meeting started. As I had only about 3 hours of sleep the night before at the Aloft Epicentre Hotel (due to a stupid nightclub next door playing loud music until 2:00 am on a Wednesday night) - I was really tired and dragging.\n\nThere were quite a few people in line ahead of me - but the two folks working the registers quickly whittled the line down. I ordered a triple shot iced latte with whole milk.\n\nDrink came up fast as was exactly what my brain cells needed! Strong, tasty, and delicious! Nice location in the Bank of America Corporate Center. And free Wifi!	1
Been coming to this place in mornings and on lunch breaks almost going on three years now and was quite happy to know that this location was not selected for closing, unlike the ones Park Road and East Boulevard. Coffee is excellent, all of the time. Staff are marvelous, friendly, and know people by name (as well as learn your orders and take them before paying, if you come often enough). The breakfast foods (i.e. oatmeal, biscuits) I've ordered on occasion and liked them. Keep up the great work Caribou.	1
The permanent exhibits at Discovery Place are fun for kids of all ages and the exhibitions are top notch as well.  I was fortunate enough to see the Dead Sea Scrolls there and will be going back to check out Body Worlds this month.  The IMAX screen/planetarium is an experience that shouldn't be missed, especially when they get the occasional first run movie in.\nThe only reason I rate Discovery Place a 4 out of 5 is that they discontinued the laser shows they used to hold years ago every Friday and Saturday nights.  Those were good clean fun for the college crowd.	1
I've been to Discovery Place during all three decades that I've been on this earth, and I love this place.\n\nI can recall many a school field trip here, where we usually just ran crazy instead of actually paying attention to the exhibits.\n\nPrevious reviewers are right however...Discovery Place isn't just for kids. \nRecent exhibits such as Body Worlds (which I unfortunately missed), Pompeii and the IMAX movies provide plenty of attraction for us big kids as well. \n\nParking is fairly convenient as well, which is a definite plus for something located uptown.	1
It seems that every school in the entire Mecklenburg district sends daily day-trips here; I swear there are ALWAYS buses parked outside with large groups of children pouring out, smiling happily to be away from school. With good reason, too: this place is pretty rad, to use the parlance of a youngster.\n\nIndeed, this place isn't just for young fellas. My girlfriend took in the Body Works exhibit here recently, and it was awesome. The exhibit itself was amazing, but it was presented in a really cool way--Discovery Place has great space. Moreover, this place is really clean and modern, so it's a great area to explore and walk around in. \n\nWe came on a Sunday and, shockingly, it wasn't that crowded, so you should be able to get in without too much trouble. On top of their specific exhibits (which are great for kids and adults), Discovery Place shows movies that are worth checking out--so do check them out. Great way to spend some free time on a weekend, definitely.	1
Took my almost three-year old here and while they had one great room full of activities(water, music, lights, blocks, construction , etc) that was it for her.  We spent an hour or so in the toddler-oriented room, then were disappointed by the rest of the exhibit.\n\nThis is much more oriented to older children, maybe 5 - 11ish who would benefit from some of the more mature exhibits upstairs.  While we did enjoy our time there, I felt that there weren't enough activities for young children.	0
This is really amazing if you can afford it.  It was $22 for my boy and me to go.  BUT he had an incredible time.  Couldn't get him to leave and we must go back.  It has tons of science demonstrations that are hands on and they demonstrate physics in a  way that is really fun.  They have several shows per day that teach about animals, let kids touch and feel aquatic life, there is an aquarium portion, a rainforest to explore.  The Cool Stuff area (physics stuff) is amazing!!!  Highly recommended. Bite the bullet and spend the whole day.	1
I am thrilled with all the renovations Discovery Place has done. You'd think this place is just a crazy science experiment for kids to come and explore. That's true on one hand, but the amount of fantastic exhibits they have to offer are fantastic. This visit was for the mummy exhibit. Guess what.. We went with no kids. All the kids there were polite and not annoying if that is something that bothers you.\n\nI am a creature of being able to see history. As usual, they blew my mind. \n\nThis is also the first visit since they opened the aquarium and rain forest. I felt like I was back in South Florida seeing the ocean life and feeling the warm humidity of the rain forest.	1
The Discovery Place exceeded our expectations. We heard about this and decided to check it out on our way out of town. There is soo much to see that it's a little overwhelming. Our kids are on the younger side (5 and 3) and can't read yet so some of the science things they didn't get or understand. The staff is very helpful and willing to help you with the experiments. We loved the little kid area where we could put our baby down so she could explore too! Cafeteria and parking is over priced but the cost of admission is totally worth it. Be prepared to spend at least 4 hours wandering around. Great museum! We will be visiting again!	1
Love this place!  We have come here a couple times now when we were visiting family & it was totally worth the trip (it's an hour drive).  There was so much to do & see for every age level.  We spent a lot of time playing in the water table last year when our son was only 19 months.  This year at almost 3, he was able to do a lot more so we got to bang on the drums, build monsters & play with the vacuum tubes (which were his favorite).  They had an exhibit with Frogs while we were there & I was really impressed with it - there were some cool camouflage frogs we had never seen or heard of before.\n\nThey have a lot of hands on activities for older kids as well (there was a build your own shoe with duct tape &/or tin foil) as well as a light show that looked like a dance party for kids. \n\nWe will definitely visit next time we are in town.	1
Great for kids of all ages. Admission is expensive, so if you find yourself going there more than once a year I highly suggest buying the membership. Be wary of the hours, they change throughout the seasons. Just do your homework on the place and you won't run into any problems.	1
Meh is right on for this Quizno's.  Mmmm... Toasty just doesn't cut it when the quality of meats and veg served on the bread is below par on most visits.  Prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat.  A Lobster and Seafood sub that tasted like a Salt and Seafood sub.  Cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich.\n\nThe saving grace.  When they have Clam Chowder as a soup choice, it's actually pretty good!	0
I've been there for lunch a couple of times.  The food is ok pretty much typical of a chain, if a little pricey for lunch.  Plan on giving the place a solid hour even when not busy, the kitchen is slooooooow.	0
I should have known better to go to Uno anywhere other than Chicago, but it was late and I was hungry.\n\nService was fine....I don't know what to say...expensive, restaurant should have been MUCH cleaner considering there was only about 10 people there.	0
The lunch special at the Pizzeria Uno is a good deal, so that must be why we keep going back even though we have terrible service time after time. Don't go there if you're looking for a quick lunch. The servers are usually absent-minded and it takes a while for your food to come out. The pizza is all right, but as a Chicagoan, it can't compare to the true deep dish pizza back home. If you go, the flatbread quesadillas are a good dish to try.	0
nice lobby. nice hotel. very slow internet. I realize it is free, but you shouldn't market it as a freebie if it can't be sold otherwise. Definitely no high speed at this hotel.	0
My wife and I stayed here one night because our air conditioner stopped working. The front desk was extremely helpful and friendly! The room was clean, comfortable, and they had a great complementary breakfast in the morning. Great location and a good price! I recommend you stay here if you're seeking a reasonably priced, clean, comfortable hotel!	1
Finally! I've found a good smoothie place in the area! The smoothie I got here was awesome, and (gasp) made with real fruit!! They've got so many selections to choose from and they all sound delicious. I got one from their 'healthy' menu, it was called Blueberry Heaven - it was blueberries, banana, Protein Blend & honey. I couldn't drink the thing fast enough! Total brain freeze, but so worth it. My second choice would have been pomegranate punch, which had apple juice and soy protien, and for my third it would probably be the Go Goji, which had kiwi and mango in it. \n\nThey also sell Luna Bars, Clif Bars and other power bars and healthy snacks. Reasonably priced, really clean, and friendly staff. I will be going back for more smoothies!	1
Just attempted to go there on a visit while driving through town after callin number to make sure theyre open.  Message stated they were open 11am-2am.  Parked in some sheisty lot next door for $4 to have lunch at 2pm - place had all their neon lihjts and TVs on and certainly looked like opened so I sacrificed the $4 excited about the promise of a cajun menu... Doors are closed...!?! Thanks dixies!  Had to walk 4 blocks to nearest place in freezin rain to find another spot to eat (rockbottom nearby - highly recommend) in a town where I had no probs findin a spot on a street with cheap hourly meters.. Thanks again Dixie:(	0
It reminded me of the dirty restroom at the gas station on HWY 40 driving through Texas. Dirty and nasty.	0
This is the place for wanna be steelers fans. The bathrooms are terrible, and the place smells like a dirty ashtray.  the waitresses were very rude and didnt care about your orders. I was hoping for a better experience but oh we'll.... That's why I have found a much better place to watch all the games.	0
Not sure about this place. I have eaten here before and it was decent. However, tried to have lunch with the family on Sat, 3/10/12 and the place was closed at 11:30 am. Lot's of people trying to get in to eat and nobody from Dixies around. Not sure what the problem was but we were very disappointed.\n\nWent accross the street to the Queen City BBQ and had a very nice lunch.	0
Just not my kind of place. There really wasn't anything in particular that stood out that was horrible. It lends itself to a younger crowd.  It never seems that clean. It has decent drink specials. During large events it will become incredibly packed.	0
Beware! I checked my 2 receipts from one night I was there at the end of February 2013 and found I was overcharged on my credit card statement on BOTH receipts. I called Dixie's 3x over a 10 day period, left voicemail messages because no one ever picks up the phone, and then decided to stop by to have the issue addressed. I asked politely at the bar for a manager to the same bartender who tipped himself 100%+ tip and was told he was a manager. I explained the issue and asked for a refund. I was told that he could not fix the issue then and to come back at another time in a manner that was anything but acceptable hospitality and customer service. I then asked for the card or contact information of the General Manager to which I was told that I couldn't have. What?! I immediately left, called my credit card company, and had them chargeback the establishment. I tipped 25% and you think you deserve over 100% and you illegally charge my credit card and then won't resolve the issue. Ridiculous!	0
Simply the most unique night life experience that Charlotte has to offer.\n\nIf you don't like 80's music, or similarly, don't have any sense of humor or humility, this place isn't for you.  There are dozens of meat market dance clubs available in the Uptown area.  \n\nHowever, if you're looking for a place to get drunk and dance to Micheal Jackson hits, or sip a beer and watch replays from 80's dunk competitions, this place is going to thrill you.  \n\nMost important, the vibe here is unlike any dance club I've been to.  You're far more likely to see a Sid Vicious look-alike or a break dancing session form in the middle of the floor than you are to see a shoving match or a fight break out.  \n80's music has a way of draining the aggression from testosterone pumped drunkards.  And that provides for the most enjoyable dancing experience I've had in Charlotte.\n\nEveryone looks ridiculous when they dance to 80's music.  So if you're accustomed (like I am) of looking ridiculous when you dance, you'll love The Breakfast Club.	1
I love this Dump!  Okay, so I am little biased because I am a breakdancer and finally got to meet a bunch of dancers for once. They all actually embraced me as soon as I started to boogie which was cool.  Its a great scene.  The mix in the crowd is from 21-50 which makes it a good time to mess with the cougars.  The mixed drinks are strong, but a little pricey.  Domestic beer is usually like $3. THe reason you come here though is for the 80's music, looking at people dressed in neon, and watching some old school pop and lock.  The video screens show classic 80's shots and commercials which brings me back. The only problem is that this place is semi dumpy.  Im glad its dark because I don't want to see what it looks like with all the lights on.  Also, the bathrooms could use some erggh cleaning!	1
I like going out but this place makes it hard to really want to come back.  Nothing in particular about the music or service or drinks.  It's just a worn out place.  I will say that the people watching in here is insane.  \n\nI do like the decor on the first floor, seems like a cool hangout and if I ever went back I'd probably just stay down there to soak it all in.  Upstairs is the dance floor and additional bar.  The floor was so sticky I don't see how anyone was really dancing.  I seriously thought I might be able to scale small buildings after being in there on that floor.\n\nPS. They don't even really serve breakfast.  They should think about it, then I might come back :)	0
Rude staff, run down interior, not the safest place in town.	0
As for the property its ok, but the biggest problem is the way members of the staff handle residents. Be prepared to be told one thing and then they do another. Watch out!	0
Do not go here if you want quick service.  I dropped my dry cleaning off on a Wednesday and was told it would be done by Friday.  When I went in on Friday morning he said it was not done yet and wouldn't be done until after 2pm.  Also very over priced.	0
Ruined a dress shirt that I took in with one small stain that I could live with, but I thought to give the cleaners a shot. Got my shirt back with ten or so stains just on the front. How does that happen?!  My husband picked it up without a warning and paid for it, completely unaware. First and last visit for me.	0
If you blink, you will miss this place.  That being said, that doesn't mean it isn't a great spot for lunch.  My favorite meal here is the Turkey Jezebal, thin sliced turkey, lettuce, tomato, cheese, served on a croissant style bun.  I've said it before but this sandwich proves my point that a sandwich either lives or dies by the bun in which it's made of!\n\nThe people that are behind the counter are very courteous and the service is always quick.\n\nThe interior is nothing to really write home about.  Paint CMU walls, hanging framed wall art....random art at that but that's ok.  I like random :)\n\nDefinitely a no frills spot, just good food, good service and be on your way style dining :)	1
I love this place!\nThis is a hidden gem in uptown, it's a cozy place with good food and even better service.\nThe first time I went for lunch I ordered the Baja quesadilla and I almost cried because the chicken on it tasted like a dish that we eat in Mexico. Besides the quesadilla my other two favorites are two vegetarian sandwiches Fallafel and Jeniffer, I'm not vegetarian but they are delicious.	1
Preferred Parking's rates are way too high.  We're parking in Charlotte, people, not San Francisco.  They actually want to charge me around $140/month to park in the lot near my building.  Are you kidding me?  That's what it cost to park in Chicago (and I used to work downtown).  I'm not sure if some people's companies subsidize their parking and that's why they are willing to support these crazy rates, but it just boggles my mind.  \n\nIn addition to their bad prices, their customer service is abysmal.  \nI used them for awhile when I first moved to Charlotte (parking far away from my workspace, so I could actually afford it).  But, abruptly, Preferred Parking sold the lot I parked in, never gave me any notice but did call me right before the transfer and rudely told me to find somewhere else to park.  More confusion ensued, and I ended up severing all ties with them and found another company's lot to park in. It's even further away, but worth it to no longer have to deal with Preferred Parking's bad prices and bad customer service.	0
Terrible parking company.  The rates are high considering the location of their lots.  In addition, these lots provide no security or lighting in the evening.  The only PP person around is collecting money and giving tickets, so they could care less what it is going on in the lot.  The customer service is bad and the lady you usually speak to struggles with english.  It's unfortunate such a pathetic company has a monopoly over uptown parking.	0
Want to let everyone know that, years later, Preferred Parking is still the pits. In a recent  display of lameness, they refused to clear out lots during the snowstorm for 3 days but then promptly sent their customers an email that they are planning to raise their monthly parking rates. If they weren't the ONLY company in Charlotte that had parking uptown, I would so so happily go to someone else. Unclear why there isn't any other competition here. So many people would be happy to throw anyone other than preferred parking their business.	0
"This is the most ineffectively managed company I have ever come in contact with. I cancelled my parking pass and they still accepted an accidental payment from Wage Works and refuse to refund the payment back to Wage Works/me even though I turned my pass in upon cancellation of my account and have not been parking there for two weeks. I was sent an email a month ago confirming my cancellation but when I called, I was told they \""don't do refunds.\""\nHowever, I have an email confirming they will send me a refund from when my pass would not work and the workers at the garage charged me full payment for two days ($30), which I have been waiting for for several weeks.The front desk just keeps saying \""someone in Accounts Payable will contact you.\"" I even went to their uptown office and brought my receipts hoping they would finally begin the refund process and was told to return to my office and fax the receipts. They make everything incredibly difficult and their customer service skills are extremely lacking."	0
This is, by far, the most poorly managed parking company I've ever used.  I have been parking at the Epicentre Charlotte lot for the past two years and since the location was close to my office, I have swallowed rate increase after rate increase - and dealt with the fact that on any given day only half  of their entrances/exits are actually open and functioning...  this last increase (addtl. $20/month!) was the last straw and I have decided to move elsewhere.   \n\nHowever, cancelling my parking has turned into an even worse experience - not only can you only do this online - their staff has ZERO customer service service and they are charging me to cancel my parking. GOOD RIDDANCE.	0
I love sub one hoagie house!  John and the guys are always pleasant, the food is always made fresh to order and the prices are very reasonable. I always order the jersey cheese steak with oil and vinegar, lettuce, tomato, mayo and steak sauce and it is awesome. I've been coming to sub one for over 10 years!  Love it!	1
Wonderful food, great veggie options for my friend!	1
Disgusting,  slow and pathetic.  Takes phone orders before the people standing in front of them.  Food is subpar.  Skip unless starving	0
An amazing sub for a unbelievable price... what more can you ask for?!\n\nI tried the New Jersey sub and it hit every spot. It took a little but it might be because of what I ordered with all those different ingredients to cook.\n\nI can't wait to go back to try other menu items and at large subs for less than $5 I'll be back for sure! There's no need to ever go to Subway down the street ever..!	1
It's a convenience store, like Walgreens or CVS.\n\nI came in to get an Arnold Palmer iced tea. The only person manning the counter was not to enthusiastic about working there, and constantly was checking the door. When someone came in, they gave a bland generic greeting. It felt awkward to be there.	0
Omni's are usually great places to stay. This one feels a bit old, dated and run down. The room was not very nice. Musty smelling. Bathroom was not up to par to the price of the room. I would recommend the Westin, Marriott, Dunhill for uptown instead. Hopefully they can clean the place up and improve it.	0
It was a nice hotel, and if you are member of Guest Select (which is free, by the by), you get free wi-fi and other goodies in your room.    The front desk was very helpful with printing out boarding passes and the exercise room had water for you to rehydrate.\n\nI also had to take a cab to the airport at 4:30 in the morning, and they made sure that I wasn't waiting around for that.\n\nMy knocks on the place are few, but should be noted.  The AC was on 63 when I got there.  Completely jet lagged, I fell asleep with that running all night and was definitely feeling sick the next morning. blech.   Also, the shower took a tad bit of time to get warm.	1
Wireless connection at this place is HORRIBLE. NASCAR event was right outside our hotel so it was as loud as can be. However, staff was nice and accommodating. Unsure if it's just southern hospitality or if they're actually good workers - either way, not worth it. If I were back in Charlotte and needed to be close to the Federal Courthouse would I stay here? Probably not. Westin would be a better choice for a little more money.	0
I recently stayed here during a business trip, and it was so bad I had to cut my stay short and go to another hotel.\n\nI've stayed at the LA Omni numerous times, and they have nice accommodations, great service and I like staying there.  I was hoping to have a similar experience and was thoroughly disappointed.\n\nI stayed on the preferential floors, but even then the rooms were horrible.  Small, old furniture, old TV, dingy, musty, small bathroom, stains on the ceiling etc.  I was starting to get depressed just being there.  \n\nRoom service was mediocre, the complimentary drink service was not well presented, came too early, way before my requested time when I wasn't awake yet (they knocked at 5:30am).  \n\nIt's right in front of the Epicenter so on Thursdays when they have bands playing there at night time, I'm sure it's really really loud.\n\nThe pool is this round small pool, that I didn't even attempt to go into.\n\nWill not stay there again until they have a major remodel of the entire inside of the hotel.	0
My in-law stayed here while visiting/job interviewing a few days ago, so based on her feedback...\n\nThe staff was happy and helpful, and she got a pretty good deal through Orbitz.- the cost ended up being only a few more dollars per night than the shiesty Holiday Inn that the company she was interviewing for had put her up in.  The location is quite ideal for uptown shenanigans.  And yes, the beds here are FIRM.  I would hate it, but she likes a firm mattress.\n\nHowever, these fools need to invest in some sound proofing.  Bands are often playing in front of Bank of America next door,the EpiCentre entertainment complex is also nearby, and frankly this city is growing so it ain't gonna get any quieter.  Staying on the 12th floor, windows shut, and already a light sleeper, this was, in short, a problem.  So fix it.	0
Let's be honest with each other on this review. Yes, it's downtown Charlotte, NC but who cares. For the prices that this hotel charges, they can do much better. I'd suggest that they call the Omni in Pittsburgh and find-out how its done.	0
Substandard - not a good hotel for business, and desperately in need of a renovation.  1. Hallways and rooms were dim, though the beds were comfortable.  2. There were no outlets anywhere near the desk to plug a phone/laptop in to. 3.  Furniture was very dated.  4.  Rooms were not quiet to say the least.  I could hear alarms and laughter from two different sides, and I had a marching band (!) playing outside my window for over an hour between 8 and 9pm.  I'll stay elsewhere next time I'm in town.	0
"Wow...if you are familiar with the Omni in San Diego, or Dallas DO NOT come here expecting the same!! I would like to say this is a Holiday inn dressed up in a high rise but that would be doing a disservice to the Holiday Inn! The hotel feels old, rooms are tiny, and mustier than your grandma's basement. Beds feel like springy cement and AC rattles like a cage all through the night. I expected more from a name like Omni and pay per day Wifi! Are you serious it's??!! It's 2012!! Next time I will run not walk to the aloft down the street I only wish I knew there was one here sooner Omni Charlotte you get 1 star and 5 \""BOOOOOOOOOs\"""	0
For the price this is a 2 star.  For location this place is a 4 star.  The rooms are small and they even gave me a corner room that said was bigger.  I would hate to see what a normal room looks like.  The corner room has 2 full size beds and is like a triangle.  You do have space but very little and the bathrooms well the toilet and the shower are like touching each other.  You can barely close the bathroom door if you want to do business in private!  The corner rooms also that face 4th street just expect a night of loud music as that side faces several rooftop bars and they play music loud late into the night.  Only saving grace is putting in the AC fan but that is loud as well.  Either music or white noise.  The signature lounge...again...small.  Overall the lobby is nice, nice restaurant and attached to BofA and the center of town with everything in walking distance.  As I said....for location unbeatable.  For a luxury hotel for the price NOPE.	0
Great location but not the best value.  Tiny bathrooms - could barely close the door with the rug.  Noisy guests had a party - we could hear the door slam as our beds were positioned on the wall of the hall.  Poor design.  Security finally broke the party up at 1:30 am.  Lots of other hotel choices in the area.	0
"I recently stayed at the Omni in Charlotte, NC for the week of the Democratic National Convention. While the hotel has a great location and friendly staff, I slept on a cot for three nights and became infected with BEDBUGS and had to go to the ER when I got home today for treatment. First we thought it was fleas, then scabies but apparently it is really BEDBUGS....the WORST.  The hotel told me they were going to have to do \""tests\"" to be sure the bugs came from their hotel, but two doctors so far and my own common sense suggest I got them from bedding at the Omni. The hotel does not seem very interested in dealing with the situation either; I have talked to them many times this week and they have not told me about any corrective measures. BEWARE."	0
"Hair in the sheets and stain on the pillow! Yuk!!!!! I don't think they changed the sheets. Maybe the previous guest made the bed, so the roomkeeper left it? I don't know, but it gave me the creeps, and we looked closely at everything else and found everything grungy. On the surface, it looks OK, but OMG, it is GROSS!!!!!!!\n\nStaff was very curt bordering on rude. No smiles anywhere, just treated us like cattle - unwanted cattle at that. Don't dare ask for clean sheets..... you may become a \""problem guest\"" and get the hairy eyeball for the rest of your visit.\n\nIs it unreasonable to expect CLEAN SHEETS? This place is not cheap. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but nor do I expect to be treated like a bum off the sttreet!!!!"	0
Just attended a conference for four nights. Got great service from every single encounter - front desk, housekeeping, bartender, parking valet. I don't write many reviews, but felt compelled because I really enjoyed my stay. Terrific breakfast buffet, hot beverage delivered to my room with newspaper every morning, turn-down service. Everything I asked for, and more.	1
Painfully Blah, older business hotel that needs updates and upgrades.  \nThe Good: Central Location, Clean, Friendly Staff \nThe Bad: Paid $300+ for a blah hotel, rooms are old and out-dated, internet is really really slow for a business hotel, food is mediocre. \nNot a fan of this large downtown business hotel. Omni's can be hit or miss, this is a miss. Room decor is old and bed was not comfortable. Internet was super-slow, really? In 2012? TV was newer, but remote was terrible. Small bathroom, loud heater-A/C.  I did like the location and service was very friendly (front desk, valet, concierge, bellman, room service). But, I simply cannot explain how they can charge $300+ on a busy week. That's more than the Ritz in most towns. Meh. Needs total re-do to be worthy. Charlotte is really weak on nice business hotels... The RItz... and then what? Amazingly average hotels here, even name chains (Marriott, Westin, Omni).	0
Stayed here for the Belk bowl.  Great location all kinds of restaurants nearby and the football and basketball stadiums are in walking distance. \nThe staff was friendly and helpful from the valet to the check in to the food service.  The room was good, it actually had king size pillows for a king size bed!!  There is a Walgreens downstairs for items you forgot to pack.	1
As others have mentioned -- this hotel is extremely outdated. The location is perfect, however! The parking area opens directly (across the street) to the elevators that lead to the Epicenter. \n\nThe staff seemed ok, but it just could not make up for the room. Everything felt so old. Old towels, old decor, old carpet, old halls. \n\nI would not stay again, unless a major renovation takes place.	0
"Decent hotel downtown but has noise problem.\n\nEverything was more or less ok except for the noise.  Entertainment district across the way had throbbing disco beat that  wouldn't let us sleep.  .  Had to change rooms with my 3 kids at 02:30 a.m and we were flying back to Germany the next morning.\n\nAsk for room on side not facing entertainment district or simply book elsewhere.  Otherwise you will NOT get a good night's sleep.  It is simply inexcusable to book a nice downtown Hotel in a supposedly \""World\"" city and feel like you're trying to sleep directly on the disco dance floor.  This Hotel is in need of sound-proofing renovations.\n\nExtra note in case Omni reads this.  You should sue the pants off the entertainment district for the late night noise."	0
This hotel is centrally located and there is plenty around to eat and do for those staying here while in town for work. They also were very accommodating when I required transportation in the early morning hours and arranged car service for me. \n\nHowever, my room was foul. Not the worst or most disgusting I've ever stayed in but it was gross. The walls were bubbling and discolored, it smelled dingy and the air conditioning didn't convince me it worked appropriately. \nThe worst was that the shower didn't drain and every time I showered I was standing in water up to my calves. \n\nI had much higher expectations for an Omni. I've stayed in Holiday Inns that were nicer.	0
The hotel is in downtown Charlotte and is with an area of night clubs with loud outdoor music.  Was in town for Business and was not able to sleep for two nights due to loud banks in the area.\nThe rooms and halls smell MUSTY and DAMP!!\nThe menu for the restaurant/lounge needs some updating.  There is LIMITED items for those looking for a healthy diet.\nWill not be my choice for future stays in Charlotte.	0
Stayed here because I was in town for a wedding. Hadn't stayed here in years. It could use some updating but the rooms are still nice and comfy. But, the staff are what make this hotel awesome. Everyone was so nice. They know your name and take care of your every need. The location is also great. You can walk anywhere you need to go. I've always hated the entrance to the hotel but again, this is where the wonderful staff make this hotel with a strange entrance a great experience. \n\nParking is $15 a day. Valet parking is $22 a day. \n\nAlso know that it's location is great for eating and hanging out. The epicenter along with many other places are close by. One thing you must remember when staying here, it is uptown so it can be very noisy outside and you will hear it in your room.	1
"Made a reservation in May through Expedia, which I needed to cancel.  I called the hotel and cancelled, and was told I'd be charged a $25 cancellation fee.  Well, lo and behold, Oct 7, I saw a charge to my card for $435.00.  Called the hotel and was told that the charge was for the cancellation back in May.  I explained what happened and was told that there was nothing they could do.  \""who did you talk to\"", they asked?  Sure, I wrote that down and remembered it 6 months later.  Not.  So, obviously will not be staying there on future visits to Charlotte."	0
Reid's is a fun little market where you can find eclectic grocery items that you might not find anywhere else.  It's fun to browse the few aisles to see what else is in the world out there besides what's offered in your local Harris Teeter.  The only bad thing is that the pricing is a little higher than I usually like to pay, but it's fun to splurge every once in awhile.  \n\nIf you're hungry, grab a small bite at the cafe or hot bar and sit indoors or outdoors (and watch the lightrail pass by).  Again, prices are a little higher for the basically self-serve food items, but sometimes you've just gotta support your local non-chain markets.	1
Went here on a Tuesday night w/out reservations in an effort to try something new. Great wine list with both affordable and expensive options. The decor is cool and the atmosphere seemed lively. Great spot for work dinners or events. But the food was just not good, especially at the prices they are charging. For $20, small portion of flavorless halibut, no side included and halibut was like cardboard. Really boring beef carpacchio and bland herb risotto. I never complain about service, but they did not bus surrounding tables for over 30 mins and for a dinner/drinks bill of $100+ it would be nice to not stare at unfinished food for the entire meal.\n\nIt is very possible we caught this place on an off night, but I doubt it. Go for drinks, eat elsewhere.	0
"I appreciate small, quaint bookstores and I understand that the big box Barnes & Nobles can be a bit frustrating. But there's a difference between a \""Mom 'n' Pop\"" book shop and a poorly-stocked one with books that pertain to a really limited scope of interest. I was in here early one weekday afternoon and I was the only person in the store. The few shelves of books they have at The Bookmark were somewhat sparsely stocked. The store has little atmosphere and seems out of place in Founder's Hall. I mean, I'm sure they could order whatever you'd like, but you'll need to wait a while and you'll also pay through the nose for it--publisher's price--because they do have to pay uptown rent after all. \n\nWhen I walk into a bookstore I like to be inspired to read and I want to be excited by what's on the shelves. I could spend hours in a Barnes & Noble just pulling interesting stuff off the shelves and perusing the pages. There's not really an opportunity for any of that at this place."	0
Lunch is casual and reasonably priced. The Cubanos and shoe-string fries are great---not quite up to the level of what you can get in southern FL, but still pretty good for this area. Lunches are generally busy, but I've rarely had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table.\n\nThe dinner menu is much more expensive than lunch and the atmosphere changes...it's almost like two different restaurants. It's still not bad, though, and the food is so good that I think it's worth the extra cash. The Arepas con Cerdo appetizer is excellent...one of my favorite things in Charlotte dining. The few times I've gotten the fish it has been overcooked, so I generally stick to the land-animal entrees. Overall it's a really nice regular lunch spot, and a good place for an occasional dinner.	1
Yum yum yum!!! LaTorre's is one of my favorite lunch spots and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been!  My personal fave is the Pollo Chipotle sandwich with skinny fries.  Their food is amazing and the prices aren't too bad either.\n\nI have a slight issue with LaTorre's and here it is:  Once upon a time, I asked for the Cubano sandwich but with NO mustard.  Well, Mr. Waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable to alter them in any way.  Hmm...pre-made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine?  I'm a skeptic.  After asking around, I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT pre-made but the managers/chefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush.  My point:  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce, don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you!  By the way, my spy happens to be an employee so I know it's true.  \n\nAll in all, this place is great.	1
Tennis sale anyone?! Don's tennis has had a sale every time I've driven by. Located at the intersection of Morehead and McDowell, Don's tennis has everything a tennis fan/player would want. Tennis channel on the small TV all day. Demo racquets available. Every racquet you could want is for sale here, as well as shoes, balls, bags, hoppers, string, grips, etc, etc. Don is there most days and provides some fast talking, but is genuine in his advice and feedback. Usually a full time stinger working too, so getting your racquet re-strung same day usually isn't an issue.\n\nOne point to mention...only cash or check...no plastic.	1
Great place to grab lunch on a beautiful day.\n\nI had the French Quarter Salad w/ grilled chicken and it was fantastic. Service was good and the food came relatively fast for a lunch rush. The best part of the experience was eating outside on a beautiful day, when we went inside to pay it was pretty loud.	1
Salads are good, but this place's secret is their Thursday special, Baked Chicken.  French Quarter is busy for lunch every day.  Indoor seating is limited, but creates good atmosphere for this place.  They are usually open before Panther games. \n\nTip:\nTo avoid the weekday lunch rush, I recommend arriving no later than 11:30 a.m., or you'll stand in line to get in.  They offer outside seating when the weather is nice.	1
On my first day working in CLT, my team member raved about this restaurant and their daily lunch specials.\n\nSooooo, the Shrimp Creole, in a nutshell is one of the Tuesday specials. Its pretty much rice (that's not cooked all the way), embryo shrimp (of the frozen kind from your local grocer), and red spicy sauce (umm, creole sauce?). I tried my best, but I could only eat a 1/4 of the plate, and really that much b/c I was hungry. \n\nWe were seated quickly and the food came in 6min....so I was able to make it back to the office ontime. Guess that's worth 2 stars eh?	0
"This place is downright bizarre.  it's run by the same people who run Greek Isles, which means most of the menu is Greek with some pasta and \""creole\"" items.  I say \""creole\"" because there is like 2 items on the menu that are supposed to be New Orleans style and those at the tables around us who ordered the special (chicken creole) left most of it on their plate. \n\nI had a caesar salad and it, I kid you not, comes out in a mixing bowl.  it's huge and really a total waste of salad because it would take 3-4 people to finish one.  I barely made a dent in it.  The salad was just alright, nothing terribly impressive.  \n\nDuring the week it's full of blue shirts watching ESPN."	0
Went here on a football Sunday and I was told that the menu was reduced to be quick and more American. This was a disappointment to me as I would not mind waiting for some good French cuisine. I ordered the only traditional plate left on the menu, avoiding the burgers and fries... it was good but there are better places and better food. I don't know much about about French food so I was curious. The music was too loud an rappish (or R&B) so, although I dined alone, I would imagine it would be difficult to carry a conversation. The staff was friendly and service good but that is not enough to bring me back so I will not repeat.	0
Visited on Friday 3/25 for supper. I was really looking forward to a good Cajun meal. Out of fish on a Friday????  Are you kididng? And, crab soup so salty, was not edible. The waitress, who was really good, did not charge for it after complaining. Rice and beans pretty good, and wait staff quite attentive. I really did expect better. Will not be going there again.	0
I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. \n\nThey are known for their southern, Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical, heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually, but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it, but it wasn't for me. \n\nIt gets pretty crowded during lunch hours, and the spaces are quite tight.	0
Went here on a weekday night. I didn't like it and I probably won't be back.	0
"Very confused by this spot.  When I lived up town (2012), I remember this place being very different.  The location is so so amazing so I hope they really step their game up. They are right across from the brand new park Uptown.  They advertise their dishes to be \""comfort food with a touch of cajun\"" but that really doesnt come through at all.  It is simply a Greek restaurant called French Quarter.  \n\nHaving said that, they do have very good daily lunch specials and numerous local beers on tap up at the bar.  I have stopped in here a few times for a quick lunch while at work and ordered the chicken tips.  The best part was the gravy.  Everything else... so-so.  \n\n-Ian M."	0
Came with with friends during lunch. Very busy with short wait times. Very loud too. Difficult to hold conversations. Seating too close together. \n\nWaitress was polite and very attentive. I had the Friday special- salad and cup of lobster soup. Very basic. Soup was mediocre. Definitely not homemade.	0
The experience I had here at the clinic was one of the best I've had at a big hospital.  It might have helped that I was the first appointment of the day, but for a mandatory yearly ritual it was quite enjoyable.  Dr. Karner was very attentive and really listened to my input and opinions about my treatment.  So since I have to spend 1-2 hour of my life every year getting pointlessly getting checked out, I'm glad I chose to do it here.	1
"My bosses used to drag me here for business get-togethers and meetings.\n\nI know it's hard to imagine hating a place where someone else has picked up the tab. But consistently, once the waiters figure out who's paying, if it's not you, forget it.\n\nBut I guess what the Aquavina staff can't figure out is, if they treat you badly when you're not paying, you won't return when it's your turn to pick up the tab. And I've had such consistently mediocre to bad service here, that will never happen.\n\nI once waited an hour for a drink and chips that never came, surrounded by a dozen people eating and drinking. What a lovely time. \n\nThat same night, asking the \""greeter\"" at the door to help find my party drew nothing but a blank stare, and I had to wander the place looking for them.\n\nIt's not always THAT bad, but it's never met expectations.\n\nFor the record: I've had lunch and attended social get-togethers there. It's been about two years since I've been there. The very last time I went, service was tolerable."	0
The lunch service is absolutely horrible.  I work in the building so my co-workers like to eat here.  Soda is always flat and service is very inconsistent.	0
We had a few cocktails here during a rained-out event they put on with the Young Affiliates of the Mint Museum. The venue was very trendy and relaxing. I enjoyed the furniture and thought it was a great spot to grab a nice glass of wine or a cocktail. You're in such a fabulous location in the middle of everything and I can imagine the view is quite nice when it isn't so crowded.\n\n I am not sure if they were solely in charge of food, but my one complaint is that it was very sparse at an event featuring quite a bit of wine directly after work. The event  flyer specifically mentioned food so that was a bit of a let down as I was definitely hungry towards the end. Overall they handled the rain situation smoothly so they get kudo's for that!	1
Recently had dinner, she had caesar salad + lobster mac, I had caesar salad + salmon dinner. Unfortunately, we were both ill after. Nothing else to eat since morning & felt good all day. Next day when I informed managing partner Blerim Meta, he claimed his food could not make us sick that quickly. Disappointing reaction. I can't imagine going anywhere at any level & getting such dismissive teatment.	0
Just have to say my room had a missing light bulb to help hide dinginest. Left in 3 minutes and booked room across the street at La Quinta.  Paid more but will sleep better. Wish I could have given Red Roof a quarter of a star.	0
DON'T STAY HERE. room was not clean had coke bottle and spit cup with cig but ts in it and read of urine.  Crack head central. Canceled reservation and found another place.	0
"It's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy. But, a ghetto with new bed dressing and a half assed paint job is still a ghetto. Even the \""newly renovated\"" room we asked for, since only 50% are, is disgusting and not actually renovated. It's just a shoddy job of putting lipstick on a very nasty pig."	0
This is a standard gas station and not really worth reviewing. I just wanted to say that if you can, avoid this station. It's super sketchy at night--lots of unsavory characters lurking around. I definitely kinda feel unsafe, so head elsewhere to fill up if you can, especially if it's nightime!	0
Fast fast fast diner food.   Delicious Chicken Pot Pie!  Seriously, we went for lunch and i SWEAR the waitress took our order, walked back to the kitchen and returned with our food.   Southern Home cooking Fast.	1
Had to wait for my husband to arrive at Charlotte airport, since I was flying in from a different city. Came to Gardenia cause it was close to airport and rental car company. Best home style southern cooking I've had in a long time! And the prices were on the really inexpensive side. Loved that the waitresses knew the regulars by name!	1
I am not sure how someone thinks this food is great.  It is subpar and out of the freezer.  There is no way that this is Southern fare that is good or even tasteful.  Nothing is homemade and food is dry.  Service is nice and the lobby is good.  But please close and stop serving food that comes out of the freezer.  Grocery stores are always open.	0
"Arrived and waited for 10 minutes before I grabbed a menu and asked an employee if the guests were supposed to seat themselves.. He responded \""You can\"" and walked by with out furthering assisting me."	0
From my one and only visit today so far, I rate this restaurant poorly because it took the server a long time to come to my table after I was seated. I ordered something on the menu called Sly Scottie because next to it in italics it said 'We're famous for this one!' It sounded okay: Turkey, broccoli, and cranberry sauce on top of a muffin (they mean English muffin). But when it came out it just looked like a bowl of lard. It also felt like I was eating a bowl of lard. I should have probably ordered from the diet menu. Haven't had this bad of an experience in a while.	0
Hit and miss for lunch and summer. Was told that veggies were all fresh, no way..breakfast better. Homefries good. Omlettes dry and not so good.	0
Rough start for lunch. Waitress with an attitude.	0
I am a big fan of breakfast & brunch, so I am always on the lookout for new options.  One Sunday, I decided to check this place out instead of going to my usual brunch place.  Sad to say, this was a big mistake.  For me, they did not have a good breakfast/brunch menu.. the offerings were very limited in comparison to other area brunch spots. But, I found something that sounded ok, and placed my order.  \n\nUnfortunately, the service was very slow and I waited forever for my food to come out - and it was not even anything special - scrambled eggs, home-fries, and toast.  Even worse than the slow service, was the fact that my food was cold and flavorless.   The price point was not bad, but I will not be back because I was not at all happy with the quality of the food.	0
While some people might not think Park Road Books measures up to a huge chain like Border's, this shop is every bit as good in terms of books and customer service.  Park Road Books is one of the few remaining independently owned book stores in Charlotte and it deserves our support.  Due to size, it doens't have quite the selection of a store like Borders, but they have good fiction and children's sections, and be sure you will find all the classics here.  If there is something you want that they don't have just ask, they'll be happy to order it for you.	1
I love that I've found a bookstore that isn't a chain. As much as Borders and Barnes are tried and true, it's refreshing to know that an indy is still around. They've got racks of books outside that will charm you and entice you to come inside, and once you do you'll be sure to find a great selection and gifty items on top of it. Brides, they give away a complimentary bridal book with lots of great resources - it's pretty thick! ;)	1
Great, independent bookstore! I ventured in here for the first time a few days ago and will definitely be back. It's a nice change of pace from the over-sized mega bookstores out there and has a nice, small town feel to it. I love the handwritten recommendations from the staff on the books and the huge selection of planners, journals, notecards, etc. They host a number of authors doing discussions and signings from what I can see on their calendar (bummed I missed Chelsea Handler though) No, they don't have the selection of the huge bookstores or all the glitz and glitter but I feel a little better knowing that my money is going to the local economy to keep it running.	1
For as many times I have been to Park Road Shopping Center, I don't think I ever came inside Park Road Books. I'm glad I took a stroll inside this weekend. I love book stores, I love it even more when it's local and not big box (which are all dying down anyhow). \nBefore you enter the store, there're carts of used books on sale (think $4 for a hardback) on the sidewalk. At the entrance they post upcoming author/book signing events (unfortunately they tend to be mid-day on weekdays when most are at work). \nOnce entered, the first few shelves have feature books (ex. they're offering a discount on the 1st shelf of NY Times Bestsellers). There is a small sitting area as well in the middle toward the back. \nIt was a quick visit. I didn't get to browse long, but I was there long enough to see 2 new books I want to read. \nStop by, buy a book, support a local bookstore!	1
I absolutely Love Harold and the staff at Brownlee Park Road. I Have been their customer for over 20 years now, and would not think of doing business with any other jeweler.  Why is that? Great value, great service - CONSISTENTLY.   Pat J. Schulz  (Charlotte, NC) - FB	1
We purchased our wedding bands from the Park road location. The service was excellent helping us find exactly what we were looking for. When no wedding band matched exactly, we had ours custom made and they came out even better than expected. They were up front about the timing and what they would do to make the molding etc. I enjoyed my experience with brownlee jewelers and the staff. I will go back for my next jewelery purchase.	1
Great service.  Total transaction took about 15mins. Got $722 for five pcs of old jewelry. I almost fell out when Michelle told me the amount. Lol	1
Some nice settings for rings but some of the center stones were literally yellow to the eye and priced at $3000+. They definitely need to look at their inventory, quality and pricing. Wouldn't go back.	0
You better run from this place.  The owner must be a crook!  Our house was burglarized and the police found our very expensive watch for sale at this store.  My husband went with the detective to pick up the watch and the owner was rude and arrogant.  The police told us multiple times that this business is well known for buying stolen goods off the street and they continue to buy items from criminals although the police keep coming to their store and identifying stolen goods.  If you buy something from these guys you better make sure it has papers, authenticity and can be verified that it wasn't stolen.  Too bad that a local business would do this to their own clientele.	0
I got a tattoo of Africa on my chest here when I turned 18 to remind me of my many summers spent in Kingston, Jamaica, and I was happy with the result.  However, this place is the Walmart of tattoo parlors.  If you are getting a tattoo without much detail, I would recommend coming here.  But, if you are looking to get any kind of tattoo with an intricate design, I would recommend Immortal Images, because this place accepts anyone as employees.  \n\nNonetheless, all of the employees are friendly, but demented.  The girl who tattoed me claimed to be a vampire and played heavy metal during the entire experience.  Come here for simple work!	0
I got a piercing here when I was 18 - after I had already pierced myself several times. I know, I know - but I'm not a sadist. Anyhow, out of all the piercings I did myself non of them got infected. The one I got done here was infected for months! blech! i guess when you pay $20 for someone to jab some metal into you you should just expect that. Of course, from what I understand this is where you go to get your experience in the tatoo industry and once you've perfected your craft you move on to a more reputable shop. That could be totally bogus but I'm leaning more towards that explanation.	0
"HORRIBLE customer service. I was called at 7:30 am to schedule a service call (having not spoke to the company before) telling me they would be there in 2 hours.\n\nWe had a bad connection and got disconnected. When they called me back the gentleman said \""Get your damn phone fixed\"". Yes, I heard that.\n\nWhen I called this afternoon to schedule service I mentioned the disappointment with the call this morning. Jack (was the name I was given) said go find someone else for service, he did not want me as a customer. HOW RUDE!!!\n\nThis is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Not a way to gain a new customer!!"	0
Wow- similar experience as other reviewers.  Purchased Lg\nDishwasher from Best Buy. On the 2nd load every it refused to turn off. Called LG and they sent Carolina  Appliance. First go around - not too bad. After it was fixed - same thing. LG and BEst Buy promised a replacement but Carolina appliance had to sign off on it as a lemon . \n\nthe owner was beyond rude!!!! Made many promises and failed to keep them. Claimed his repair guy  was out of cell range all day. \n\nHe started taunting me -Serves you right for shopping at Best Buy he says. Maybe you should call the Geek Squad.\n\nAsked hubs to call - 30 seconds into the the call, the guy is out if control. He get Threatened him and hung up. \n\nWe were also being held hostage by This guy at Carolina Appliance - as they won't release us so LG could assign another repairman. \n\nI'm really thinking this guy has some serious anger management issues!\n\nThe final result - DW was used two times- Best Buy took it back and we are waiting for our Bosch.	0
Very rude and unprofessional guy! Not willing to work out anything with the customer. Very short on the phone. I called for some appliance repair... Called back after almost a week and flat out said he was booked for over a week. He did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time. Would not recommend this company to anyone.	0
I could have sworn I've wrote a reveiw on this place since i'm here about every Third weekend. ahhh o well\n\nanyway.. @ Lauren P... I'm coming for that Dutch Badge... lol\nIf you've been to a Wal-Mart then you been here. \nIf you've heard many comedy stand up about this place.. welp.. you've been here\nIf you can imagin Wally World on Red Bull... then... welp yelpers.. you've guessed it!\n\nIf you under/overtstand the concept (Cosco's, Bj's) then welp. yet again.. you've been here.\n\nnothing about this place that stands out. I like it, I use it often.\n\nGo early Saturdays... free samples of a lot of different things.	1
I went here for cheaper gas without the drive all the way down to the South Carolina border. Then I had the thought hey might as well check out the store while I'm here!\n\nI actually appreciate people who buy in bulk, it uses a lot less resources to package everything when you do that and indirectly help the environment yay! What happened was I saw a bunch of individually packaged things packaged into one big thing. Well that's sure different, way to waste money on that. The store itself is fairly clean and generic. I did find some cool organic detergent to try out and bought a few baguettes as well as a cheap bottle of wine that I ended up liking quite a bit. Then when I finished checking out I had to get my receipt checked when walking out, geez do they treat everyone like a potential thief here?\n\nI don't like Walmart due to long queues, shoddy service, shoddy products, and shoddy employment practices. But Sam's Mart has relatively short queues, and uh well I guess that's all I can really say.	0
False advertisement on gas prices:\n\nThe gas price on the boards inside the store and in front of the store was different from the  price at the pump. After I pumped my gas, I realized that I was charged more.  The attendant told me that the prices on the pump are changed by the corporate office and the store doesn't always keep up with the boards.\nI called to speak to the manager and after being transferred, he/she never answered the phone.  There was no voicemail option.  This was the second time they tricked me. Grrr!	0
"I called this Sam's Club to order some sheet cakes on behalf of a friend who is a member and was going to be the one picking up the cakes. The \""ladies\"" in the bakery who answered the phone were extremely rude and unhelpful, even when I asked to speak to a manager. I have never in my life encountered such awful customer service. I told them to forget it and that I was going to get cakes through a local grocery store chain... and I did. We will never use Sam's Club again."	0
I am so sick of Walmart and Sam's Club associates. My visit today at Sam's Club was beyond aggravating. I understand you have to have a membership to shop and I was going to apply for one today but soon as I walked in the door which was about 3:00pm this lady or so call greeter was very disrespectful and didn't even give me a chance to go get me a membership card. She kept asking if I had a card and I said no I going to apply for one right now. I wanted to cuss her out so bad but I didn't. And the next time she does something like that again I will tell her about herself. Both Walmart and Sam's Club need to learn valuable customer service.	0
Walmart on steroids... Customer service is a joke. I cancelled my Sam's membership because of the lack of customer service at this store! Sam's Club is fine as long as you don't ever have to interact with an employee.	0
This place is a great frame place!  I got some custom work done here, and it was done super well!  It is a little pricey, but I was a very important piece, so it made it well worth it!	1
I love some BBQ, but Sonny's just doesn't cut it for me. First of all, this place is a franchise so that's automatically blasphemy in the BBQ world. I love some hometown BBQ & going into a place a franchised BBQ place just isn't on my list of favorite things to do.\n\nTheir BBQ is good & you can order family style, so everything here is not so bad. But there are plenty of other better, hometown BBQ joints close by in Charlotte. Sonny's doesn't have anything that's spectacular, but you'll leave full & satisfied.\n\nBut for my money, I'd rather get some better BBQ, at a better price, from a hometown place. If you don't mind the franchise feel added into your BBQ eating experience, then you won't mind heading to Sonny's to get filled up. But for me, you'll enjoy your BBQ much better from a local place with local recipes.	0
Service & food was great . Would go again .	1
I was in a time-crunch and starving and chose this Sonny's over some nearby chain restaurants. I'd been to a Sonny's a couple years back on a visit to Florida (when I was living in NY) and thought it was decent reasonably priced BBQ. Now that I live in NC and frequently travel to the BBQ capitols of the world (TX, TN, SC, NC) I know what the best BBQ should be. In fact, just a week before I'd had some of the best BBQ I'd ever eaten on a visit to Fort Worth. By comparison, the grub at this place was not nearly as good as what I'd remembered it to be. My chicken was bone dry, the ribs were small and dry, and the pulled pork was ok but unremarkable. That said, my server was friendly, the cost was low, the food came fast, and there was a decent amount of food for the price. I probably won't return to a Sonny's again unless I'm in a similar jam to this past time.	0
The best bbq in the world, I'm pretty sure. A great menu and very friendly staff. The cornbread alone will change your life! I would definitely recommend Sonny's to everyone!	1
Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there.	0
"Sonny's was a little disappointing.  Now, we went on Father's Day and dads eat free, which was cool...if I had to pay full price for what I ate, I would be very upset.  I got a \""rack\"" of ribs...spare ribs.  Just because they are not baby backs, it doesn't mean that they can't be tender people.  I don't understand how a pit smoked rib can be so tough and hard to get off the bone.  Its \""Fall off the bone\"" and \""Stick to your ribs\"" not \""Stick to the bone\""  The salad bar was the very definition of nothing special.  I don't think I will be craving the food anytime soon. \n\nWhat saved it was the service.  The kitchen screwed up our order and we had a large party but our server handled it very well.  I could tell that she had a long shift already but she was bright and cheerful towards us.  She covered the mistakes well and offered great service and was right on the spot with refills.  \n\nDon't think I'll be back, unless Jim N Nicks and Macs Speed Shop burns down...together"	0
I only eat here occasionally because a couple of my co-workers like it.  Bland bbq, bland chicken.  OK salad bar.  Overpriced for the quality.  I have never understood the allure of this chain.	0
I visited around lunch time and the food was not that good. I was expecting it to be a lot tastier. The entree was a  dry. I's a good thing I had sauce. I am sorry, but I won't be back.	0
Drive thru issues and rude manager. \nMy order was wrong and there was no cars in the parking lot.  So Im not sure what their issue was today. When I made the complaint and asked to speak to the manager. She didn't care what I thought and dismissed me completely. She even rolled her eyes at me.\nI have been a customer here since the 1980s and have never been treated like this.  \nThe food was as good as it always is. I recommend you avoid the tyvola location..	0
Came with the family of 5 for lunch on Sunday. All of the food was good. I had the dry rub ribs and was probably the one item I would less likely try again. The ribs were cooked to perfection but the rub lacked flavor. I had the homemade beans and  Mac and cheese, both were delicious! My daughter had the wet ribs and only shared a single bite (don't blame her a bit). They were also done to perfection and the sauce had more flavor. Wife had the pulled pork and was impressed. She grew up near Lexington, NC so she knows her BBQ. I was also allowed only a single bite and was also very impressed. They offer several sauces at the table and each had a very unique flavor. Service was good, glassed stayed full and bill came at the correct time. I found that the amt was kinda high for all lunch entree's when 2 of the meals were kids meals. The total without tip was $48.00. Worth a try and I will return when in the area.	1
Very good and consistent barbecue! I've had the dry rub ribs why were meaty and flavorful. I've also had the smoked turkey and brisket sandwiches which were both great- authentic, tasty, with a nice smokey flavor to them. The meat is the best here and one of my favorite bbq places in town. \n\nAs for sides, they are a bit disappointing.  The cornbread is ok, I don't like the corn pieces in it really. The fries kind of a look like cheap looking store bought crinkle cut fries and they are always soggy and limp as a take out order. \n\nI have also been to the Mooresville branch which is consistent too. So depending on which part of the city you live in, you can plan accordingly. \n\nTIP: If you go through the drive thru expect to wait longer than a fast food drive thru. The attendant who serves me at this location always smiles and is pleasant.	1
This is my go to place when in Charlotte I have been going here for years and they have only gotten better as times goes by. I always have the sampler plate and everything on it is top notch. Another thing I like about it is consistently great service and fair prices for 20 bucks I can get a great dinner and service. Keep up the good work sonny's	1
im a carolina bbq fan.  and sorry..but this bbq is just no that good.  its fast food bbq.  why not do real bbq sonny?  i dont want mcribs from a carolina bbq place	0
How dies this place have 3,5 stars.   I don't know where to start.  Food isn't even Sonny's quality,    No liquor here, beer only the owner doesn't want wine because he is a christian.   Really.   God turned water into wine     Well i will never be back.   Sonny's corporation would be disappointed.	0
I wrote a book at Coffeeworks, or at least a good chunk of one. It's a great place to hang out and work. I usually hang out here on Saturdays before a standing 6:00 date, so I know the place well.\n\nSometimes, there are lots of angsty, purple-haired teens hanging around the place, and occasionally there have been old farty-types arguing loudly about politics...but other than the sometimes unpleasant noise, it tends to be a pretty laid-back shop. \n\nTheir smoothies are delicious, and the coffee is good. I agree with Garrett G that the chocolate coffee beans are indeed delicious and sickening. The music is just loud enough to hear, but not so loud that you can't think.\n\nThey have a decent selection of things to eat. It's not a place for lunch or anything, but they have the standard coffee-shop style foods you'd expect...biscotti (Try the grasshopper mint!) and muffins and scones and other pastries.	1
We popped into CoffeeWorks on a dreary, overcast day and were greeted by a friendly woman behind the counter.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had flavored coffee!   Other than my favorite coffee chain (Barnie's Coffee, which is slowly closing each and every store), nobody seems to offer flavored coffee.  Unless you go to a convenience store attached to a gas station (what's up with that anyway?).  Starbucks and Caribou only offer different coffees like dark or light roast.  Nothing else.  I only wished that CoffeeWorks had more than one flavored coffee available for the day.  I saw a wall of glass jars full of many, many flavors for coffee that they sell by the bag.  The coffee sizes were reasonably priced, too.  My only suggestions for them would be to (1) create a more relaxed seating area indoors other than basic tables and (2) switch to something besides the environment unfriendly styrofoam cups.  Otherwise, keep up the great work (and flavored coffees!); we'll be back!	1
We LOVE CoffeeWorks - they roast their own beans at a warehouse in Matthews and have a terrific selection of different roasts.  They also have a frequent buyers club so you can get a free lb of coffee after making x number of purchases.   Most of the people who work here are pretty educated about the various roasts and most are very helpful.\n\n2011 Update -- Sadly, this is now closed. I understand they are still roasting coffeebeans at their warehouse in Matthews. I have heard that the Ben & Jerry's in the Arbo is selling CoffeeWorks coffee.	1
I've been taking my vehicles here since 2008. No complaints. Love the shuttle service. Free coffee, coffee, & wifi if you want to wait. Friendly and proffessional staff. Clean bathrooms	1
Not the cleanest theater in the world and just as expensive as anywhere else but it does the trick.  And I'm really starting to like it because I feel like I'm traveling back in time when I pull into the parking lot and see the sign.  It's got that Edward Scissorhands Publix mojo.	1
Park Terrace is a great 6 screen located in Dilworth.  It's immense charm makes up for the fact that it is slightly outdated and still pricey at $10.  There are a host of other great things about Park Terrace:\n\n- Shows high quality movies\n- Great location\n- Stadium seating\n- Vintagey sign\n- Not a madhouse\n\nThoroughly enjoyable!	1
Love that this theater plays more than your average blockbuster.  Its my usual weekend matinee spot to see the newest random movie out.  I'm a sucker for indie films and besides the Manor this is the only place to see them.  \nNice staff, no issues, I dig it	1
I've driven by this theatre hundreds of times since I've lived in Charlotte and have never made it in until recently. These guys show tons of indie films and are one of the few in town that get their hands on some of the good ones. This is one of Regal's Theatres licensed to play Indie films. There aren't many across the country. Well, at least it pales in comparison to the USA's collection of mainstream theatres. \n\nWe showed up for a matinee on a Saturday afternoon and the crowds weren't thick at all. A few other couples waiting to purchase tickets outside. \n\nThe interior has a very welcoming old-timey feel to it. Remember theatres in the 90's? Not much glitz and glamor. Just a simple refreshment stand, a few restrooms, old tube televisions playing previews and some movie posters lining the walls. \n\nThe theatres themselves are quaint. Stadium seating, comfy chairs, ample leg room and oversized cup holders. Per usual. \n\nThe service is so nice here. The management wear suits and greet everyone as they enter. A gesture you don't find at large theatres. \n\nThis place has my vote! Cheers, Park Terrace!	1
Now, this theater is not a place you go to watch 'The Fast and the Furious XII' in 4D. It's an old-school 6-screen movie theater, where some of the screens have about 30 seats and smell pretty old. It does have stadium seating, it doesn't have an arcade.\n\nPark Terrace runs independent and foreign films and has a certain charm that is lacking in most theaters in this region (Manor Twin excepted). Like the Manor Twin it is owned by the biggest of movie theater chains, Regal, but it looks much like it has since it opened.\n\nMy wife and I have been to about 30 movies here, and have never been disappointed with the service. The food isn't the best, there aren't many options, but sometimes the popcorn is pretty good.\n\nInstead of getting a snack here, we go to the great Good Food on Montford down the road for dinner. Other times we go to Flying Biscuit and get a light meal.	1
Charlotte needs more theatres with limited release movies.  Right now there is the Manor Twin, and this place.   Pretty old, but since I love indie movies, it's all I have :(	1
I love this movie theater.  It's less crowded than Phillips Place or the others.  The popcorn at this theater is also better!	1
I LOVE this cinema. CHUD.com isn't the best movie website in the world but it's damn good!	1
I only go here if I have no other choice. This place is filthy and outdated. The bathrooms are yuck and this whole place should be redone! Nasty!	0
"Some of the rides here are quite carnival-ish. However, there are some good ones like \""The Borg\"". The food sucks and is WAY overpriced as is the souvenirs. The park constantly smells like garbage and on a hot summer day when you've been waiting in line for a good hour it's not a pleasant experience to bask in the stench of garbage mingled with the patrons sweat. I would probably tolerate this park much better if I didn't have to smell that. \nIt's great for kids if you don't mind spending all of your time surrounded by other's crying/screaming kids in kiddy-land or in the over-rated water park. Speaking of the water park - why is inevitable that when you finally get up to the top of the slide something breaks? This park always has something breaking mid-ride. There have been tales of people stuck on top of the Drop Zone for hours- not sure how true that is."	0
my first time at this theme park i was probably about 12 and i had the best time, i've been back since then and still had a great time! its just like six flags, has great rides, games, food and entertainment. there's lots of parking and its a great place to spend the day with the family and or friends. the water park is fun too! there's something for everyone to do and this is in my neighborhood. literally right down the street from my house so in the summer time i can entertain guests by taking them here.	1
This definitely isn't one of my favorite amusement parks.  I'm not a fan of the layout of the park, the admission price is too high, the coasters really are pretty wimpy overall, and let's face it - it's just too freakin' hot in Charlotte in the middle of summer.\n\nThe good news is that there are rarely the lengthy lines that you see at a lot of other parks, and that's about where the good news ends.  \n\nIt isn't the worst amusement park in the world, and I had fun on my first and only visit, but I know there's much, much better out there.  \n\nI certainly wouldn't make another trip.	0
Ride the Intimidator. Some say to visit the great wall of China before you die...I say tide the Intimidator.	1
Great park for family fun. They even host music festivals there which is fantastic. Something for everyone for sure!	1
Don't buy your tickets online! In fact, don't buy them at the gate either. Just stay away or you'd be greeted outside the gate of Carowinds by an evil blonde witch who somehow became a manager. Even proof of purchase isn't enough to prove that you brought the tickets, so you have to buy new tickets in front of her hideous face, just so you'll be able to enter and reenter (if you decide to leave the park and return later that same day). Staffs are disrespectful and don't want to help at all. \n\nGetting in cost an arm and a kidney. Drinks and food cost the rest of your other important body parts. \n\nLines are short and fast because the place is near empty. Most we had to wait was 10 minutes.\n\nEven so...\n\nAvoid! Go to Wet n' Wild Emerald Pointe Water Park instead!	0
Charlotte wouldn't be Charlotte without Carowinds. Many of the buildings and games have been there quite a long time. Now owned by Cedar Fair, they have added their quality touches to the place, bringing it inline with other regional and national theme parks.\n\nAs others have said, yes the parking is expensive. Yes, the food is expensive. Go to Busch Gardens, and Cedar Point and you will have the same experience.\n\nBut for entertainment, there are plenty of rides (and plenty of styles), live shows, and numerous pay-per-play midway games. There is also a concert venue, normally hosting Christian bands if that's your thing. One of the biggest attractions, though is Scarowinds at Halloween, a park-wide haunted trail for which they strengthen their workforce with several dozen seasonal actors to scare you throughout the night.\n\nAlso like others have said, if you're local, get a season pass. It's paid for itself after two visits and the rest of the season is free. Upgraded passes also include Scarowinds, priority seating on popular rides, or admission to other Cedar Fair parks around the country if you travel.\n\nMaybe because I'm a native to the area, but I can't imagine summer without Carowinds.	1
As a former employee of Cedar Point (one of the sister parks in the CedarFair Company), Carowinds does not exceed what Cedar Point has to offer.\n\nMy biggest disappointment, as Cedar Point offers their HallowWeekends in their daily passes, Carowinds has you pay an additional amount to experience the Halloweekends events (haunted houses, shows, etc).\n\nAlso, I was surprised that tax was not included in their food and beverage prices (again, after being a Cedar Point employee and working in the foods division - this surprised me).  Not sure if this is because the park resides in two different states.  Which brings me to another point.  One of my friends had bought a bottled drink early in the day and bought another one several hours later, only to find the price went up slightly due to the different taxes in SC & NC.\n\nThe only plus was that we had very limited wait times (the park was not that crowded).  The longest we had to wait for one of the coasters was around 20 minutes - and I am sure that would be longer if we came during the summer months.	0
We participated in the music festival yesterday, and so of course spent time enjoying the park.  Overall, this is a confusing park to navigate & it is desperately in need of signage!  I overheard others having the same problem.  Specific problem is the incredibly poor customer service attitude.  No one can answer a question.  We had to speak to 4 different people to enter and to buy two upgrades.  And I cannot tell you how confused they are in Cinnabon...oh my that was just ridiculous! Poor, poor customer service.  And charging more for a fast pass than the entry, that is just wrong!  I do not believe we will go again...unless the let me help them design a training program for their employees.  Wow just really bad.	0
Ok park. Some good coasters. Intimidator and nighthawk are our favorites.  A lot to do for the kids. \n\nShould have wait times listed for rides. Waited 1 hr 35 min for nighthawk. Need to improve carowinds app. \n\nStaff isn't polite or even nice for that matter. \n\nPark isn't very clean. Bathrooms are filthy and smell awful.	0
I will never go here again. Last Saturday, I paid for my ticket and headed in. Unfortunately, after waiting nearly two hours for the Nighthawk, it was put out of service, as were some others in the park that day. This has happened to me several times at Carowinds and I really don't understand how their coasters malfunction daily, sometimes multiple times. After purchasing a ticket, I literally got to ride one ride, for which I also waited over an hour. And of course their were no refunds even though it was their issue.	0
just spent the day with my husband, 10 yr old son and his friend at carowinds. I now know why tix are so cheap. (37.50 through AAA per person) add to that $15 parking, $58 for 3 nasty burgers and cold fries, 2 slices of pizza and 2 kids milks, $9.48 for 2 sprites and it adds up quickly. if you only want to ride roller coasters, then this is the place for you. no other entertainment was available while we were there. off season I guess. won't make the 3 hour drive again from Charleston. would rather drive a little further and go south to universal. much better value for money spent.	0
"It's a \""good\"" park experience. The rides were all mostly open. The food selection was average park food. Cheese burgers. Panda Express. Rita's Ice was good. 2 new restaurants that were supposed to be open were still under construction. \nThere was only 1 show open when I went cause it was early in the season. The park was mostly clean. Good amount of trees. Needs more dark rides. Cool coasters but everyone has coasters. It's also not really a theme park. It's just a good amusement park. No theming or design to take notice of. \n     But the people who work there were nice. The people who visited also seemed nice. It was a 65% positive experience. But I don't really see any reason to make a special trip as it's not really different from other cedar fair parks.\n     If you are going to visit one time. I do recommend getting the \""fast lane plus\"" option as the lines were an average of 1 hour each. Fast lane plus made everything a walk on. And front row preference on most rides."	1
As a kid I remeber fallong down an open unmarked manhole, and not getting anything save a change of clothes and a freaking lollipop, they also refused to do anymore to compensate me. This also wasn't an emptied manhole, it was nearly overflowing. I will never go back to this park since this happened, and the lack of proper response.	0
Carowinds is a wonderful amusement park and water park.  It is small enough that you can ride every ride in one day and large enough so you are never bored. Buying a Gold Season Pass is the way to go.  After 2 visits you have gotten your money's worth. Parking is free with the season pass, otherwise it is $15 each trip.  Carowinds has many trees and flowering plants everywhere.  Very easy to be in the shade when the sun gets too hot.   It is wonderful to have such a nice park here in the Carolina's!  Living close allows us to go there anytime we want, like having a theme park in our backyard!	1
If you have been to Disney or even Chi-fil-a this place will disappoint you with their horrible customer service. Perhaps when 80% of your staff are 18 yrs and younger you need to instill respect, courtesy and the customer is always right b/c they just dropped a freakin mini fortune on this crappy amusement park that post hours of operations for stores and restaurants as suggested times. And you only get 1 star because I couldn't leave it blank	0
My wife and I bought tickets online in advance to the park. We came on Halloween night for Scarowinds. Well we were here for 30 minutes before rain and lightning came. We went to guest services and they told us there are no refunds. If you plan on going to this park make sure to check the weather or kiss your $$ goodbye.	0
First off a came in and the guy didn't acknowledge me, and when he thought it was a decent time to ask me if I needed help. I told him that I called for tires cause I had a flat then, the guy said wait a minute and helped a guy who just wanted air in his tire so I waited for them to finish and he said how can I help you again and I said I would like a tire, then he asked for my keys said have. I been here before then said you can sit down now. If I wasn't form another city I wouldn't have come but I'm in a tight situation so I had to bite the bullet. Never again tho	0
I took my car here after my TPMS light came on. They found a nail in it, but also claimed my shocks were going bad 30,000 miles too soon.  However, it turned out my shocks were fine.  So these guys almost made me spend $250 for unnecessary repairs. Disgraceful.	0
In Oct. my son that is at  UNCC had a nail in his tire. The person at Tire Kingdom told him he needed 3 new tires., THe car is dented and has over 151,000 miles on it.We told him to match the tread. Instead of giving him options of prices they put on$ 184.00 tires EAC on the vehicle. I called very upset the next morning and the manger said he would not give me an exchange nor would he give me any money off. He offered a 4th tire with a $70.00 rebate and would discount an oil change! This is taking advantage of a young consumer and  in my opinion a terrible way of doing business. I would NEVER recommend this company.	0
Worst customer service ever. The manager is rude and talks bad about the client and little care for his customer	0
Worst place ever. Don't go there. Customer service was awful and they didn't even do what I asked them to, due to them trying to scam me for more business. I will never go back.	0
"We have to have electricity & you have no choice but to use Duke. :D\n\nLuckily, I've never had any major power outages, even when nasty storms rage during the spring & summer months.  And I can depend pretty much on my bill to go up during the months of December - February & again from June - August.\n\nThey're pretty much \""in the news\"" when there's going to be a rate increase, so you're never fully caught off guard.\n\nI love having the \""paperless\"" bill option. It's full of detailed information about my bills & ways to possibly cut down. However in my case, they always say I am way below the normal usage & the weather normally affects the changes. \n\nLike Nicole, I appreciate them sending out the free CFL bulbs."	1
I do not recommend going here. \n\nI was searching for an independent little place to pick up dog food. The name almost turned me off, but I decided not to be so judgmental. It was really dirty inside and the animals in cages looked upset/not taken care of. This place is the sort of place that might haunt you at night. If you are overly sensitive about animals (like me) then this is probably not the best place for you to check out.	0
It's a flea market.  Nothing more; nothing less.  It's old crap that no one should need unless you are a hoarder.  There are plenty of free flea markets and yard sales that are free.  This misadventure cost me $20 in admission fees.  What a waste.  It's $10 a head.  Finally, no one takes credit cards... even for the admission charge.  After all, flea markets and yard sales typically deal in cash only.  I now feel slightly dirty.	0
The expo itself is pretty lame - it seems like a few buildings in a field, next to the now-defunct Metrolina Speedway.  We actually went for the Home Show, which at the same price as the show held at the former Merchandise Mart, is a complete waste.\n\nYou can walk through the entire thing in a few minutes, and it's just about worthless.  Perhaps four rows of tables, and very few of them offering anything worthwhile.\n\nAs to the grounds of the expo itself?  It's like a fairgrounds.  Don't bother going if you're handicapped, because the spaces are close to the entrance, but they are also muddy if it's been raining.  Not a good mix.	0
Just had a booth at the Quilt Show this past weekend.  The service of the volunteers was excellent, parking was easy, bathrooms were well-stocked and concession food was pretty tasty. We had a great time and so happy that they scheduled the same weekend as the Bead Show!	1
The doctor prescribed me medication that I am allergic to. It was in my chart and I told her about my allergy in person. I ended up in the emergency room. The practice manager does not seem to care about the issue and their whole staff is awful.	0
Sometimes, it's just nice to get out of town for a while and still go to a familiar place. Old Navy was my spot today, riding around the Carolinas. The store was HUGE and organized...it's hard to find both these days. Everything was organized, on the right size hangers, and there was plenty of helpful staff to assist me if I needed a different size. The biggest thing I loved about this Old Navy was their dressing room procedure. They have a small marker board on each dressing room door and they write on it the number of items you take in to try on as well as your name in case someone comes looking for you. The staff was very helpful and upbeat, but not in the annoying way, in a genuinely helpful way. I would recommend this Old Navy to anyone. They definitely had something for everyone!	1
Not a real big fan of Old Navy since I guess I grew out of that phase... don't get me wrong they make respectable clothes but there are only so many ringer t-shirts one can wear in a lifetime.\n\nI recommend the clearance rack strategically located in the back of the store sections.  I guess it's pretty smart to put the regular priced stuff in front, but sometimes I feel the clearance prices are just about right for what you are getting.\n\nOther than some novelty items and the occasional good sale, I think I'll stick with my other stores for the time being.	0
Huge fan of Old Navy! Hugh fan of this location!\n\nFirst, what I like most is that they really seem to cater to trendy new styles! It's always a fresh look with lots of different colors and textures! \n\nThe reason I'm a fan of this location is that it seems to carry a huge variety of sizes and lengths! Especially for the ladies with long legs! \n\nAlso the layout is pretty cool too, you walk in to the Men's and Women's, fitting rooms are in the middle and kids in the back! But also there are so many other stores here...Target, Kohls and Bed Bath and Beyond...just to name a few! \n\nWith great prices and very nice associates I am definitely going to be back!	1
"I loathe these stores. The clothes are cheaply made. The prices aren't comaprable to the item. This is \""name brand\"" prices for crap clothing. The only reason I set foot in here is because my daughter got gift cards from relatives for Christmas. and for $50 she got a thin pair of jeans, a knit skirt and a thin black shirt. and we went over by 87 cent! OH and the jeans were on CLEARANCE for $15.99!!!! \n\nCRAP styles too, its like a clash between late 70's early 80's. DRAB DRAB DRAB.\n\nTheir shoes.................... are you kidding me? Pay less has better! and most of the time its BOGO so in the future i will sell the gift cards for cash!"	0
"The Gateway YMCA, like so many things in the Gateway area, takes all the hassle and bustle out of your workout experience. While I normally go to the Dowd YMCA because it has a full basketball court and pool, the Gateway Y is great for a quick, simply work-out at any time. \n\nThe Gateway Y has about 30 treadmills, 15 bikes, and 10 other cardio machines, all stationed in front of TVs. It also has an adequate amount of weightlifting equipment. There are two locker rooms, a stretching area, one or two \""class\"" rooms, and that's about it. And really, that's all you need. Everything's clean, everything's new and nice; it's a perfect space for a workout without too many frills--or even the added distraction of running into everyone you know in Charlotte. \n\nIt's gets kinda crowded from 5-7 pm (after work hours), but it's never too bad, and it's certainly much thinner during the morning and later evening hours. The Y offers quite a few classes, most of which are pretty awesome if that's your thing. \n\nI go because it's close and it's easy."	1
Love the Uptown area Y's...especially the Dowd. Very big, with lots of equipment on multiple levels. Even when it's busy, it's not that much of a headache to find an open machine. Every now and then, the basketball games get a little intense and the sound carries into the fitness area. Locker room is large and offers dry cleaning AND shoe shining, which I like. \n\nOf the YMCA's near Uptown, this is definitely the best and the largest. Also has the most parking available too. Very welcoming, very clean and and great place to get your sweat on!	1
This is hands down the best gym in Charlotte (sans the parking lot, of course!). I could repeat what all other Yelpers have said about the amenities, classes, amount of weights/equipment, but I think the best part about this YMCA is the staff. Always cheerful and attentive, they really make you feel comfortable and encouraged when you walk through the doors. That's something that a person like me (aka I will NEVER EVER EVER love going to the gym) really appreciates and finds helpful in sticking to my 4 days a week program!\n\nAnother plus is no kids - after coming from the Morrison YMCA in Ballantyne, it's really nice not to have to dodge screaming little ones in the hall or wait for some 14 year old who improperly uses equipment to get done so I can work out!\n\nPrice wise it's higher than other gyms, but you always get what you pay for and they offer Financial Aid to those who need it!	1
Yes I am also a gym snob.....I love Dowd hands down compared to Uptown, Johnston, and Gateway.  If you know when to go you wont have trouble parking, there is a lot of parking behind the building too.  The treadmills with the no time cutoff and tvs are my favorite.  Last resort if the place is totally full are the treadmills upstairs.  There is a huge variety of machines, old school and the newer ones that are easier on your joints.  The thing I love about this gym is that the majority of folks that go here are pretty consistently conscious about the machines' cleanliness.\n\nI wish that they would get on the ball and start tweeting - especially when we had the snow/ice delays last week!  Grrr!!!	1
Crime is a problem!  I had my phone and keys stolen from me while I was in the pool at Dowd.  My babysitter had her car broken into in the Dowd parking lot as well. Both of these events took place within the last 2 months.  It is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe.	0
Lets see, what am I in the mood for tonight? So many options! I think I'll start with a run. Oops, all the treadmills are occupied. No problem, I'll just do the stair-stepper. Oops, occupied. Alright, hmmm, then I'll hit some nautilus equipment. Nope, all machines are busy except for the toe-raiser thing and my calves are already bulging, thank you. Ride a bike then? Nope. Play basketball? Do sit-ups on the mats? Lift free weights? Nope. Nope. Nope. Free weight room literally dangerously crowded. Fine, I'll just swim then. No lanes available. I give up.\n\nThe best workout this gym provides is the walk back and forth from your car, parked 8 blocks away because the parking lot was full.	0
I used to work out at Dowd way back when I had more time.  At that time, I really enjoyed the racquetball court and I would typically have it to myself (trying to perfect my old handball skills).  On this visit, I was there for a seminar.  I had to find my own way upstairs via the elevator to the room.  There were no signs and no one available to assist me.  Otherwise, the entryway was clean and had an open feeling.  The parking lot was full, so I gather there were many people already using the facility.  This parking lot is always full, which is a good thing for the Y.	1
Been here for ages - huge YMCA with a lot of activities going on. Classes are packed but very high level instructors. Equipment is top of the line. Social scene is pretty good. Basketball games are intense and a good mix of diversity. \n\nBiggest downside is the general amount of people that go and the parking situation. Parking can be a nightmare in peak time and it gets EXTREMELY crowded. \n\nTip: If you can go at non peak time (lunch, 5-7 PM), do it, it's almost always worth it.	1
This ymca is very large.  It has 4 floors to exercise.  Like 10 racket ball rooms.  Towel and rags are ease of access to shower and etc.  The downside is that most hours of the day it is crowded because it is located downtown.	1
I still love this place, but the hours aren't great on the weekend. \n\nAlso, the music they play in the main weight room sounds like the Disney Channel and Taylor Swift had an illegitimate child after many nights of sordid rendezvous. \n\nI don't wanna listen to that shit while I'm lifting; I wanna get pumped up!\n\nThey could take a hint from 24 Hour Fitness (which usually plays some pretty bad-ass house music)... or even the music their own group exercise classes play upstairs.	1
"Heard Boy George singing \""do you really want to hurt me?\""@the weight room, today. How could the music be more appropriate?\nBeen going here since the eighties. \nWonderful Midcentury landmark building with updated interior. \nOnly drawback to this busy location is the lack of orientation people have while navigating the building. I need to stick my hand out beyond any blind corner to keep from being run over. \nFriendly staff but I'm not usually there to talk to them. \nMen's locker room/shower is sometimes like a family reunion for 3rd world countries\nThey just need a few signs demanding that people walk on the right and stop with the drama and discussions in stairwells and corridors     \nHope I didn't insult anyone. It's one of the great old institutions of Charlotte"	1
Would not recommend, free weight room is inadequate for the amount of members. Only 2 squat racks and very low ceilings make it seem even more packed than it is. Serviceable gym during non-peak hours but I would suggest finding another place to work out if you are really in to weight lifting.	0
Blue features mediterranean style food and offers some unique options that I've not had before. The menu is pricey. Beautiful decor with a nice bar and jazz band playing. The dining room is very nice and feels like it should be pricey.\n\nWe've had great service every time we've been. The wait staff is helpful, knows the menu very well and has had some solid recommendations. The downside to Blue is that the food doesn't necessarily live up to the surroundings and the prices. I had the kobe beef on one occasion, which was very pricey, and found it to be absolutely awful. I've tried other more unique dishes like their Lamb Tagine which is slow cooked from 5am in the morning until served. I expected lots of great flavors and it was simply okay. My friend enjoyed the wild boar very much. My wife was very happy with the salmon. So the place can be great, it just depends on if you hit the right entree. We'll keep it on the list and hopefully they'll be more consistent.	1
Got to eat here for free so have no idea how much the food costs. But it was good. Had the...honestly I don't remember what I had to eat here. By the time I had gotten my entree, we had been drinking a lot of wonderful red wine. They wine selection was pretty good for the South. Sorry that's the California wine snob in me talking. The appetizers were wonderful, some kind of mini pizza bread, hummus plate, calamari, etc. Yummy. The service was good. Even the manager pitched in to help us. We were a very large party. Probably around 30. They had live music which was really good and the crowd was cool. If I end up in Charlotte again, I'd go here for more.	1
Pricey and just mediocre in service, food quality and atmosphere. Went on Sunday, January 31, the last evening of the Dining Out Charlotte special event, dinner for $30.  Two couples, we brought our own wine, and bill still came to $100 per couple. And the three others with me all had the Ragout dish and ALL three were sick to their stomachs throughout that night into the next evening. There are way better restaurants in Charlotte for the price.  Footnote -- the restaurant was nearly empty due to the weather.  You would think the manager would have come by the table to ask us about our dining experience.  He or she never appeared...do they even care?	0
Very RUDE management- we had to wait over an HOUR to get our car out of valet while we watched people leave left and right...we mentioned this to several people - we were offered many excuses to find out in the end that they completely misplaced our CAR! I would have been satisfied if they had offered us a drink- our table spent over $200 on our dinner- we didn't even get an apology...I wrote a letter and everything!\n\nThe waitstaff was friendly- the meal was ok - nothing special considering Charlotte has plenty of great restaurants . Restaurants have a lot to do with relationships- and they killed mine with this one.  Bottom line the food wasn't THAT good to warrant my return...	0
Very curteous service but could not make up for a compltely lackluster dinner. Ordered the rib eye special with herbed gnocci and broccoli rabe. Steak was bland, gnocci was dry and lacked any flavor while broccoli rabe was over salted. Sticky toffee pudding for dessert was too sweet. This was my third and last meal there - three strikes and you are OUT! This CA girl knows better.	0
I loved this place the first time, but I went back for Restaurant Week, and was incredibly disappointed.\n\nFisherman's Daughter Wild Shrimp and Cucumber Salad - NOTE: This is NOT a salad. It's 4 cocktail shrimp with sweetened tomato sauce and a shreds of cucumbers. Bleh.\n\nProsciutto Flat Bread - Had a really stinky fontina cheese and I felt the sage was too pungent. Also, I didn't like the quality of the flatbread.\n\nAlaskan Halibut with a Lobster Succotash - Most flavorless halibut I have ever had. Lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless! I added a boatload of salt, so it was somewhat bearable. \n\nThe Cake di Chocolate is standard lava cake (takes forever to make).\nThe Pecan Pie was HUGE. \nThe Sticky Toffee Pudding was very butterscotchy. \n\nOverall? Not a fan.\n\nMaybe if I come back next time I'll have better luck?	0
it was ok.  \n\nmussels were good.  service ok.  ambiance seemed dated.  worth a trip, but not sure i would go back.	0
This Mickey Mouse operation has been relentlessly spamming me for months.  I AM IN BOSTON, not Charlotte.  I would never patronize a place like this.  \n\nIf you do, be cautious -- DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR EMAIL.	0
Thumbs up, great wine selection and atmosphere.  Must try the Scallops. \nWent during Charlotte Restaurant Week.  They accommodated a group of ten.	1
"It pains me to say after Blue was my favorite restaurant for yeeeeears but spending 12 hours sick as a dog without  them doing a thing about it has forced me too.\nOn Dec 18 2010 we sprang for an overnight sitter, got a room at the Omni, and a reservation at Blue (our favorite restaurant)  By the time dinner was over I needed to use the restroom and after that barely made it back to the Omni where I spent the rest of the night on the toilet.  I have eaten food from street vendors in Asia, Africa, and Mexico and have NEVER had a problem; yes I have intestines of steel.\nI called Blue the next day to warn them if nothing else and was told \""the chef is off but I will let him know\""  I never heard another thing.  I wasn't looking for a million dollars, but I spent $400 for a romantic evening on the john.  \nMistakes happen, I am just disappointed in Blues lack of response or concern for a loyal customer."	0
Saw some mixed reviews on Yelp, but I wanted nice food and live music.  I don't know if we just hit them on a good day, but everything was just about perfect for us.\n\nThe calamari with fried grapes and olives was super.  The scallop appetizer was even better.\n\nI adored my tenderloin entree, ad the desert was the best part of the evening.	1
My boyfriend and I have eaten here a few times, and so far, we have been very pleased with the service and quality of food.  They have a great wine selection as well.   It is not a place to go on the cheap though, so be prepared to spend a little cash.  \n\nWe stopped in on Friday evening to meet a friend for beverages and there was a blues band playing.  Alex Myrick (the owner) actually got up and sang with the band and played harmonica. He was great! \n\nI would definitely recommend Blue for a nice dinner or as a cool place to stop in for bevvies and appetizers.	1
I went here for my birthday and it was a very lovely dinner. There was a jazz band playing which gave the place a good atmosphere. It's classy and a perfect celebration or romantic dinner spot. It is pricey though so plan to spend a pretty penny. My husband and I shared the Flatbread and the Scallops and for dinner i had the Beef Tenderloin and he got the Duo of Wild Boar. The food was fabulous! Juicy and very flavorful. Every dish was presented beautifully and tasted as good as it looked. I was very happy and reallllly full by the end of the night. If you have the money or a special occasion to celebrate do it at Blue, you won't be disappointed!	1
Highly accommodating for allergies and food preferences. Good service, quality food and robust drink/wine menu. Would definitely go again.	1
We went here for New Year Eve. This was our second time at Blue and it was just as good as the first time. Impeccable service. Energetic and Chic Ambiance. The Lemon Drop Martini was so good that I had two and I have been known to send it back to the bar if it is not made right.\n\nMy Butternut Squash was rich, perfectly spices with the right amount of creamy taste. My Pan Roasted Grouper was cooked just right and very fresh but I wasn't overly crazy about how it was spiced. \n\nWe capped the night by sharing a piece of Chocolate cake and it was delicious..	1
I liked my meal here.  Good solid food, but not really anything earth shattering or innovative.  We had the crab cakes, scallops (which were EXCELLENT)  and striped bass which was good.  They really shine in the dessert area though, the bread pudding Brioche was absolutely fabulous.  Service was very attentive.  The crowd was a little weird, there were super casual people and very dressed up people.  The cocktails were excellent, overall it was good but not anything that I am dying to go back for.	1
Gorgeous restaurant...the ambiance is great...very unique and tasty cuisine, and there was (at least when we were there) a trio of custards dessert that was IN-SANE!  A great meal...but it is DEFINITELY pricey...go for a special occasion, but DO go!	1
The food was literally inedible. We had calimari as our app & it was very yummy. We were excited about our entrees based on this course. My husband ordered the shrimp gnocchi dish. It tasted like orange peels-even the shrimp. There was a pesto sauce & orange rinds in the dish, which we thought was an interesting combo. I never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life. Nothing had any other taste except orange zest. I had the duck, which was okay. Nothing to write home about. The duck was really rough & fatty. Came with a side of asparagus & rice. The veggies & rice were okay. I preferred them over the duck. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake to split. We didn't even finish it. Would definitely NEVER go back	0
Had dinner at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Colleen the bartender advised me on the meal and Mike the bartender talked soccer and hoops.  First they served me home baked bread with a delicious spread that was a meal by itself, then I had the poached pear gorgonzola salad which was light, tasty and satisfying.  Then Colleen advised the wild Boar.  What a treat!! delicious and came with a risotto that was amazing.  Topped off with a wild blueberry sauce.  Portion was huge and I could not finish it but I wish I could have.  I ended with the molten chocoloate cake with vanilla ice cream.  15 minutes to prepare Colleen had warned me, but 3 minutes to eat.  Super meal, wont forget it.  If you have a face and a mouth and can chew food, you will surely love Blue!!	1
I surprised my wife with a visit to Blue the other night and as usual we were impressed. We only live a mile or two away and we try to keep Blue in our rotation and get there every few months. \n\nI am always impressed with the quality and presentation of the food and beverages. We started with the Pineapple Upside Down Martini, what an amazing cocktail. \n\nAs an appetizer we each had the Scallops, I could have eaten five orders as they were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. We also shared a nice selection of cheeses as well and all were absolutely wonderful.\n\nFor dinner my wife had the scallop, even though we had it as an appetizer she wanted more and the dish did not disappoint. I went with the tenderloin, topped with blue cheese and served atop a sweet pea risotto. What an outstanding dish and it was also perfectly cooked. \n\nOur server Juan was awesome, very accommodating, efficient and gave great suggestions. Juan is an extremely nice server. He made us feel like we were the most important people in the restaurant. \n\nGreat Job BLUE.	1
Blue is a goodplace to take friends and family from out of town, also great for a romantic date. The decor and interior is swanky, and the staff are super friendly. It's a little pricey, but they have food options that are interesting enough to justify the price. \n\nWhen I was there, I had a dish that consisted of two different cuts of wild boar in a currant and wine sauce. It was incredible. nom nom nom.	1
Wonderful!  The service and food were spot on.  Try the scallops appetizer and save room for dessert.	1
Went there while visiting Charlotte.  Found the place cold, thermally and ambiance.  Waiter tried, but a bit too chatty and played up the food preparations a little too much.  Not impressed.  Sorry we picked it after reading rave reviews online.  Wouldn't go back.	0
"I didnt see anything spectacular about this place.   All I kept hearing about this place is the food, ambiance, and how its rank among the best in the country.   I'm more interested in the quality of the food than with all the glossy adjectives when describing the menu and service.  The bottom line is that I felt I donated $100 just to say \""I been there\"" for food that was average."	0
We stopped here to share three appetizers after sharing three appetizers at BlackFinn.  What a mistake!  The lobster crab cakes were one bite, if that and its questionable if there was actually lobster and crab in there.  We also had two Scallops wrapped in prosciutto, saut\u00e9ed crisp and served over a fava bean puree, topped with\nlemon marmalade which were just mediocre, and 3 Risotto balls which were stuffed with pancetta, sweet onions and mozzarella fried crispy and served\nwith a rich tomato sauce.   What a disappointment, the risotto balls were very bland and gummy.  The only good thing was the Lemon Drop Martini.  We should have eaten more at BlackFinn, we will know for our next trip.	0
Mother's Dy Brunch- 3 adults and 1 child - 180.00 - only drinks were 2 waters and 2 teas-  gratuity was included in bill - so service was barely passable.  Food was okay - but not worth the price charged.  However - the crepes were awesome - the saving grace.  The entertainment was good and the atmosphere fine.  Probably would NOT go back.  Don't see a good value.  Do not recommend.	0
My wife and I always enjoy our meals at Blue. We had one of her birthday dinners, a new year's eve dinner, some get-together with colleagues, and it was a good experience every time. The food is great and so is the service.	1
Went for a girls night for restaurant week. I was feeling crazy so let the waiter pick my meal from the options. He was blah.. All the staff seemed overworked and very tired. The jazz band was the only thing buzzing. He picked the risotto balls they were okay, kinda bland. Then he picked the hanger steak since most everyone at the table got the swordfish. It was cooked rare in he middle which I normally love. I love a good steak. This was not a good steak. Very tough and minimal flavor. Veg casserole was good. The dessert was okay. Had the lemon and blueberry thing. The cookie was TERRIBLE! Like a unflavored overlooked piece of cornbread. What were they thinking. Even our weighted laughed and said yeah it's more for decoration than taste. It was gross.  Don't think I will be back. Disappointed in my queens feast choice. Wish I could go back and choose again. I'm a foodie and disappointed.	0
The Wild Boar entree was a winner.\nService was great and waiter was very attentive.	1
Disappointed doesn't begin to explain. I now spent $350 on a bridesmaid dress that will never be worn. It is the wrong size, they won't alter it. They will do nothing and now I do not have a dress to wear at a wedding that is 2 1/2 weeks away. \nHailey the assistant manager is clueless and unhelpful. She knew nothing about the dress which is why it is wrong. So I thought maybe the manager Hannah would help. NOPE. Nothing. They even made the bride call the manufacturer herself, talk about poor customer service.\nI would NEVER recommend Nitsa's. I would even give it one star.	0
Totally disappointed in the service at this bridal boutique! Nobody would help us and they were eating in the back. Very snobby would NEVER recommend this boutique to any bride! The store was empty and they acted like they had no time for us!	0
I was stoked to try this place for lunch today. I just found out about it last week. Who knew this little gem was located Uptown? Ok, I guess people who work on that side of Uptown but I never knew it was there! Quick service but it took awhile to get our check. Luckily, one of the girls I was with knew the manager and she alleviated the issue. I love that they have sushi specials that come with soup or salad at a reasonable price. The sushi tasted fresh and the spicy tuna had my mouth burning which is a great thing. Their portions for lunch on the hot dishes looked ginormous so I will be checking that out next. In and out in less than an hour-good times. Two words for you Fujo---Sushi Buffet!!!	1
Owner was extremely polite.  Waitress was not the best.  Brought me the wrong beer and the wrong sushi (even after a lengthy explanation that I wanted salmon roe...not salmon or a salmon roll).  The sushi itself was ok but not as good as I would expect from an Uptown establishment.	0
This is the first time I've been here.  First of all the Singapore Noodles was the best I have ever tasted in my life and I've had several.  The waitress was great.  The bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away.  I don't mind saying I may eat here again tomorrow!	1
Yum! Maybe not the easiest to find tucked inside a Wells Fargo building. Well worth it once you get in. Prices are pretty good. \n\nWhat you get for the money: great sushi and great Japanese. They do not cook at the table. This is better quality. The veggies were cooked perfect. \n\nOn this visit, I had the garlic beef. Yum and be sure to grab a mint if you're on your way back to the office. Ask for your sauces like hot sauce or duck sauce. It is not on the table, but they have.\n\nThe service was great. I got drink refills without asking and they generally left us alone so we could talk. Perfect.	1
You know what's crazy? I've been to this sushi joint like at least 20 times and this is the first time I've actually checked in. I gotta step my game up. \n\nAnyhow... Godzilla Sushi Roll is the truth! You can't go wrong, ordering that. I'm seriously stuffed after eating. I mean, the crunchy tempura outside, the savory sauce, the fresh avocado... The ingredients make love in my mouth. Seriously. In my opinion, there's no need to try anything else.\n\nService is spot on. Every time I'm there, everyone is very attentive, and you can't beat the area. I always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when it's nice and warm out; eating outside just makes it all worthwhile. Even if I have to put quarters in the joint to park on a weekday. It's worth it! \n\nI go hard for some sushi, especially the Godzilla roll. Get on it!	1
I bought a couple of Groupons for this place once I saw the reviews. Verdict: delicioso. In fact, it might be the best sushi place I've been to in Charlotte, competing with my evergreen love for Cowfish.\n\nI took the recommendations of others and opted for the Godzilla Roll. Absolutely freaking delicious; 10/10. The tempura was divine, as was the sauce, as was the filling. All of it. Their fried pork dumplings were tasty too - I prefer mine to be crunchier than the ones they served, but they were delightfully flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the Classic Spicy Eel and Spicy Yellowtail rolls. I thought they seemed a bit skimpy on the rice and not spicy at all, but the fish and eel themselves were tender and plentiful. The food did come out quickly, so we were pleased with that. And the hot sake was pretty good, even though I don't like sake all that much.\n\nReally my only [minor] complaint was the service. The manager (I assume) was quite nice, but our server was not very attentive. It was enough to knock off one star, but not enough to keep me from going back.	1
Nice employees, nice location, Awful sushi.  Should have known something was amiss when it was empty at 6:30 on a Friday night.  Surely there are better places in town.	0
We tried Fujo for the last time. We never know if they are delivering. It changes by the day. When they do deliver, it always takes longer than the estimated time. We have had to cancel our order before because drivers were extremely late. Today, we were disappointed with the food we relieved. It was BLAND! There was no flavor at all. I can't say enough how upset I am with the lack of consistency this restaurant has. We'll take our business somewhere else.	0
Having limited options in Uptown I gave this place a few chances.  It's just not good.  I got some eel that wasn't fresh and I haven't been able to eat eel since.  I also think their miso soup is actually chicken broth with some miso tossed in.	0
I want to preface this by letting you know  that I am not picky about my sushi. But, unfortunately, I had the worst sushi I've ever had at Fujo. \n\nWe split a salmon roll, a spicy tuna roll and a Godzilla roll. The salmon was too tough to be chewed. The spicy tuna roll had tempura flakes on the outside that tasted horribly stale and like they'd been cooked in extremely rancid oil. The Godzilla roll was yummy but not amazing - it was the most redeeming part of the meal for sure though. We also tried the sesame tofu and it was a huge disappointment - the tofu was so hard it was difficult to chew and it came with almost no veggies (4 tiny broccoli florets don't count). Our server was friendly and attentive and that's what's keeping this review from being a lower one. I didn't send anything back or complain to the server because it was a week night, we were tired, and we knew we wouldn't be back again. \n\nAll in all, it was def not my best groupon date night. Live and learn!	0
1 star for price and 1 star for atmosphere; however, terrible service and run-of-the-mill food\n\nTook forever to have our order taken followed by them not bringing my food out after everyone had already gotten their order. Never came by to fill our glasses. The food came out in a messed up order. Appetizers got there only 2 minutes before main course, seriously? Once I got my sushi I had no tray for the soy sauce and no one was around to ask for one. The kicker, the place wasn't busy, not in the least bit.\n\nI will never return here when I come back to Charlotte.	0
"Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon, that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it, and the manager told us, \""you have two choices, ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it.\"" If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him, but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food."	0
I had high expectations for this place, given that it came highly recommended by 2 work associates. Service was quick and attentive....even though I was the first to order and had to wait about 5 extra minutes AFTER everyone else got their order.....Strike 1.\n\nI got the Malay Sauce dish with chicken and shrimp. They give you LOTS of fried rice (or any rice you order) which makes the plate look deceivingly large, but in reality it is NOT that big of a portion....whic is OK for lunch. But the chicken and shrimp portions were unusually SMALL (i.e., not that much of it) and they were definitely skimpy on the Malay Sauce. Strike 2.\n\nThe flavors were.....somewhat BLAND. Not bad, but compared to something like Hasaki Grill, they just cannot compete. Strike 3.\n\nNot horrible but given the Uptown choices (Room 112, Hasaki, Enzo, etc.) there are FAR better choices than Fujo.	0
This a great place for a quick lunch in uptown Charlotte.  The service is always exceptional and the food is very good.  I normally order the tangerine or general tso chicken.  It's delicious with the right amount of heat.  I definitely recommend Fujos for lunch.	1
Lunched here on a recent visit.  Decent sushi.  Lots of tables, but very busy.  Tables turned fairly quickly.  Wait staff seemed to encourage that, but did a decent job of not being pushy.\n\nMy rolls were decent - can't remember which ones I went with.  One had jalapenos - not exactly Asian, but muy caliente ... and muy bueno.  Two rolls made for a good lunch.\n\nThey do have other non-sushi dishes.  The other guy at lunch had soup and dumplings.  Looked decent.  He seemed to enjoy his selection.	1
Decent sushi place in Uptown. I believe they are more crowded for lunch cause we went here for dinner and it was completely dead.\n\nWent to Fujo on Friday night for dinner cause we had a Groupon. The place was very empty and we decided to sit outside since it was nice out! The outside basically looks out onto a huge fountain, so it was nice. \n\nOrdered a couple of bottled beers. They dont have any draft beers and their bottle selections werent really that great.\n\nWe got the steamed dumplings as an appetizer and split 3 rolls: Godzilla, Sunset, and the Charlotte Delight Roll. All three were very good. The Sunset roll was my favorite cause I loved that garlic sauce on top. The Godzilla roll was my husbands favorite.....though, I thought it was just too much going on! I thought everything was well priced (all three rolls under $10 each) and we will definitely return for a casual dinner date.	1
I would highly recommend Foundation for the Carolinas for an uptown wedding in Charlotte, NC.  My husband and I got married there in August 2014. \n\nWe were able to comfortably use this space for our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception for 107 guests.  The 4th floor space we used was newly renovated, and with good weather you can utilize the patio spaces, which have awesome views of the city, including the changing color Duke Energy building.  \n\nWe are starting to get back our professional photos and the venue photographed beautifully; it was the perfect backdrop, in fact we chose to do our sneak peak in the 1st floor gallery space.  \n\nWe really enjoyed working with the staff, Rebecca and David, and loved this venue's uptown location.  It is a block and a half from Holiday Inn Center City and across the street from The Dunhill.  It was very accessible for our out-of-town guests to stay uptown and walk to all of the weekend wedding celebrations.\n\nhttp://evergreenstudio1.com/blog/?p=3960	1
CPCC provides a great learning environment for students of all ages. Registration can be a hassle and occasionally slow, and classes go really fast so don't procrastinate when registration opens. Smaller classrooms provide a more interactive learning environment and there is plenty of free tutoring for various courses. If you're plan on transferring I would suggest meeting with a program advisor from both CPCC and the school you're transferring to so there's no confusion on what classes you need. The bookstore can be relatively expensive so I would recommend shopping around before buying any textbook through CPCC. If you're looking to get involved there's student government, community outreach programs, and community service programs at your disposal. I strongly recommend the hospitality and culinary program for anyone interested in those fields.	1
I gave one star because you can't give none!! The manager, Mary Figerarro was mean to me, she yelled at me and told me I was wrong because I wanted a sandwich that was cooked!! And continued to show her attitude problem about me having a different opinion about how done the roast should be cooked!!!!  I asked for a refund and she yelled at me again because I took my receipt!!!  She is a raging witch!!!	0
I just want to say that for a fast good restaurant the customer service is excellent. The food is always ok (but I don't expect if to be wonderful for $7). I went Monday 12/10 and the young man working the drive thru window was very pleasant. Asked if here was anything else I needed and had a friendly demeanor. I would go back to a place like Arbys to be treated with respect before I went to a different fast food restaurant! Good Customer service always makes you come back!	1
I had one of those nights where I was hungry for something but didn't know what and that's just the worst. I was driving around and saw this place out of the corner of my eye and took a chance on it. I got the Jerk Chicken Small Plate and was reasonably priced for the amt of food you get (chicken, rice and cabbage). Chicken was very succulent, flavorful and fell right off the bone. Order was up in the less than two minutes and was a quick transaction. Very quaint with the menu on a chalkboard inside.	1
"\""Meh. I've experienced better\"". Don't go for the jerk chicken. It looked like brownstew, and It just wasn't that good. The greens were okay. I would try something else...IF I go back. Also the lady at the register was holding a personal conversation on the phone while I placed my order and waited to get my food. What's up with that?"	0
This is my new favorite place. Love love the jerk chicken and collard greens. The curry was really good too, and the cabbage. I had a taste of the salted fish, which I wasn't a fan of, mainly b/c it was fried, but the rice and peas, I enjoyed as well.\n\nHighly recommended hole in the wall for take-out foodies.	1
I had some clothes dry cleaned here a few days ago.  The turn around was a day, which was awesome, but my favorite sweater feels hard and scratchy now and looks a little pilled.  I think they messed it up - can't be sure since it was the first time I took it to the cleaners but I'm not going back.  The cost for pants was about $6 and about $3 for sweaters...	0
"Love 2001 Cleaners. I only have a few items that need to be dry cleaned, but these guys always do the job. \n\nPretty standard, really. Come in, drop off your stuff and come back next day to pick it up. Always done with a smile and you can't really go wrong. \n\nHere's a tip: Drop off your stuff on Wednesdays. 25% off and you can drop off anytime during the day. Pretty darn good deal.\n\nThese guys and gals are always friendly and helpful. Also, their seamstress is very nice. She fixed a pair of linen slacks that I have (Who says \""linen slacks in a Yelp review anyways?) and did a great job. \n\nGreat job, 2001. Keep truckin'."	1
The woman at the counter gave my daughter the stink face when we tried to drop off several items for cleaning. \n\nShe was rude the entire time, huffing when I asked how long the service would take. \n\nWe took the clothes back and left, will find somewhere that appreciates the customers a little more.	0
I got stuck at the train tracks fo like an hour, so I pulled into this lovely little garden. Actually, it's surprisingly big. \n\nWalk through the gallery and check out local artwork (mostly botanical subjects of course), then go out the back, which opens up to mirrored ornaments dangling from Willow trees, sculpture gardens, and, of course, roses.  Lots and lots of roses.\n\nMcGill is perfect for a picnic, a stroll with that special someone, a place to take kids, and especially for refuge from that awful train!	1
Charlotte's hidden gem located near NoDa. Stop in and see Karisa, owner of Nectar florist. The history of the garden is amazing. It feels like you have stepped out of Charlotte and into a fairytale. I had my wedding there and I highly recommend it to everyone else too. Open minded to everyone and all ages. If you are from out of town, go here. Take a camera. Art, flowers, train car, its gorgeous. Their events are so much fun too. Mothers day always has something sweet going on.\nGo see this special place.	1
Prepare for your mind to be blown. This is one of Charlotte's best secrets.\n\nIt is on N. Davidson in an industrial/sketch area. You walk into this STUNNING garden with plenty of art. It is a delight. You feel like you are transformed into a new place. I cannot recommend this place enough. It feels magical. There are little paths that you can walk to with privacy. There is a large area to be in with a big group. We went for a rehearsal dinner and it was breath taking. \n\nI highly recommend going here.	1
I was feeling the need for a snack the other day and happened to be in the area of this little gem.  So I popped over to see what they had to offer, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The smell of fresh baked bread and other goodies meets you at the door, which is always fun.\n\nBesides the inviting smells, the employees are super nice.  Even though all I bought was a cookie they offered me a free taste of one of their other products (btw the pecan sweet bread is awesome).  Plus I liked the open layout of the place.  You can watch as they pull the bread out of the oven and wrap it up for you.	1
This is such a sweet little place.  It feels a bit like stepping back in time. The employees are so friendly, and they are happy to give samples.  They do sell out sometimes, so the selection can be rather slim if you get there later in the day. My son loves the cinnamon bread - I use it for his peanut butter sandwiches and it is his favorite!	1
If you know of better cinnamon rolls in Charlotte, let me know. They are great here.	1
Great venue for a wedding - I attended a couple of weddings here and the chapel is very quaint.  If you like historic little places with lots of character and don't want to get married in an actual church, this is a great option. It is also centrally located between midtown & uptown districts, which is nice if you have people coming from out of town or simply from different sides of town. There is a beautiful garden outdoors with lots of trees and a sweet little gazebo which is perfect for those wedding photos.	1
"While I hate nailing a place that has so few reviews, I'm afraid I have to give this place one star.  Some of you might say, \""well, what did you expect from a strip mall Chinese joint?\""  Well, some of the best Chinese food on the West Coast is in a strip mall or even in a bad part of town.  Sadly, this restaurant is not only shabby inside and out, but their food is just as shabby.\n\nTheir sauces taste bottled with a one-size fits all sort of technique:  pile on thick, gunky brown sauce on everything and call it Chinese.  Plates that are old and worn.  Dirty glasses.  Shelves that appeared thick with dust.  A faded \""Best of Charlotte\"" frame on the wall that dates back to many years ago. \n\nIt's sad to see a small business that just doesn't get it.  The food here falls short of the worst  Chinese food in a mall food court. That says it all."	0
Given this place a few tries. The staff is always super nice, but the food is a bit lack luster. The sauce does taste like it comes from a can and the crab Rangoon was chewy and soft like it had just been thawed out. \n I ordered sesame chicken and I had two pieces before I discovered the long black hair going all through the dish. I was finished after that. This place is ok but I wish they would clean it up just a bit and take more care with how they prepare food. This was the last time I'll be here.	0
Quick, decent nothing amazing. the fried rice was good and egg drop soup decent. if you're looking just to crave a Chinese craving it works.	0
If I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered the generals chicken because you really can't mess that up. This place did. The red sauce that covered it was so sugary and gross that it tasted like it came from a can.  There was definitely not any white meat in my dish--only chewy fatty tissue that had some dark meat attached to it. The side of fried rice tasted fine but it didn't have any of the usual carrots or peas in it so it lacked in flavor. I have yet to find a really good Chinese take out in Charlotte.	0
Very dirty and disgusting. Sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce. Long black hair right on top. Got up and walked out.	0
I wish zero stars were an option. I placed a delivery order and was told it would take 30-45 minutes to arrive. After waiting for 90 minutes and placing three calls to the store, my food arrived. When opening the bag, I had a feeling this food wasn't worth the wait. My beef/broccoli was chewy, cold, and unappetizing. I ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash. Do not eat at place and whatever you do, don't get their takeout service. Go to Tapei Express on Providence for great Chinese takeout.	0
This place is close to my office which is convenient.  I have eaten take out from here at least 10 times and have yet to be disappointing.  I don't expect a whole lot from a Asian take out place.  Consistent food quality, clean, and most important to me for judging Chinese food is a fresh cooked egg roll.  There is no reason to precook them and let them stew in their own grease.  I have yet to have an experience to not come back here.	1
We used to go to the Emperor years ago with our young children and had fond memories of the place.  It was a mom & pop shop, nice ambiance and friendly service at good prices. \n\nAfter some shopping at the Metropolitan my husband wanted to go to the Emperor for a quick dinner.  There were no other diners in the restaurant.  Evidently this place is now pretty much a take-out joint, maybe has some lunch business, but is not longer a place to enjoy a sit down meal. We were gruffly greeted by the sole person at the desk, brought over some fried noodles and duck sauce while we considered the menu.  \n\nWe ordered the Szechuan Shrimp and Scallops and also the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce.  I will say that the food was plentiful and not bad, but I will never go back.  The place appears dirty, the service is not friendly.  Never asked if we needed or wanted anything else.  Didn't seem to care about having sit-down customers at all.  Just a bad experience all around.  Gross.	0
This place is failing in every way: their service is dismal, their food is greasy/tasteless/disgusting, and the kitchen/dining room are absolutely filthy. I have no idea how or why they continue to remain in business, but I would suggest that if you ever must make the mistake of consuming this disgusting excuse for food, then for goodness sake dine in.	0
This is a great laundromat! It was clean, the owner was actively keeping it clean. They owner was very friendly and helpful. The washers are newer and I feel like they actually got my clothes clean.\nThere is a starbucks nearby and you can get wifi from nearby businesses.	1
I have tried other laundromats in the area but prefer this one over all. I typically use the $3 machine and can get a full laundry basket of clothes in one and they come out well-washed! I swing by to put my clothes in the wash and then go home or grab a bite to eat for the next 40ish minutes while they're cleaning. I would never worry about things going missing or my clothes being touched here. \n\nI have also used their dry cleaning service and they do a great job!	1
Worst auto bell in town. Do not go here. It wasn't even decent enough for one star.	0
These guys took ME to the cleaner!\n\nI used this dry cleaner for the first time recently, and I was really disappointed.  I knew going in that they were expensive ($2 per laundered dress shirt), but it was a bit of a time-sensitive deal, so I went there, dropped off my shirts and a few suits.\n\nWhen I went back to pick up my stuff, the guy tried to ring me up for a total that sounded higher than it should have.  I asked him to see the itemized bill, he gave it to me, then, without saying anything at all, rang me up again for five dollars less.  No explanation, no apology.\n\nNo repeat business for these jokers.\n\nAnd by the way, I found a place at Pecan and Central that charges $1.50 for shirts.	0
Driving down 7th, I got reallllllly excited seeing a little mom-and-pops deli. The first thought that ran thru my head: Do they have prosciutto and cappicola? The answer: Prosciutto- yes; cappicola- no.\n\nSo I ran in to get my cold cuts, looking forward to a phenomenal lunch. The quality of the meat was very good. The service, not so much.\n\nI stood at the counter nearly 25 minutes as he cut me 1/2 pound of turkey, prosciutto, american cheese, mozzarella, and bologna. 25 MINUTES! On top of it, the guy wrapped the meat soooooo tight that it took me another 20 minutes to unwrap to make a sandwich.\n\nAlso, what kind of a market doesn't have bread you can buy? Literally, the entire store, NO BREAD! The only way I could have gotten bread was to order a sandwich and take it off. \n\nWill LBD be going back to this place you ask? Undecided. If I do, he will definitely order his meats before he goes, to ensure he doesn't have to wait any longer.\n\nThis place needs improvement in the meats department. LBD scale- 3. PICK UP YOUR GAME!	0
Solid deli with good ingredients, quick service and reasonable prices.	1
Yum Yum YUMMM!!!  I passed by this place several times and decided to give it a whirl for lunch.  Best wrap I have ever had!!  I love the variety of flavors you can get- Wheat, plain, spinach or tomato basil.  I had the Health wrap & the grilled chicken had a delicious black paper seasoning along with fresh veggies.  Macaroni salad was tasty and I love the different drinks they have to offer along with the candy on the counters.  It's a lot of fun in there!!	1
What a great deli! With a menu that offers breakfast items to sandwiches & salads, with a variety of sides, which I will say remind me a New York Deli, they offer macaroni salad, potato, pasta salads, and so many more. And, the deli meat is Boar's Head, the best! I ordered the Turkey Club with a side of macaroni salad and loved every bite! The staff was great & service was fast, even with a line upon arrival. I definitely look forward to my next visit!	1
Looks like just another house from the outside as you go zooming by on 7th Street, but this family-run garden shop is worth a look if you need to spruce up your yard or get your green thumb on.\n\nThe inside of the house is more like a gift shop with a pretty wide variety of gardening gifts and knick-knacks- from watering cans to small planters to all kinds of kitsch one can stick into their garden.  If you are searching for a unique gift for the gardening friend, this would be an excellent stop.  \n\nOutback they have an impressive selection of fountains and larger pots to hold your green-wares.  It's fun just to stroll thru and look (and listen) to all the options bubbling thru all makes of vessels and sculptures.  \n\nDuring the planting months, they do carry the obligatory selection of vegetables and herbs.  They also sometimes carry some more interesting things to plant.\n\nThe real reason you should visit here, though, is for the advice and expertise of the owners who know their neighborhood and the surroundings.  They love to chat and will answer your gardening queries with lots of options.	1
Charming place! Plenty of fountains and garden decor.	1
While I like the Melting Pot, I just can't help but be amazed at the place.\n\nYou go in and order a plate of uncooked food and watch someone come and put together a pot of (cheese, broth, chocolate or perhaps all three if you're feeling hungry), then you cook it yourself, all the while knowing that you are about to spend a large portion of the night in the process.\n\nAt the end of it all, you drop a pretty good chunk of change and you walk away happy.  I need to figure out how to get in on this action.\n\nYou might think that I don't like the Melting Pot, and you couldn't be more wrong.  I actually enjoy the place, other than the fact that it takes a while to work through the dinner (and the fact that I have to pay, and I can't figure out how I can get in on it).  And I really prefer the University location to the Midtown one.  That's why I only give them four stars here.\n\nBut overall, I'm a fan.  Just don't worry about your wallet.  And don't wear a watch.	1
I go here quite frequently at least once a month. And I have to say I loveee this place. Especially the Kings Drive location, their layout is more intimate and better. I love their house salad, their house dressing is amazing.  My favorite is the court bouillon broth, with the Pacific Rim Selection, and of course add cold water lobster tails. Their service is impeccable. And their database is amazing, they know everytime which table and server that we like to have. And their dessert ... goodness just so delicious. We typically go with the Amaretto Meltdown. We love it so much, that we even got the melting pot cookbook, But it's just not as good as dining there. I would say that this is the Ritz Carlton of restaurant in regards to service and the quality of the food	1
I like the food and the whole fondue experience of the Melting Pot but I give this place only 2 stars because on my last 2 visits, I had experienced terrible service.  When I go to a restaurant planning to spend a minimum of $30 per person (excluding drinks), I expect a better level of service than I have gotten here from hostesses and wait-staff.	0
hubs and i went here once during restaurant week and partook in the special they had going. which was a discounted price of the 4 course classic option\n\nwe choose the Wisconsin trio cheese fondue, which I did not care for, the wine taste was really strong and a turn off for me.\nthe entree was really nice, we upgraded to the Mojo broth which is fabulous! i don't remember which entree we had but there was beef, shrimp and pork and chicken. \n\nwhen dessert came time we went for the yin yang chocolate. which we needed more of the dipping fruits etc because 2 pieces of each was not enough!\n\nthis is a nice strange of pace for a night out. allowing plenty of time to talk and eat slowly and just enjoy the company of the person you are with. i would love to go back only the cost is a little high to go regularly	1
"I dig the melting pot, i mean, its fun. Fondue=fun. This was another  \""Yay my birthday is during restaurant week!\"" dinner for me. The cheeses, meat course and salad are good but lets be honest that dessert is where its at. Id get all 3 courses as dessert if i could.   A big pot of chocolate and then cheesecake, rise crispies, bananas, strawberries, red velvet cake and marshmallows all to dip into it. Heavenly is an understatement. \nI also dig that your in control of your own cooking times. So what if i cook my steak for 10 seconds...rare is good yo...\nGoing with a large group is smart. Then you can really sample a lot of the stuff on the menu. Our party had 8 peeps in it so we got 3 different cheeses, cooking styles and  chocolates. Service was aiiiiiight considering it was a large party, but it coulda been better. I normally wouldn't be able to afford more than one course here but at $30 for everything during restaurant week it's a hella great deal."	1
We have been here a number of times, and I have enjoyed it more and more each time.  We have gotten such phenomenal service.  Our last server was great and allowed us to tweak anything we wanted in terms of substitutions and omissions.\n\nWhat I love best about the place is that dinner is an experience and you get to relax and enjoy the large variety of food in your own personal little section.\n\nThe prices are very high, so we do not go here much, but this is a staple for restaurant week.	1
I visited the Melting Pot during restaurant week. Typically I'm a little leery about dining out during this week as i have had several bad experiences. This was not the case at the melting pot. They quickly seated us and our server quickly greeted us. He explained the entire menu, he talked about each dipping sauce, how to cook your food, etc. He definitely made sure we didn't have any questions. The food was just OK. I went more for the experience with my friends and really enjoyed myself. I would go back for a special occasion but probably not anytime soon. It truly does cost a lot of money to cook your own food.	1
I love the melting pot! Everything from the drinks to dessert were amazing. I tried the white peach Cosmo... Very good! My boyfriend had a bells two hearted. Our dining experience started with the green goddess cheddar cheese fondue. Next course was salads. My boyfriend had the spinach mushroom salad while I had a Caesar. Both were super tasty. My caesar had pine nuts on it. Loved the added crunch. Next course was entrees with assorted proteins... Chicken, beef, salmon, tuna, & shrimp. My favorite was the tuna but everything was delicious. Mine and everybody's favorite course is dessert. We got the snickers chocolate dip. Why this isn't on the menu is beyond me. Its great with bananas. \n\nGood food + good service = good times!\n\nWe will be back!	1
Great food, great service, wonderful atmosphere! It is more main steam than before but the food is still great!	1
"Went to get nails done for the panthers playoff game. Wanted a black base w/ blue stripes. The younger girl did them and did a bad job. The worst part she even told me it was \""not her best\"" and she was disappointed with how she did them. The lines were all different sizes. She made an excuse that the brush was too big. She was about 3/4 of the way done and about 4 woman came in to get their nails done...the girl decided to rush through my nails to quickly get me done, i guess she figured she had already screwed up so no need to keep trying. Then I sat to dry and the owner came and sprayed some kind of quick dry on them and it caused the paint to sort of bubble up......yeah and paid about double since it was a design...even though it was my regular nails.  Only reason I would go back is for a basic manicure or pedicure...hopefully couldn't mess that up."	0
I just moved to the area and was dreading the task of finding a new nail salon.  I loved my old salon and was very sad to leave, but then I stumbled across Spa and Nail and couldn't be happier.  I agree with the previous review from Nikki - they had me cracking up the entire time and I left with a huge smile on my face.  It was such a relaxing atmosphere even though it is a smaller space.  It's been almost a week since my mani and pedi and it's still going strong.  Unlike some places I've been where the polish starts chipping off after 2 days.  I highly recommend this nail salon and will definitely be going back!	1
Great customer service and an awesome selection! The staff is very helpful and can special order anything you need. Great prices and super close to CMC-Main. I love coming to buy my scrubs here!!	1
I'm not a fan of watered down vinegar sauce with a few specs of tomato at all.  I gave it two-stars just not to be a jerk, but I tell everyone not to go here.	0
Not too bad, but considering I had not eaten here up to very recently in the almost 10 years I've worked within a block I must say I was a tad disappointed.  Think I'll try again to see if maybe I just came on an off day.	0
Maybe my standards are too high. I had high hopes for the breakfast biscuits here, based on various reviews online, but in the end they taste like frozen biscuits with various toppings. I had a chicken biscuit, and the boyfriend had egg and bacon. Both biscuits had that sweet, frozen/refrigerated/pre-made biscuit taste, rather than a true buttermilk biscuit taste. If I'm getting chicken / bacon / other savory items on my biscuit, I don't want the biscuit to be sweet! We also got potatoes, which were good, but they were nothing particularly special. In the end, I can make a better biscuit, and even the biscuit sandwiches from Bojangles are probably better than these (gasp). \n\nI want to go back to Art's for lunch soon, because I really, truly loved the atmosphere in there. The staff were amazingly nice, it's a cute little place, my order was ready quickly, and I like to support local business. But the biscuits just don't cut it for me to try them again.	0
I haven't eaten here that many times, but I got take out last weekend and it was awesome.  I got the chicken in lemon sauce with grilled artichokes which came with creamy polenta and a veggie (it happened to be cauliflower on that day)- not only was the food fantastic, but it was enough for me to eat two fulls meals.  I also got the side salad which came with a really great homade sundried tomato dressing (also the salad was under $3 which you don't find anywhere these days).  My boyfriend had the penne with meat sauce which he liked, but his portion was noticably smaller than mine- I think the meat entrees are prob a better deal.  The entire meal came with half a dozen garlic rolls, on the house.  Oh, beware that if you go on the weekends this place is packed- I could barely get to the bar to get my to go order.	1
I love Italian food, and I love Mama Ricotta's, so that should tell you something.\nMama's (as my friend's call it) is kind of unassuming, placed as it is in a strip mall-type of place.\nThe restaurant itself isn't very large, which can make for some crowded times during dinner and, somewhat surprisingly, lunch.\n\nThe food is outstanding however. The pasta is homemade, and the garlic knots are a must. I am a big fan of the angel hair and the lasagna.\n\nSome dishes may be a bit pricey, but at least you are getting quality for your money. \n\nIf you are an Italian fan and a bit tired of the chain restaurants such as Olive Garden and Carabba's, you should take a chance and check out Mama's.	1
We decided on Italian for the evening since my brother is a vegetarian and no one else was interested in dining at the Penguin Drive-Thru or Price's Chicken Coop.\n\nThe atmosphere is very relaxing and comfortable. I am a fan of dim lighting, it's very calming and soothing. We are immediately greeted by our server who wasted no time with the drink and food specials of the evening.\n\nI opted on the alcohol because I was still feeling nauseous from the 6 hour flight. We decided on sharing a large pepperoni and sausage pizza with a family style portion  of their Rigatoni with this sausage meat sauce. \n\nService was great, the refills and warm herb bread with a spicy chili oil kept coming. I was stuffed but satisfied. Not bad for my first Italian meal in North Carolina.	1
Delicious!! I heard so many good things about this restaurant and finally tried it! Now it is one of my favorites in Charlotte. Their pork ribs are outstanding and I now crave the goat cheese and mascarpone appetizer. The portions were huge. My boyfriend and I splitt the pork ribs and we were both stuffed. Everything I've tried at Mama Ricotta's has been fabulous!	1
I agree with Nicole about the bar staff friendliness.  They are alway so happy to see you!\n\nI stopped by Mama's for dinner last night and ordered some of the goat cheese dip and the spiedini di carne salad.  Great choice.  I was intending to go for a light dinner when I came in but ended up stuffed.  The goat cheese was the primary culprit.  Very savory.  The salad was solid as well.  The steak was delicious and enjoyed the many flavors the rest of the salad contained - full of grapes, tomatoes, olives, cheese.\n\nVery satisfying!	1
Went during charlottes restaurant week, it was just OK. The marinera sauce was bland...their pizza is great tho :)	0
On Friday night the office I work for had our Christmas Party at Mama Ricotta's. It was a great time, it has a great atmosphere but the food was sub par. I think we ordered every appetizer on the menu.\n\nCalamari - It was ok, I am not much of a fan it did seem a bit on the rubbery side. \n\nBruschetta - Was very soggy with the tomatoes, not sure if that was the point but soggy bread is not very appetizing. \n\nTomatoes with mozzarella - The tomatoes were great but the mozzarella slices were SO thick it was ridiculous, nearly double the size of the tomatoes. \n\nGoat Cheese - This was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night. Very rich and smooth. \n\nI ended up ordering the special of the evening: Chicken and spinach ravioli with white truffle oil. It was good but nothing to rave about. \n\nI have had way better Italian in Charlotte so its hard for me to recommend Ricotta's.\n\n\nOh and I dont know if it was me but the floor seemed super slippery!	0
"Most of the Italians I have known have mothers and grandmothers that are very likely to tell you, \""You're so skinny! You need to eat!  Sit down and let me cook you something.\""  That kind of woman, who can cook me something anytime she wants, must be behind Mama Ricotta's.\n\nIt's very warm and inviting inside, with bright reds and oranges and fun paintings, while still being dim and intimate.  The great wood stove and friendly staff that greets you certainly sets the stage for the evening.  We started with the goat cheese appetizer which was creamy and decadent, though didn't scream \""goat cheese\"" to me.  It was very good, nonetheless.  For my main entree, I got one of the great meat sauce pasta dishes which is everything you expect great Italian food to be.  I was also impressed with the wine list (which comes to you as more of a book than a list) and the many small-production Italian wines that it contains.\n\nThough a little tough to find, given it's strip mall locale, Mama Ricotta's is a must-try!"	1
Scrumptious. Got a personal pizza with gorgonzola, chicken sausage, and red onions. Red sangria was good too.	1
our favorite restaurant in Charlotte for a sit down experience\n\nThe only way you could complain is if you go there expecting authentic Italian\nI argue this is better.\n\nGoat cheese mascapone is to die for\n\nVodka penne is amazing \nPortion sizes will make you take home a box. \nSplit a meal and can be very economical\n\nI could spend a few pages glorifying this place.\nI bet the negative reviews are from people that ordered a dish they would not like at any restaurant, or from people that go during restaurant week when they are slammed	1
Took the girls here for Mother's Day and sat on the patio, which is even more attractive with the new greenway. Unfortunately it rained so we could not take a walk after the meal. We had a reservation and were seated within 7 minutes. Excellent waitress, good food. A local favorite.	1
Here on June 14, 2012.\n\nHad amazing food here. Chicken breast dishes give enough food to bring home another meal.  Tasty food with traditional italian seasoning. Suace homemade and delicious. Easy to park. Has outdoor seating, too.	1
Y'ALL CLEARLY HAVE NEVER EATEN OUTSIDE OF CHARLOTTE. Mama ricotta's is a 1/2 step above olive garden, now ive never eaten at an oliver garden but thats what i imagine. its pretty standard mediocre italian food that emphasizes alot of heavy cream to create flavorful dishes, which is just so not italian. \n\nNot that there is anything wrong with mediocre italian food, it fills you up, but 4 stars is crazy. Both times ive had the penne alla vodka, once again its pretty mediocre. \n\nFried calamari was fried calamari, it did not kill me, but i laughed when they served it with hellmans chipotle mayo as the side (hello cocktail sauce? maybe a tomato sauce?). \n\nI will say its rather inexpensive so compared to a luce or vivace i can see this being a fan fav.	0
i enjoy the food from Mama's it is my go to place for a good meal and wonderful service.	1
This place didn't have the authentic taste I was looking for. The atmosphere is nice but the food quality was lacking.	0
What a nice treat! The bread, to start, was fresh and seasoned with Italian herbs, and served with olive oil & red pepper flakes, yummy! The shrimp and crab risotto was delicious, creamy & buttery, a true risotto. We also ordered the Pollo Alla Griglia, a seasoned grilled chicken, served with mashed potatoes & the vegetable of the day, which I substituted for the grilled asparagus, delish! The service was great and the wine selection perfect! An enjoyable evening in the patio, and somewhere we will return!	1
Food was terrible service was ok. We were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait and it turned into an hour and a half wait. Totally not worth it.	0
Maybe we came on an off night? We used to really like their lasagna and pizza. The visit before this one, they changed brands of Gorgonzola and  the pizza was too pungent to finish.  This visit we noticed the menu is getting lighter and lighter and not for the better. Even the rolls were almost stale. Glad we did not get the bread pudding for that probably would have been off too. I will say our server was great and very attentive.  Guess I will stick to a salad, appetizers and bread pudding.	0
Found this place on yelp while on vacation in charlotte.  We wanted Italian since we had satisfied our palates on other foods throughout our trip.  Don't be fooled with the strip shop location, this is a nice little place very close to downtown charlotte.\n\nI had the chicken parm-- way to much for me to finish.  Which was a shame since I was not going to travel with my leftovers.  Wife got the oxtail ragu dish, she was not a big fan of.  Fatty beef, etc.  our two small kids are just fine with buttered spaghetti noodles and parm cheese.\n\nWait staff was very good.  Highly recommend this place if you're looking for some nice Italian.  Family friendly, but you can also do a date night here just as easy.	1
Our waiter Peggy was very polite and we enjoyed our food.  I really liked the warm bread.	1
Mediocre Italian food. I had a pizza and it was quite bland. The waiter was nice, though.	0
The food here was just adequate. And the ridiculous part of our lunch was that the check  was delivered before the meal! What's that about? The waiter said they get really busy so they bring the check first. I've been eating out in restaurants for many years and no one has every brought the check before a morsel of food was eaten. The menu states that whole wheat pasta is available but never mentions it's a $1.50 up charge. I might return someday but I won't be anytime soon.	0
My wife's favorite Italian spot. She loves the penne ala vodka, made with pepper vodka!  Fresh baked bread is amazing.  Tried a slice ifU daughters pizza, very good!  Service is usually really good.  The last time we were there the server was slow but very friendly.  I would put this in the top 5 Italian eateries in Charlotte.	1
The food was good and plentiful. Waitress was friendly, and kept checking us and refilling my sweet tea glass( this is a pet peeve when I have to ask). We ordered the calamari appetizer, chicken parm and chicken cioffa, and bread pudding for dessert. All items can easily be shared.	1
I have been here twice recently. Once for lunch and once for dinner. I love the patio here and enjoy the overall feel of it. The calamari is decent but the goat cheese app is something I frequently dream of!! It is amazing. It has marinara and toasted bread points for dipping. I have had the spaghetti with meat sauce and the ravioli with meat sauce. The angel hair is made in house daily and just to die for. The ravioli is cheese filled and the meat sauce is a lovely combo of meat and chunky tomatoes. \n\nThe food is awesome and the service is good as well. I noticed they have a pizza oven as a center piece so I would love to try their pizza next time. But overall a great find for a really decent price. They also have family style dishes which is one of my favorite things ever so I plan on trying that very soon as well. A def must try at least once!	1
We were in Charlotte this past weekend and we were in the mood for Italian, so we went to Mama Ricotta's. I am glad we made the choice to come here. From the moment we walked in, the staff was pretty friendly and accommodating. We got the Burrata & Prosciutto appetizer, it was lovely. Our entrees were Penne Alla Vodka and Rigatoni with Meat Sauce. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful; just like Italian food should be. \n\nWe noticed that the dessert portions were enormous so we asked if we could be served just half of a tiramisu. Our waitress was absolutely accommodating and she made it happen. We weren't expecting to pay half price for the dessert we just didn't want the rest to go to waste, but she did charge us half price. I wish this place was in DC, we would be here all the time.	1
I do not have much to say about this place other than the food is horrible.\n\nthe people are nice but the food is horrible if you are itialian and the cook is not even itialian.\n\nstay away if you want real itialian food.	0
Great video store...huge selection of indy and foreign films, as well as mainstream.  Employees give ratings on some of the movies.  Only downside, some of the people behind the counter have huge attitudes.	1
Anything you could ever desire in film is available in this store!  Not to mention, it is categorized so perfectly: by country, director, genre, etc.  There was a place like this in Boone called Fat Cats (which also carries vinyl--love it!), but this store carries many more titles in VHS and DVD.  \n\nI found that the staff was very friendly, and movie buffs themselves as well.  I just wish that someone like that guy from Clerks worked there, just to spice it up and add a little comedy.  However, there are thousands of indie flicks (and mainstream too) and the membership is free.  \n\nI think I will pick up the City of God television series next time I am there, because the movie was so damn good!	1
To join the chorus:\n\nInsane selection (except for the sci fi - that could use some beefing up, if anyone's listening), hot ladies,  well-plastered and informative bulletin board, great hours, rack of cheap used dvds and vhs's begging to be made into gag gifts, largest Criterion collection this side of, um, anywhere, candy, MST3K on in the background more often than not, offers to reserve a new flick that's checked out for no additional fee, what's not to love?\n\nNothing, that's what.  Get yer toukas over here and rent something.	1
Best Video Store in town. I drive an extra ten minutes to rent here but always worth. Only complaint is the price is a bit much. Staff is Awesome and know a thing or two about movies. They have some really hard to find movies. \nBeats Redbox,Blockbuster and Netflix. Of course the best part is it is Local!!	1
"Visart is the poop. Awesome selection & the staff kicks it, arse that is \nThat being said, support them. They're local through and through, and i'm down with ANY place that let's me bring my masculine, ferocious, killer dog inside. \nI know we're in the age of \""everyone's okay no matter what\"" but if you don't like this place, you suck. If you think the staff is handing out good customer service only to those who are \""cool\"" you're trippin. It's a video store....with movie lovers working there..and something ALWAYS playing on the t.v.s..don't take it personal. The place is the shiz you can watch everything from Buster Keaton to blacksploitation to british drama to movies from, i'm pretty sure, every country in the world. There's something for everyone. So, even if you think the staff doesn't like you, dry your tears and rent a movie. Tell them you think that and move on with your movie."	1
They used to be so cool. Took money out of my account for late fees. Never notified me, never called NOTHING. This used to be a great place now  after years of supporting them i have had enough of argumentative cashiers acting mean.	0
UPDATE! Received an email from the owner which was a little intimidating stated that I should remove my post. Kinda think they should improve customer service then send an email.	0
Occasionally you can hear people in our town talking about how we need to support the arts. If that's your cause, this should be one of the first places to support.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Any budding filmaker in Charlotte needs to see the Criterion Collection movies from Visart. You can't get the included commentary anywhere else without buying the movies.\n*  TV series are a bargain. You can subscribe to Showtime if you want to see Dexter or you can just rent the seasons from Visart whenever you feel like it. \n* There is a place for mindless popular movies. Just as there is a place for women reading trashy romance novels. But there is a huge difference between popular movies and film. Visart has popular movies but can also can teach you about film.  \n* It's an experience to go into an independent movie rental store. Visart is no exception.\n\nThe only downside is that if you live far away if can be tough to get the movies back sometimes. But whenever that happens I look at it as a donation to one of my favorite local businesses in Charlotte.	1
Went here this morning to drop off some short-sleeved Polo shirts, with some minor stains I was hoping to have removed. I was greeted by a very friendly lady who look my name and information and handed me a ticket.  \n\nThe place, though fairly small, was neat and clean on the inside.  The staff is very friendly.   As far as the stains, I'll let you know how they turn out...	1
The staff were condescending and outright rude. \n\nThe place smells of a dentist's office, they don't have that much variety in their product, and the prices are subpar.\n\nAfter getting snapped at by one of the workers when I asked if they had any 52mm lens caps (the place they're normally kept was out), I decided to wander around and observe their interactions with other customers. It was much of the same. I watched them deal out the same condescending attitude and impatience with other people who came in. \n\nI'm impressed they can stay in business, honestly. My recommendation: just go online...	0
Rude staff, almost made me feel like it was a bourden to them for me being in thier store.... thumbs down all around	0
"I had an emergency on the morning I was leaving for Europe.  I literally said to myself, \""I could go to Best Buy, but I'm going to go to Bigg's because I can't take a risk.\""  They sold me an accessory that didn't work for my camera!  I even questioned it because I said it didn't look right.  I expect that at Best Buy but not at Bigg's."	0
Very nice venue\nI saw Jon Gordon speaker for the NEW (executive women) and was impressed with food and how upscale it is	1
The Hummus wrap at Sub Station II is by far, hands down, the best hummus wrap in the area. The bread is also fresh. For the life of me, I have no idea why people go to the Subway that is near it. It is a hangover cure. It is cheap. They have Dr Brown's root beer. AND my dogs are happily posted on the wall (the Christmas chihuahuas- one is the devil and one is the angel).	1
"Goodbye forever Subway. \nWhy would you want to go anywhere else after having a sandwich from here? Love me some Sub Station. Never have I had a bad sandwich here. Meat & breads are always very fresh, meat sliced when ordered. Have some very good hot subs too.\nIt is a little more expensive than other sandwich places, but you get what you pay for. Its worth it to me. Consistency is also a huge plus, you can always count on leaving full without eating crap!\nStaff is always helpful, and friendly, which is hard to find at \""quick food\"" places."	1
HANDS DOWN favorite place to get a sub! Meat, cheese, and other ingredients always fresh and tasty; I love the sweet tea; and every time I come here the staff is always nice. No complaints!\n\nUPDATE: They're called Sandwich Max now...and I havent had a chance to go back since they've changed the name, so a follow up will come after that!	1
This Substation II used to be my favorite place to grab a quick bite... but this past year I've been really disappointed. Either my tastes have improved or the quality has gone downhill.\n\nThe hummus wrap used to be my jam, but lately it's been bland and water-ed down tasting... maybe it's the iceburg lettuce? I do really still like the quality and quantity of the hummus and feta they add, but it seems the other toppings/condiments are lacking in quality.\n\nRecently I placed a take out order. Decided to try the 3-cheese veggie sub instead. They totally botched our order. Half of the toppings I asked for weren't there, and things like tomato that I requested be excluded were in abundance... UGH!  The quality of the sliced cheeses were yummy, but the wheat roll was dry and overwhelmed all the toppings.\n\nWhat's going on here?	0
Great place to see a band.  Just wish it was closer to my side of town.	1
Has the potential for a sweet, intimate venue.  However, when I went the crowd was very disrespectful, so much so that the artist requested that people stop talking.  I couldn't hear the music due to all the people noise, so I will not go here again for someone I'm really into.	0
I've been hitting different venues around Charlotte for years listening to live music...including Visulite Theatre.  It's a favorite pastime of mine.  Last night we went to check out Shooter Jennings (who is awesome by the way).  When I got there I asked one of the bartenders for a couple of waters.  He had immediate attitude b/c I wanted water and then charged $3 per bottle.  Later, I went to the other bartender for another water.  Hmmm, he charged me only $2.  Being a local Charlottean who supports a lot of local music, that left a very bad taste...\n\nAs far as the venue, it's got a lot of potential but it needs some sound system updates.  If you are up close in the pit, you can see great, but the sound is muffled b/c the speakers are actually over your head.  \n\nDefinitely prefer Double Door and Neighborhood Theater to hear music....	0
I'll keep it short: \n\nAwesome atmosphere, inexpensive drinks, cheap tickets to see great live music. All around a cool venue and a great time. I can't wait to go back!	1
This is by far one of my favorite live music venues in the Queen City.\nWhat I love most is you can sit or stand and see the entire stage even being short like myself.  The drinks are priced right and the service is friendly.	1
All be it a small venue, The Visulite is quite a nice place to catch a show. The have good beer prices, especially for a music venue. They also have decent bathrooms and plenty of room at the bar.\n\nThe stage is a little small but on par for the venue. It has a pretty cool design and good lighting. The seating is not that abundant, however there is plenty of standing room, especially right next to the stage.\n\nI have seen quite a few great shows here and I would say it's an all around fun time, each time. Also if you're early for a show, go get some good tequila and the 1900 restaurant down the block.	1
"Hail to The Visualite!  It is one of the best live entertainment venues in Charlotte.  Charming old theatre, featuring a small stage crowned with wings at the top and gathered drapes as a background.  Will, who does the checking in, has a gentle, laid back demeanor and \""good to see you\"" personality.  The bartenders are on the ready to assist you with making your favorite drink.  The Visualite features many interesting bands, and I think that they even have church on Sunday!  It is also one of the only entertainment venues that provides ample seating without an extra whack to your wallet.\nVisualite, don't change a thing."	1
Seriously the best UPS store in town. I'm not one to send a package every day, every week, or even every month, but I've loved this location and the staff each time. \n\nCompared to other UPS stores, it's not all that different. Ship your stuff, box your stuff, buy a P.O box, etc.\n\nThe thing that sets it apart is the customer service. Each of the guys that work here are fantastic. It's not that much to shake a stick at, but their great at what they do and they're rather kind. Andrew, namely, is the guy that has taken care of our needs each time we've come in. Great guy and always helpful, patient, and kind.	1
After being a loyal customer to this location and a UPS My Choice customer, I was extremely disappointed in their policy over a mishandled package. I attempted to send a birthday present to my father in Atlanta and after it did not arrive in time, it show up back at our house in Charlotte. I was told that their policy is to resend it or to receive a credit and I could send it through another provider. It may seem extreme to complain, when I could just resend it for free, but when a company fails to perform their primary service, I feel that they should make things right with the customer. This means going beyond offering the same service you failed to perform in the first place. Having lost faith that this location can perform a core competency and their questionable customer service, for the foreseeable future, I will be taking my business elsewhere and canceling my UPS account.	0
Nice, quiet, clean, pretty.  \nMy daughter gave birth to my grandson here.  I stayed during the duration.  What a great experience from this perspective! \nThe nurse and doctor were wonderful.  I felt at ease by their presence.  It was not easy seeing my daughter like this.  The result is more that I could have imagined.  \nIf you get hungry and have time to eat, the cafeteria had very good choices.	1
HORRIBLE HOSPITAL!!!!!!!!!!!\nChecked my mother in for a cough via Emergency room. DR wanted to keep her overnight and staff told us a room was available. SEVEN HOURS LATER they took her up to a room....finally ER stopped waiting on someone to transport her and took her up to the room on her own....THE WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE FOR A A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER!	0
My dad had a mild heart attack & was transferred from Presby-Huntersville to Presby-main. On a late Thursday morning he was transferred to a rather busy cardiac care department. It was established early that morning that he would need a heart cath & possibly a stint. From 10:30 AM to 6:00 PM, we waited in the small observation room. The nurses were not as pleasant as they were at Presby-Huntersville. The doctor who performed the cath/stint was very nice, however. We were very displeased in the wait time for the cath. The nurses didn't do a very good job keeping us informed of the wait time/delay.\n\nThe patient rooms are spacious & the facility was clean.\n\nThe cafeteria is very nice & the food was really good. The staff there were very friendly & helpful.	0
We were here to support our sister/daughter during the birth of her twin boys. The babies had to stay in the NICU and the nurses were very nice and helpful.\n\nHowever, the last thing you want to worry about during this joyous time is paying for parking. When leaving the garage in two separate cars, the first car paid the fee for the one behind and let the parking garage operator know. Despite this, the guy still had the gall to charge the second car again.  Ridiculous!\n\nDuring a time like this, we shouldn't be upset about getting ripped off. Very unfortunate that this employee ruined our opinion of an otherwise wonderful hospital.	0
This review is for the maternity ward specifically.\n\nI have had 2 children here and it was such an awesome experience both times.  Dr. Morris is the best OB/GYN, hands down.  He delivered our first daughter and even when he wasn't able to deliver our second, he made sure we were comfortable with the other doctor on staff that night (she was also from his practice, Providence Women's Care).\n\nEvery nurse we encountered in labor and delivery, the aftercare maternity ward, and the nursery was just amazing.  They even have lactation consultants that come through after you have your baby to answer any questions and to make sure breastfeeding is going well.\n\nThe hospital food is much better than most and they offer a lot of different options.\n\nThe labor and delivery rooms and the post birth rooms are so great.  They have everything you need which is very helpful if you forgot something in your rush to the hospital.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this hospital and Novant Health as a whole.	1
I took myself out on a date to celebrate the end of the semester teaching at ITT at Maharani last night. Before I switched teams to be a fan of Woodlands, Maharani was my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. \n\nI enjoyed Maharani last night again. I had the Vegetarian Thali, which kind of gives you the experience of eating buffet even when the buffet isn't open. The whole meal was a little pricey ($25 with tip), but it was more than I could eat. I had leftovers today!\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, and the food was delicious (if not quite as fabulous as Woodlands). I prefer to go to Maharani when there's a buffet, so I wish it had been the afternoon. It's great for lunch!	1
I've had curry and vindaloo but I've never really had Indian food beyond that and I never been to an Indian restaurant. All I have to say is I'm going nvm because now I have to eat one of everything on their menu. It was delightful. The ambiance Id perfect and the experience is one that feels authentic. I'm definitely coming back this restaurant for more Indian food.	1
it was ok, the actual food was pretty good. the naan was nice, the seasoning on both of our dishes was very savory, however be warned medium is very very mild, that was our fault not there's.  My problem laid with the service and staff, the ambiance and the loud music.  The staff was grumpy the music was loud bollywood which i think was only on for the staff and yah, i just dont know.  I think as a takeout it would be ok.   it is probably actually a 2.5 but more of a two reaching for a three than a three sliding.    food itself was probably a 3.5	0
I travel to CLT fairly regular on business. Went here with some co-workers and was disapponted. Waitstaff was not helpful with the menu. The food was mediocre at best. Had the paneer appetizer and it tasted like they were trying to make a McNugget with cheese. Sauces were tasty but now I wonder if they came from a can. If you really want great Indian food... Go to Copper. If you want McIndian go for it.	0
I went here for dinner on a Friday night. The place was empty and only one group walked in after me and my fiance. Oddly enough, the host sat them right next us and the tables are very close.\n\nSo the waiter brings out the papaadam. One side is burnt and they only offer one dipping sauce. \n\nThen, the waiter brings my wine, and forgets my fiance's beer. He then brings out our entree's: mushroom mutter and lamb korma.\n\nWe ordered both entree's spicy and the mushroom mutter was very bland. The lamb korma had a sour, tangy taste to it. The entree's were not horrible, but I would much rather go to Jaipur. \n\nThe naan is another story. It tastes like the freezer version you can get from Trader Joe's.	0
After I wrote this, my fiance got sick from the food. \n\nSo, I looked up their health code violations, and they don't store their food at proper temps.\n\nEw. :(	0
Having lived for 3 years in the Silicon Valley, home to some of the best Indian/Pakistani food I've ever had, finding a good local restaurant is always a high priority.  Tonight we tried Maharani.\n\nWhen I crave Indian food, it's not about the ambiance or the service.  It's all about curries, rice, naan and spices.  While Maharani is a decent restaurant, its food is nothing special.  I ordered my usual round of chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and veggie samosas.  The samosas were crispy but the filling was very pasty and far too pureed.  I could barely finish my serving of mutter paneer; it was extremely earthy tasting and the paneer quite bland.  That said, the chicken tikka masala was pretty enjoyable and had a wonderfully rich tomato curry sauce.\n\nWould I eat here again if I'm in the area?  Only if Meskerem isn't open.  Time to find a better Indian place, I'm afraid.	0
"The atmosphere of Maharani is nice. Quiet, with modern decor and Indian artwork.\n\nThe service is good; the staff always keeping an eye on our water levels.\n\nThe food was disappointing; not just my dish, but my three friends' as well. We got an array of vegetarian, chicken and lamb dishes and everyone left with a very \""meh\"" opinion. The spices weren't as distinct as most Indian places, the quality of the vegetables and meat were subpar, and the authenticity of the flavors fell short. I ate the small amount of Gobhi Manchurian I scooped onto my plate and then just chose to not finish it because it was so terrible (and for $12 I usually don't do that).\n\nI'd adventure elsewhere to Indian if I were you."	0
The lunch buffet is really great, everything is fresh and full of interesting flavor - nothing is spicy hot, though. Friendly staff.	1
I really want to love this restaurant but I really don't. I have tried it at the lunch buffet and I recently ordered rice, samosas, and naan, to accompany Indian food I was cooking at home. Sadly, both experiences were less than stellar. Bland doesn't begin to describe the food. Absolutely no taste. When I want to eat Indian food, I want to eat Indian food - not tasteless, spiceless, food. Did my Irish name cause my order to be overly Americanized?? :-) \n\nEven my little children were totally unimpressed. I am pretty sure we will not be giving this restaurant a third try.	0
After visiting a number of restaurants for the buffet, I have had some great ones...and some good ones.  Marahani's buffet was a good one.  A quick stop for lunch on the way to the theater provided enough nourishment to keep me from filling up on popcorn!  It was good...the butter chicken, the aloo tikki were very good. I was slightly disappointed with the watery tamarind sauce.  I love the sauce when it has a thicker consistency.  The service was sub-typical for buffet.  Not once did the wait staff ask if all was OK...or if we needed anything else.  OK...I am spoiled by better service....but you have to expect it when you are out at a restaurant.  It makes you feel like you are having lunch or dinner where you are really appreciated.	0
I love me some Indian food and so far this is the best I've found in Charlotte. Great portions, easy atmosphere, very attentive staff. So yummy! They have a dish called Shahi Korma with lamb in an almond sauce...AMAZING.	1
Terrible service! We were overcharged thanks to the waiters inability to split a bill - each couple on a separate tab - a normal thing to do in a restaurant - NOT HERE! They tally up the whole table and divide by the number of credit cards given and charge each one the same amount regardless of what each couple ordered. Do not make the mistake of going with friends and expecting the restaurant to be able to give separate tickets seems you have to sit across the room from each other and pretend not to know each other in order for that to be possible. Food was not what it used to be. Will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go.	0
very avg lik most other indian restaurant !! though its decent compared to the price (9 bucks buffet )!!	0
I ordered carryout at Maharani on my way home from work; I ordered the Murg Curry and garlic naan. The chicken in the murg curry was extremely dry and tough, the sauce was pretty bland and the garlic naan tasted like it had been baked the day before and left to sit out overnight before it was put in my carry-out bag. \n\nThe bar for Indian food has been set pretty high for me; I've cooked many Indian meals at home and have tried dozens of different Indian restaurants, but even still, the food at Maharani was pretty poor. \n\nI give it two stars instead of one because the staff was very friendly, and the decor when I went in was very tasteful. I'm hoping at some point I can brave going back and dining in, perhaps getting a different dish, and can raise my rating to 3 or 4 stars.	0
"It has been a long time since I have felt the need to \""Yelp\"".  Eating here night before last has brought me back to Yelp....and not in a good way.\n\nThe best thing about our meal was my Diet Coke.\n\nThe wait staff had to be reminded several times of what we ordered.  The food was not to my liking at all.  Honestly and truly ...as I was eating I was reminded of the scene in National Lampoon's European Vacation when Clark and crew at the French restaurant near the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe food tasted like it had been frozen and warmed up.  I have honestly had better RTE meals from Patel Brothers grocery store.  You know the type...the ones that come in the box for like 3 bucks....\n\nVery disappointed."	0
I've been to this place a couple of times.I recommend the mixed maharani tandoori entree that consists of shrimp, lamb, chicken, and salmon served with a salad and rice. All of the meat has a specific taste/texture and the naan bread is delicious. The service is very attentive and accomodating.	1
I came back here with a coworker for the buffet lunch and went back twice and walked/waddled out of the restaurant. HUGE improvement from my first review. So glad!	1
Maharani is one of our best Indian food places for me and my wife. It's not too pricey but classy enough to bring my in-laws when they visit, and I  always anxious to impress. The food is delicious, the wait service attentive. The butter chicken is the best in Charlotte. The only regret is they don't have mango lassi on their menu.	1
When me and my boyfriend came in, we noticed that the interior design was nicely decorated. As we were being sat, we noticed the table was literally five inches away from the table next to us. Not enough room for me and my boyfriend to leave if we have to go to the bathroom. We could not hear ourselves talk because of the conversation going on 5 inches from us. next, The buffet food selection was only eight to nine different things. The food was okay but lacked the spices and taste. The reason its not a one star is because of the excellent service we had gotten. The food was warm and nothing was heating it. We would not go back!	0
Really rude and non Indian people.....I have never had such a bad experience with any restaurant let alone Indian.....god bless them. I would be interested in seeing how long they can stay in business with this attitude.	0
Was very disappointed with level of quality and service. Ordered to go and gave clear instructions to have two separate meals. Each with naan and rice and utensils for work. Arrived to find one bag. One rice and one naan. I pointed this out and they fixed it but they forgot the naan. Looked at $35!!!! Bill and saw they double charged for the naan too. The vindaloo chicken was not spicy enough and very oily. The employees spoke very little English and that was a huge barrier. They also seemed arrogant and rude. I am thinking that most of these reviews are fake or people do not know what good Indian is. This was the worst Indian I've had in Charlotte. At twice the price. I now know why this place is always empty.  I have also tried the lunch buffet and while the price was better. The spice was horrible. All bland, boring curries and an always empty naan bin. Had to ask to get naan.  This place is PERFECT if you have money to throw away and want mediocre Indian.	0
I guess when you grow up eating authentic Indian food, the bar gets set pretty high.  Maharani was not at all what I'd hoped for.  The food was bland, under-seasoned and the woman working the door seemed not to care much that we bothered walking in.  \n\nThe decor is old and drab, the entire place having a rather sad mood.  Someone needs to wake up, update, and start cooking with passion.\n\nLife is too short.  Go elsewhere until that happens.	0
This is easily the best deal for great Indian food in Charlotte. The food is maybe one notch below Copper (upscale Indian location in town) but the price is about three notches lower. They do an especially great job with the classic dishes, and they'll adjust the heat level to your liking, making it a safe place to take guests with little or no experience with Indian food. Staff is friendly and very attentive. This has become my go-to place in Charlotte for Indian food and I'm there more often than I'm comfortable admitting.	1
I've been here tons of times and NEVER had a bad meal or bad service. In fact, I find the servers to be overly attentive at times. I always order vegetable samosas, garlic nan, and chicken tika masala. The food is always above average and consistent. I've yet to find better Indian in Charlotte.	1
Very few items on lunch buffet. On menu was aloo tikki, salad, plain rice, butter chicken, naan, chicken tandoori, chicken curry, palak paneer (paneer was hard to find), kheer (was good), finni that's it. None of the items were cooked properly. Very very disappointed. Price: $10.25 plate	0
Won't be back. I will preface my review by saying that I am a stickler for adequate customer service. That said, I have patronized this business at least 5 times with consistent experiences. The food is decent Indian food at a convenient location. The customer service however has been lacking each and every time. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was my entrance to the establishment today. As I approached the door, there was a server standing there who clearly saw me coming in. Instead of opening the door or at the very least, remaining to greet me, he turned and walked away. Once I entered there was no warm welcome (which I should not have expected given previous visits) but instead, I was rushed through to determine if I would stay for the buffet or if I was there to pick up takeout. I won't belabor the point, I will just reiterate that this was my last time spending money in a restaurant that does not appreciate my business. Their customer service is seriously lacking and the food is good at best but certainly nothing special.	0
I'll say I'm a fan even though I can agree with the other reviewer that customer service here might be an issue.  You really have to get past that though.  The gentlemen that runs this place is strictly business and it's a business he's good at.\n\nI can't speak to the dry cleaning side, all I know is that if you need clothes tailored or altered, this is your guy.  I had lost some serious inches and he made my old stuff fit like new.  Totally worth it.	1
Great Malaysian food!!! The service and prices are just as good!  They are very accomodating for large groups, I have been to a few dinner parties here and it was wonderful. If you like sushi they have a great sushi chef on site, they also have a teppanyaki (not table side though).  Malaysian is their specialty and they do it very well.  My parents and in laws love this play too! Good for both meat eaters and vegetarians!\n\nWhat I order:\n\nRoti Canai\nMango Chicken\nNasi Goreng\nSambal Shrimp\nMalaya Sizzling Steak\nChar Kway Teow	1
One of the best Spicy Tuna rolls in town. LOVE the hot and Sour soup and they are always so nice in there! My fiance is not impressed with the Chinese food on the menu but the rest makes up for it. Plus, they deliver :)	1
First trip here was on Sunday and I was thinking to myself how have I never been here especially when I worked up the street for a little while! \n\nI had a huge craving for asian maybe some sushi andit seemed like I was just not going to get it when I looked on my Yelp Application to figure what would be open to fill my craving a up came Cuisine Malaya!\n\nWe came in and were sat right away we started with the Shrimp Shumai which was ok but had a fishy taste to them but then went away it was weird...I had a Shrimp Tempura roll that I added Avocado to and it was perfect just what I was looking for! I also had the a Stir fry with a noodle and I cant remember what its called but they were delicious! \n\nI can't wait to go back and get that dish again!	1
I used to order from this place at least once a week when I had my project in Charlotte. The delivery guy knew my name and was always friendly with me. But, let's talk about the food. \n\nI usually got the curry laksa with chicken and salmon roll. The salmon roll is above average, usually has that fresh salmon taste to it, but it's not that large. The curry laksa is really great if you look that soupy curry. It comes with really tender chicken and is quite a mouth full to finish. I would recommend against the beef, which is also tender but chewy at the same time and the shrimp, which ends up being mostly tempura, but soggy because it was in the curry laksa broth. Best bet is chicken - it's soft and delicious.\n\nThe other dish which I would highly recommend is the Garlic Chicken. It doesn't sound like anything special, but I got this for lunch one time and was absolutely blown away. Perfect balance of spice, freshness, and a bit of sweetness.\n\nA good place for lunch - good atmosphere and incredibly crowded for how big the space is.	1
When you eat the real deal I guess you're a lot tougher.  I had laksa there.  VERY ho-hum and way way way too large.  No reasonable person can eat a huge soup like that and since when is laksa supposed to be that soupy?  And....unfortunately....it tasted...well....prepackaged.  Their other Asian cuisine isn't bad.  I guess for Charlotte it's a bit of an adventure but I found it rather generic.	0
"I've always liked this restaurant a lot for it's food but with a new GM Ian Kee I am at the \""rave\"" level. He's got some very interesting wines of which he's anxious to share tastes. Throw the men aside and discuss with him your likes and dislikes and he'll guide you to the right dishes.\nThe chef is very flexible and can tailor Chinese Malaysian dishes to your taste.\nBeef Rendang is great but the General Tso's  Red Snapper wasn't on the menu but it was great.\nOf course the Roti Canai is really excellent and authentic."	1
"This is one of my \""go-to\"" places when I'm in Charlotte. I've always had a pleasant experience except the last time I went. They burned my roti canai (the roti) and by the time they replaced it, everyone else at my table already got their main meals. The waitress was not friendly at all and seemed to have an attitude when I told her my food was burned. All in all b/c of that one experience I take down a star but the food is always good.\nTry the Kung Pao chicken or tofu!"	1
This place is amazing! They have the best Roti Canai! I am not much of a sushi fan, especially since I'm allergic to fish (oh fish!) but my boyfriend, who is a total sushi lover loved their ngiris and sashimis. For the main course, he ordered the Mee Goreng (Indian style egg noodles) and I had the Char Kway Teow (Malaysian pan fried noodles). I liked his noodles more than mine (as always) and he offered to swap. The Mee Goreng hit the spot because of the curry taste which is typical of Indian street-side Chinese food. They also have some very nice beers. At the very end, the owner came by our table and had a word with us too. I would definitely recommend this place if you happen to be in the Charlotte uptown area.	1
Consistently very good, in my regular lunch rotation, never had a bad meal here although the service can be a little hit or miss sometimes.  The sushi is very good and the sushi chef is great.	1
I came here for lunch and had the okra dish with chicken. There was something really odd about it - like they used dirty oil or a dirty pan for the stir-fry. I was quite disappointed. The bathroom was also a bit dirty. I think for great Malaysian food in the US you have to go to the DC area or California.	0
Malaya had a lovely selection of vegetarian dishes from multiple cultures.  I stayed close to Malaysian cuisine with steamed Vegetable Potiah appetizer and Tofu Sambal.  My mouth celebrated the rich flavors and varied textures of the dishes.  It's worth more time to further explore their menu.	1
Delicious, good service, one of our favorites places to eat.\n\nHighly recommend the sesame tofu - it is some of the best tofu I've ever had at a restaurant.	1
I'd like to eat there again, because they had SO many choices, and I want to try their sushi. I got the ginger lunch, which was good, but not as good or flavorful as it could be. It was just kinda meh. But the service was fast, which was nice, and they did a good job of keeping up with refilling our glasses. I'd go again, and next time I might order something with either more spice or a different kind of cuisine all together.	0
The food ain't bad.  But their predatory towing practices are.\n\nI parked in front of a sign that said customer parking only.  I was a customer, and my car got towed.\n\nThe owners of the business say its not their problem, its the owner of the parking lot.  The owner of the parking lot says its not his problem either.\n\nSo, my $30 meal just got a $120 tax added on to it.	0
Originally had planned to eat at Deejai, but we were hungry and didn't feel like waiting. I had heard about Cuisine Malaya but always was hesitant to try it. For some reason my expectations were pretty low (location maybe?) but I figured since the reviews weren't bad, I would give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nService was good and prompt. I ordered the curry duck. It was delicious. The vegetables that the duck came in were nice and fresh tasting and not soggy, despite the fact that the curry came in a bit of a soupy broth. My date had one of the noodle dishes with tofu and really enjoyed her meal as well. Her portion was also quite large, and ended up becoming lunch for the next day (bonus). All in all, a good experience and I am looking forward to trying some of the other items on the menu.	1
Absolutely excellent. The mumbo jumbo roll is loaded with fish, deep fried, and absolutely delicious. The sushi chef also sold me on the corona roll, which is yellowtail inside and out topped with slices of jalapeno and lime with a dot a sriracha.  A little understaffed tonight, and even sitting at the bar, the service was under par. The quality of the sushi and the coolness of the sushi chef Robert more than made up for it. Check in specials on yelp as well as foursquare! New favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. I'll be back this weekend.	1
Score 1 for Yelp!  After a failed attempt to eat at a local hotspot I re-check my Yelp bookmarks and voila!  There's Cuisine Malaya, all the way across downtown Charlotte.  I hoof it over about a mile and show up at this basic and simple cafe.  Inside, the space is big and I'm hungry.  All that walking has worked up an appetite and bonus, there's a check-in special for a free glass of wine or beer, woohoo!\n\nI order up a bunch of Malaysian items and they all please.  One roti canai, one Malaysian chili shrimp and a peanut pancake for dessert.  All well prepared, tasty, spicy and overall yummy!  Service is really spot on and the price is right.  Cuisine Malaya also serves up Japanese-sushi but I'd stick with the Malaysian.  Cause it was good!   So rock on Cuisine Malaya, you were worth the walk and thanks for the vino...	1
Stopped in for the Beef Rendang.\nThe place was busy when I arrived which is a good sign.\nIt was very good except the broccoli on top. It was easily removed. \nI ordered to-go and the person who answered the phone and gave me my order was very friendly. I will return when I am back in Charlotte.	1
I wish I was able to frequent this place more often, because it really is a wonderful restaurant where plenty of Asian cultures and cuisines come together.  The atmosphere is like a typical casual dining restaurant with a bar, great to bring a group of friends or family to.  The Roti Canai is what I mainly come here for - it's hands-down one of my favorite appetizers ever.  And the sushi, don't even get me started.  It's both flavorful and a work of art -- major props to whoever makes it or teaches other employees to do so, because it's incredible what you're able to do.  Shame I can only visit and this place on occasion; each meal I've had here has been nothing short of satisfying.	1
Love this place. Great sushi. Great service.	1
Excellents service, bartender recommended a dish that was'nt on the menu (but should be) called Sambal. He even went above & beyond recommended an excellent wine pairing to the dish. Def recommend!	1
Try it!  I was skeptical upon my first visit, wondering if there would be good sushi at a place that also serves many other Asian cuisines.  Wrong!  We enjoyed our sushi and I've been back for other dishes.  The food and staff are very good.	1
Always make sure to scrutinize a resturant review from a college student.\nIt's more than likely based on the cost of beers rather than food quality. \nMy sushi was warm, food was cold, and the chicken in my stir fry tasted old.	0
I've seen this place million of times since I've been in Charlotte and has never once tried it until a couple of weeks ago! My husband use to go to school by there and told me it was not good so that kind of stop me from trying it although I've heard good reviews from other people. \n\nWe finally decided to try this place since we wanted a break from Viva Chicken and it was close by. I was amazed! I got a hibachi plate with steak, chicken and veggies. It was super delicious! The meat was cook just perfect with a flavor glaze that is so good.	1
The best Malaysian food in town, also some great Thai food. The bee fren dang and garlic eggplant are favs and husband dear cannot eat enough of the Roti Telur!! Got to try this one if you like eastern tastes!!	1
My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place for a long time. The food was great and the service was great! Everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position. The food quantity and quality started to go down hill. There was hair in my food not once but TWICE every time I order a rice dish. The new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended I even brought it up. The sushi is very plain and not high quality either. As a college student, they forget to discount our meal from time to time but its the food that matters right? Their prices are constantly changing and for the amount of the food it is not reasonable. We will not be coming back at all. There are other places to go that actually care about their customers satisfaction.	0
not good - food is below average.. I will never go back	0
I'm always a fan of Cuisine Malaya!  The food is best at lunch because it's so cheap.  I always get the pan fried noodles... it's good.  Oh, but if you're not in the mood for noodles... the curry fried rice is amazing.	1
Pretty awful entrees, sushi wasn't bad and decent service.  The chicken they used in the pad Thai was so horrible I couldn't even eat it.  I finished half my plate and didn't get a to go box	0
This is the best location and most reliable location to get your details answered and business taken care of in the Charlotte area when it comes to H&R Block	1
"Good and fast Chinese food at a reasonable price.\n\nThere aren't that many options for a quick and cheap lunch in this area, but this one satisfies both needs for right around $5.  It isn't absolutely amazing and the lunch portion sizes aren't near as much as a lot of the cheap Chinese places are, but do you really need a to-go box at lunch?\n\nI took a friend and we got the sesame chicken and the general's chicken.  It comes with rice and an egg roll.  Both entrees had a decent fried crunchy texture and a note of fruit.  The sauces were a little thinner than most places but I don't mind not being dowsed with a ridiculous amount of cornstarch.\n\nIf in the area and not trying to deal with nuances of Piscies \""all you can eat\"" sushi lunch special I will be back.\n\nFYI, take a look at the pic that had been submitted if you want an idea of portion size."	1
I'm not a comic book person, but I have fun every time I go in this store. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, just like comic book geeks should be. I really like this location, as it's near the SubStation and Crisp, which are awesome places for lunch. It's a great stop for a longish lunch break. Get a yummy sandwich or salad, and then make your way into Heroes for a few minutes of geeky fun. I also recommend bringing a bonafide geek with you, as it will be much more fun to enjoy his or her pleasure.	1
"Heroes is the Most spacious and \""prettiest\"" of the comic shops in Charlotte. The staff is helpful and will let you roam to your hearts content. On the other side of the coin... I have found the prices on some rare items and variant comics to be slightly inflated. non the less. This is a great place to shop."	1
My husband, who is a huge comic book geek, loves this place. He always brings his out of state friends to it. I have only heard good things about it- and from very particular comic book geeks. It has a great vibe.	1
Just getting back into reading comics again and it has been an easy transition with this store in town. It's a very polished up comic book shop and I love it! \nHave yet to go into the store and not gotten into a good discussion about anything from NPR, the Walking Dead to Edward Abbey. So, yah I've never been ignored here. To boot they always are really cool with my niece's rolling into their store. Most comic books stores cringe at the idea of 4 yr olds coming in looking through the comics. \nIf you like fun, you'll like Heroes!	1
This is easily the best comic shop around.  I may be biased because I've been going here since I was a teenager but they are pretty great.  The staff is friendly and will explain things to the non-initiated and they have a good selection of statues, toys and other merchandise.  Check them out.	1
This is a great comic shop. It is family friendly and usually has some kind of event going on every so many months. They are very loyal to their customers and provide a wide variety of comics to choose from. If you have any questions they're happy to help and if you're looking for suggestions they usually have a good one! The only drawback is the parking; because of it's popularity it gets a little crowded.	1
I have ordered hot subs and for some reason they don't understand that not everyone wants white american. I gave them two chances and they haven't gotten it right yet! I will go to Sub Station across the street from now on!	0
Philly, yes! This is a small store and i you go to Jersey Mikes, you know what they have. Staff was nice and my sammich was good, so really can't complain here. I'll be back for another.	1
After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a sub and was completely unimpressed. Even though the shop was nearly empty, the staff was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple times.\n\nThe chicken parm sub I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of crispy breaded chicken inside, it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in cheese and a sauce one step away from ketchup. To top it all off the sub was microwaved, which made the inside insanely hot and turned to bread to rubber.\n\nMaybe their regulars subs are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a sub and soda, it definitely won't be here.	0
Just got a club sub and there was no lettuce, tomato, onion oil vinegar nothing I ordered a # 8 , it clearly says on the sign it comes with mikes  way or whatever, I'm done with jersey mikes	0
Walid did a great job tailoring a custom Brooks Brothers jacket (retail $800+) that I found at the factory story ($40).  For $40, he took in the Portly 44 and turned it into a 42 Regular. \n\nHe was quick to point out the working button holes and equally quick to tell me NOT to tailor another jacket.  He could have taken my money but he was honest and said the jacket didn't need tailoring.\n\nHe helped me understand his work and also took the time to explain how he completed the tapering, so that I would know which sizes and fits would best be altered.  This saved me a lot of money, as the factory store does not accept returns.\n\nI currently live in DC and I still get my tailoring done here while I'm in town.\n\nIn contrast, I paid a bit less at an Asian tailor that shall remain nameless down Park Road, but found that my pants still did not fit after tailoring.	1
Wali is a master tailor and does fantastic work altering jackets, pants ... you name it, he can do it.  He is attentive and really listens to what the customer wants done.  He takes pride in his work and makes sure the customer is satisfied with the piece before leaving the shop.	1
Great tailor, I went in today for the first time and the service was great. He was quick, he knew what he was talking about, and gave a really fair price. I would recommend to anyone looking for some quality workmanship for a great price.	1
Bought a suit online from one of my favorite vendors. Knew I needed to get it tailored locally, but didn't know where to go. Asked some friends and Myers Park Tailors was recommended over and over.\n\nWalid nailed the exact fit I was looking for at a lower price then I expected to pay. Great work and customer service. I'll be back.	1
"I went here to get my prom dress altered. After trying it on, they advised me to just get a hook on the back above the zipper rather than taking it in the 1/2\"" because it was a one time wear and it would be very expensive to do so. The hook worked great! It fit tighter and my dress remained comfortable all night. I recommended all my friends to come here for alterations because they kept the customer in mind (a high school student with a minimum wage summer job). My hook was only $9 and I saved so much money going here opposed to somewhere else. \n\nAlso if you come here for a small alteration like I did, bring cash! They take cash only for purchases less than $27."	1
Like some of the other reviewers have said, don't let the location or decor deter from enjoying some of the best Eritrean food you're ever going to find.  \n\nMy kids, for some odd reason, love Ethiopian/Eritrean food, and we've tracked it down in New York, Chicago, DC, and our hometown, Philadelphia.  I think we were unanimous that this was the best that we had ever eaten.  The spices were fresh, intriguing, and well-balanced, and the quality of all the ingredients seemed very high.  Good injera, too.  We loved everything on our platter, and were treated well by the hostess. \n\nIt's not going to look like much when you walk in, but stick around and order everything--you won't regret it!	1
If you can ignore the interior (which smells like tobacco pipe smoke and is a little run down), the restaurant owner's crazy friends, crazy Ethiopian tv shows, and the location, you'll be in for a treat. Very authentic and balanced Eritrean/Ethiopian food.\n\nMostly meat dishes on the menu with a three vegetarian options. The proportions are HUGE and they give you more than enough injera to finish your dish (and someone else's!).\n\nFriendly, hole in the wall place. I'll definitely return (for take out only).	1
Tried to have dimmer here. 5:12 and still closed. No note or sign for explanation.  Unfortunate because I would have enjoyed trying it!	0
I ordered a pizza at 10:25, just one pepperoni pizza, nothing fancy, and I did not get the pizza until 11:50. They sent me an email confirmation saying it would be 30-40 minutes, which obviously wasn't the case. When I called to inquire after an hour they simply said it was on it's way, no offer for a coupon or a comp pizza or anything. After taking one bite I'm less than satisfied. It's cold and completely unimpressive. To top it off when I had to sign my credit card receipt the delivery person asked me if thy could have my pen bc they left there's at home. I will never order from them again. There are far too many BETTER pizza places to indulge in.	0
This is not a review about Papa Johns in general.  I love their pizza.  This is a review of their store.\n\nTerrible!  Terrible and incredibly rude staff, terrible service, terrible manager, and the worst part, terrible pizza.  The last time I ordered from them, the pizza wasn't even edible and the cardboard broke when the driver handed it to me because the grease had leaked completely through during delivery.  \n\nTwice they've gotten my order wrong and they don't do anything to make up for it, I've had an employee hang up on me before even telling me the total for my order or asking if it was delivery/pick-up, and they don't honor the coupons online at papajohns.com.  Go to Domino's if this is your Papa Johns for your area.  I don't even like Domino's and order there now because this place disgusted me so much.	0
I was staying at Presbyterian Hospital with my boyfriend after surgery and was tired of the food selection downstairs so I thought ..... PIZZA!\n\nI checked online for the nearest location  of Papa John's and I called to make sure they could deliver to the hospital and it was no problem.  I placed my order online and in no time I got the call he was a minute away.  When I made it downstairs the delivery man was already waiting on me!  He was extremely pleasant and personable.  I could have sold the pizza four times before I made it back to the fifth floor!  \n\nThe pizza was still hot and extremely GOOD - we even offered his nurse a piece and she gladly acceptedl.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I ordered mushrooms on half because my boyfriend doesn't like them and it was on the whole pizza ( I loved it though).	1
"Worst experience with Papa Johns ever with this location. \n\nEvery* time I've ordered delivery it has been incredibly late. This past time was the worst. An order estimated at 30 minutes still wasn't here 1.5 hours later so I called and they claimed it had just left. They called up from the call box once and then left within seconds. (For whatever reason it went straight to voicemail, which I got notification of immediately.) I literally ran down and circled the lot and they were long gone. The store then pretended they couldn't hear me when I called from numerous phones and numbers until finally I interrupted their speech about the promotion and called them out for stuttering since they clearly heard me. (Before that they'd say the special really fast and immediately say \""hello? hello?\"" and hang up.) I will never order from this location again."	0
I received sub par service. My friend got cut off  and rudely spoken to while we were trying to order. All we wanted was a pizza and we have been put on hold for way too long. Don't know what to do.....	0
Decent service...horrible food. I can't for the life of me understand how this company is so successful. It could only be worse if it was yet another failed Greek attempt at Italian.	0
Always have been a fan of Showmars but never tried the breakfast there.  I wasn't dissappointed at all!  I had a turkey sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and loved it.  Along side of that I had a bowl of grits made perfectly.\n\nThe service at almost every Showmars is what I think really sets it apart from other chains.  It's always friendly and I feel like they are eager to please.  Not for nothing, the stores are almost always very clean.\n\nIt doesn't take a lot for me to be impressed but Showmars does it for me if I'm looking for something as close to fast food as I feel like getting without the terrible food of a typical fast food joint.	1
Pleasantly surprised!  1st time to Showmars.  The flounder is excellent!  We immediately received a warm welcome upon entering the restaurant. The food came quickly!  It was well prepared and delicious.  On my next trip to NC I will definitely stop here.	1
Good chinese takeout here, seems to be hard to find.  This is the Hoho Cherry House.  The Hoho China Bistro is no more, but I heard it moved here.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good value, but the food here is right about average.  General Tso's is OK.  This is more along the lines of a Panda Express, but mom and pop owned.  For that, I expected more.  Nothing to rave about, but not terrible either.	0
General tsao's chicken for take-out lunch broke the plastic fork I was using.  I probably caught them on an off-day.	0
Good, cheap, quick. Yum!	1
"I was actually pleasantly surprise by my visit to the Cherry House. After reading the reviews here, which are very mixed, I figured what the hell. Can't be worse than what happened to Hong Kong Chinese (read my previous review for that story).\nWhen I first walked in I was surprised by the cleanliness, and how well put together the interior looked, nicely decorated without going over the top. \nMy wife and I were greeted at the counter and took a minute to look over the menu.\nI went with one of their \""house specials\"" the spicy tangerine chicken, ordered with white rice, and an egg roll for $7. Not bad at all. The wife went with good ol' beef lo-mein. \nEverything was really good, seemed fresh, and had great flavor. This is slowly becoming one of my fav take out Chinese places around. Ho Ho Cherry House has my vote!"	1
Not good Chinese food.	0
"This might be the worst Chinese I've ever tasted in my life...and i'm a college student so I've had a lot. I don't have a car so i ordered the sesame chicken and the beef with broccoli to go...two of my favorite standby dishes. the sesame was way too battered and was smothered with the sauce so much that i was literally scraping it off. it's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff...nasty. and the beef with broccoli was worse! it tasted like the \"" brown sauce\"" was day old gravy and the meat was like the mystery meat that you'd get at a middle school cafeteria. on second though i think my cafeteria was better. and the broccoli tasted acidic. it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza. seriously, don't go here."	0
For Chinese food this place is inexpensive and well done. I was very happy with the amount of food and the quality for the price	1
Great Jazz and they even let people stand in.  Some high schooler was amazing on the harmonica.  As a big Slim Harpo fan I was very impressed.  The scene wasn't smoky at all.  Very nice although the crowd was small.	1
One of the best places in Charlotte for continual live music. Open since the mid-70s the Double Door inn has hosted a ton of top acts and is always full of people who love music. Charlotte isn't known nationally for its music scene but with venues like this, it is hard to deny that you can't have a great time with Charlotte music. Decent beer selection and regular visits from the legendary Bill Hanna (at least legendary for Double Door Inn visitors) solidify the Inn as a location for musical bliss any night of the week.	1
There is only ONE spot to go on a Monday night in Charlotte for live music!  It does not get better than the Double Door Inn!  There is a cover but it is worth it!  The bluesy music, electic mix of people, rustic bar and of course the PINBALL machine in the back make this spot a MUST DO!  Love you Double Door!!	1
I fell in love with the Double Door a few years ago when I first moved to Charlotte.  My boyfriend and I didn't have cash on us and when we realized you needed cash for entry, this guy who was a regular shelled out 40 bucks if we promised to keep coming back.  Nuff said...the crowd is always down \nThe Double Door never disappoints, great shows, great drinks specials and very casual.  They also have a pool table and old school pinball machine. They have a patio as well, but as a non smoker...I don't last too long out there.  Last time I was there a few weeks ago, I even got on stage and played the tambourine with the act, best night ever!	1
I really loved the atmosphere of this place. It reminded me of one of my favorite bars in Chicago so it really felt like home. The bartender was a great guy who was friendly and kept the drinks coming. I saw a few fun bands while I was there and the sound was great. Anyone looking for a friendly environment with good service and great sound should definately check this place out.	1
On Thursday 9/21/12, James Lastra played the Double Door Inn.\nAfter several successful shows at The Evening Muse, he was booked by Afton Showcase to play this legendary venue.\n\nA great honor to perform on the same stage with some notable artists like Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn and Buddy Guy.	1
Went here to see a band out of upstate New York Sophistafunk recently and a great time was had by all.  \n\nThe place is one of the smaller music venues in the Charlotte.  But that smaller size actuality work in favor of Double Door, there is a very homey, friends and family vibe about the whole place.  Genny to High Life.  \n\nThe band, Sophistafunk can be described as just that - sophisticated funk music.  They brought alot of energy and had the audience of about 30 people all dancing and moving to the beat.  \n\nMy virgin experience at Double Door was good enough so that I would def return.  Don't go to Double Door expecting some sort of top-shelf, Fillmore-esq music venue.  Yet, it serves its place as its a great venue to see up and coming bands.	1
I don't hit up too many late night spots these days. I've attended about 3 or 4 events here over the last few years. It's a small, intimate venue with a lot of character. After you order a Roanoke Railhouse (one of the few places it's on-tap in Charlotte right now), be sure to spend some quality time scoping out the wall decor. There's a lot of history and humor hung up there. There are tvs around the bar to keep you up to date on sports and news. In the back is a patio and a gameroom with a few arcade/pinball games and a pool table. The key part of this intimate setting is that as soon as a band takes the small stage, you can't help but start grooving to their tunes. Even if you're not digging the music too much, everyone else dancing and enjoying themselves becomes infectious. The downside to the small venue is that it can become hard to talk with other folks. If you're with a group and want to chat, head to the back for some space and a few less decibels.	1
"Hate when people vent on here about bad experiences, so please skip if you don't want to hear my rant. It's not all bad, despite a bad experience with one person, we had a great night.  \nWe went to the double door on Sept 20th to see the guitar freak genius called Reignwolf. The venue is cool in a historic dirty blues club way (hey Clapton's played here!), the beers are cheap and cold. \nUnfortunately the doorman is a real tool, I'd bought 8 tickets online for me and group of friends and coworkers. I arrived first with 3 others and 15 minutes later a second group of two people arrived (6 total)- it was then the doorman told me I had used up all my tickets. \nTried explaining we still had two more tickets and was basically told to \""go f$&@ myself\"". Tickets were just $10, but sucked to be accused of being a thief. Anyway, we had to purchase more tickets at the door. The band was great and we had good time anyway. Guess the best advice, just pay at door."	0
"Excellent venue. One of the best in Charlotte. It is old. You feel history. It is intimate. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars- it is inconsistent with their band bookings. Sometimes it is really good and other times it is \""meh\"". They definitely don't seem to pick up on traveling indy bands (they seem to go to other venues in Charlotte instead)"	1
My aunt was visiting from Chicago and booked a room at the Inn after the Vanlandingham estate (which is a sister business to the Morehead Inn) said they were full.\n\nWhen I dropped her off, I went inside to check it out, and I'm glad I did.  It's truly an amazing house.   Walking around the place, you can really start to feel as if you've gone back in time.  I only saw one guest room, but it was impressive.  very well appointed with antique furniture, it had a separate sitting room with its own couch, and the views were of the thick stand of trees to the east and south of the house.\n\nI also really liked the enclosure of live australian finches downstairs.  They're colorful, lively things to watch, and I was told that sometimes the cat they keep around the house just sits around staring at the birds.\n\nAnyway, if you've got guest coming from out of town who are into antique and ornate surroundings, they would do well to stay at the Morehead Inn.	1
Gorgeous- immaculate historic estate- very spacious stay in the Mt Vernon room. Wonderful breakfast- great friendly staff!	1
The only reason I'll even give SECU two stars is that I did end up with a pretty decent mortgage for my house here, and I also bought a nice birdhouse from them (inexplicably sold in the front lobby).  But my praise begins and ends there.  \n\nThe biggest problem with the SECU is their terrible hours.  Why, oh why, is the bank only open when we are at work???  Closing at 5:30?  Not even open on Saturday mornings???!!!  It's just crazy.  I've also found their customer service to be lacking (at least, on the phone), and they have NO ATMs uptown.  While I wanted to get away from Wachovia/Wells and BorA, I'm starting to realize that all these banks are the same (i.e. terrible).  Unfortunately, no bank I've found down here matches up with the service and convenience of my former bank, Citibank.	0
Best Chinese in town. Quick delivery, great service, great price.	1
By far my favorite Chinese food!  Usually get take out from here--I love their fried dumplings and chicken and broccoli.  Convenient location across from CPCC's IT building.  Sometimes parking is kind of an issue during busy periods, but it's worth it.	1
Definitely NOT a sexy establishment but if what you want is good hot Chinese food you got it!  There are tables and booths - the place kind of looks like a Burger King knock-off.  The have a TV too to watch while you are waiting for your order.  Located right by the Double Door Uptown - this location is super convenient for those of us living or working Uptown.  \n\nI got the Mongolian Beef which was the proper amount of spice.  Tender meat and lots of mushrooms and onions.  (You can request white rice also!)  Not too saucy and everything was great the next day.  It was so much food I couldnt finish it!!\n\nThe boyfriend got the Sesame Chicken and I tried a bite or two of his.  I don't like breaded stuff but it was very tasty.  Both orders together were around $15 bucks and came up super quick!  \n\nThey deliver too!	1
Hot, fast and very tasty American-style Chinese food.  Big portions and low prices.  I was staying at the Wingate Hotel nearby on a layover and these guys really made my night by delivering a tasty dinner with a smile.  Definitely recommend them.	1
My family and I ordered take out from here regularly and loved them. However, one time I noticed they had double-charged my credit card. I called them several times about it and was always told to call back another time when their manager was available. Eventually I told them no, that their manager should call me and left them my number. Never got that call, so now I have to find another Chinese take out place. Beware these crooks!	0
Great food. Not too pricey and they're always very quick preparing the order. I've never had them deliver, always carried out.	1
Some of the worst Chinese take out I've had in a long time.  I got the sesame chicken dinner combo. The chicken was overly breaded and very soggy.  The sesame sauce was bright red - as if they put the wrong sauce on my chicken and just threw some sesame seeds on top to make it look correct. I also had asked for brown rice, but they don't carry steamed brown rice.\n\nIt was very cheap - but I guess you get what you pay for.	0
"Well what is to be said about this place, for starter in just moving into Charlotte many of my coworkers and friends have recommend this place saying its some of the best Chinese food in town. As a food Connoisseur I enjoy Chinese food a lot but upon having high hope for finding a new place to enjoy some delicious cuisine the lack luster effort has seized to impress my expectations. The quality of the food has ranged from okay to mediocre, while the portions range can differ upon a full meal for an adult to \""emergency rations\"" that in turn causes the meal to become inconsistent and make not worth it's full price. It also seems that the cook doesn't put care into his work often times making the experience to be a let down and it seems to be the same at the all of the locations. My final verdict is poor, this place has a lot of work for improvement."	0
"I can't comment on the food (you'll read why) but the process of ordering online is horrible.  We placed an order online, knowing there could be up to 60min delivery time, and once I called 90 minutes later they said they didn't receive the order.  I got the confirmation email clearly stating our order, time it was placed, house address, etc.\n\nThe lady on the phone at first was very helpful and say we wouldn't need to pay.  I reread the order to her and after reciting the order she asked, \""How would you like to pay for this?\"" and followed up with \""Why wouldn't you pay for this?\""\n\nNice knowin' ya \""Fortune Cookie Chinese Restaurant\""......see ya never."	0
The lo mein is so bad. It was spongey and tasted like plastic. The sweet and sour chicken is just fine. It is what I expect from a chinese take out place. (You can sit in) I probably won't be going to this place unless I have limited options approaching 10:00pm. This place could make a killing if it stayed open till 12am-2am on weekends.	0
Their prices are reasonable & they deliver. Also the delivery service was quite fast. The food was where things started declining. The spring roll was fine, probably came from a box, but whatever. Crab Rangoon was terrible. For $3.75 I know they'll be using imitation crab..thats not really my beef..they were pretty flavorless except for the onion. Also ordered beef & mixed vegetable, meh. They're certainly generous with their portions. But quality & flavor could seriously improve. Will I order again? Yes, but thats just do to laziness.	0
Alot of food, resonably priced great service.  Parking can be a challenge at times.	1
Huge fan of this place!  Everything has great flavor, is hot and fresh.  I always get a different rice--shrimp, beef, house, and veggies with extra egg.  So great to be such a small place and the prices rock as well.  I had the spareribs as well and let me tell y'all something--Fortune Cookie puts an extra spin on them that make them addictive!  Go in for the service, leave out with your food, love your tummy when you get home.  Yes, four stars and I am all over this place whenever I get the hankering for Asian food.  And they are so nice!  When I call to order for carryout they listen well and read back everything.  After two orders, he said 'Blake?'  Yes ma'am!	1
Extremely poor customer service and do not offer the latest innovations in wigs. Maybe they were once the only game in town and are resting on their laurels...if you have breast cancer, the last thing you need is poor service and pushy sales clerks. I would give no stars if that were an option. Stay away.	0
Very pushy! I went with my mother who is fighting cancer , I was shocked at how pushy they were with her. They are taking advantage of cancer patients.	0
I think there is a lot better food to be had in Charlotte. \n\nThis place definitely has a romantic vibe going; its just that the food is not that good. Wasn't memorable, exciting or impressive. \n\nWould pass up in favor of something better.	0
"On a recent visit I had the duck which was tender enough to cut with a fork and extremely well flavored. The spinach and parmasean soup was out of this world! A fanastic find and very enjoyable atmoshpere. Resonably priced wine and good service make this a \""I'll be back\"" restaurant."	1
Very much enjoyed my dinner at Carpe Diem. \n\nI had a tasty scallop dish albeit a bit small portion wise and two delicious starters - the tuna and calamari. I was happy in the end that I did get appetizers or my meal might have been a bit small. The real stand out was the fresh bread- wow delicious..I literally couldn't stop reaching for another roll - even after I was full! \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive- he recommended a nice chardonnay for my dinner and was pleasantly surprised it was in the $8 range.The atmosphere was a little stark- nicer for a quiet date than a girls night. \n\nOverall id say bring your wallet- my meal with two drinks and an appetizer was about $60. I would absolutely visit again since everything was really yummy!	1
It'd only been~15 years since I last ate there - how dare they move?\nTwice?\n\nGraduation night dinner for #1 child - great intimate late supper with her and my the mother unit.\nFood was great, our server was gluten sensitive which really made ordering easy; look, I had wine and I don't remember much except for the fact that the food was tasty, the two ladies raved, and we didn't get sick.\n\nMinus a quarter star (thus retaining the 5 stars) for the dessert (a cocoanut cupcake with cream cheese frosting).  Our server couldn't vouch for it (since it was glutinous) and I should've trusted her.  It was okay, but didn't stand up to the rest of the meal.\n\nOh wait - I remember that I had scallops and they were the cat's meow!\n\nGreat ambiance; beautiful digs in a part of town that's apparently been fixed up since  we lived there and well trained staff.\n\nOh this pic:\nhttp://media3.ct.yelpcdn.com/photo/tqLbF9fRSYY-MJqG_EVMfA/l\nhappened to be in the Men's Room; it's a picture of the restaurant from when I last went to it (right next to the First Union building where I worked).	1
Nice place but the food isn't consistant. :( too bad because its a really nice place to have our date nights.	1
Very good and not overly stuffy. I enjoy this place.	1
Want to take your special date to a posh dinner? Dress fancy and get ready for a dining experience at Carpe Diem. \n\nI had to take Todd W's advice...goat cheese salad! The food was delicious! We ordered the cheese plate to start. It was proportioned well and the cream, the hard cheese, paired with the fruit and honey were just right. For the main entree, I ordered the vegetarian couscous and hubs got the veggie special of the day. Both were made fresh to order and I savored each bite. It was so good that even as full as I had become, I couldn't stop eating until it was almost gone. The wine list had plenty to choose from to make a nice pairing with your entrees as well. \n\nThey try to source what they can from local farms and they make a menu to reflect what is fresh for the season.\n\nI love having a 2-hour dinner without feeling rushed; it makes me feel high class. The server was very nice and attentive, giving us time to enjoy the experience.\n\nSave your Benjamin's and when you're ready to splurge treat yourself to a night at Carpe Diem!	1
We received a BoGo coupon in the mail and tested this place out. We walked in and were surprised by how quiet and welcoming the atmosphere was. I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Breast dinner and the meal was fantastic. One of the best chicken recipes I've had. Everything tasted like it was made from scratch.  I have no complaints and would certainly visit this restaurant again.	1
I had my birthday dinner here a few years ago. There were about 8 of us. The staff was extremely accommodating. The atmosphere is classy, without being pretentious. Based on the crowd and the decor,  I imagine this place would be great for happy hour too.   \n\nThe food was good. I had the scallops, which were pretty standard. But a few people let me sample their entrees. The pork chop and the fried chicken were very good.  This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion.	1
I had high hopes for this place. Maybe it was because it was restaurant week, but I was not impressed. The only good thing I have to say is the wine I had was excellent. Our waiter was lacking and did not explain the menu or specials. I had the goat cheese salad and it was good, but did not blow me away. We we're suppose to get the sorbet between courses to cleanse our palate but it seems he forgot to bring it. When the main course finally came I had to ask for a knife and he seemed to have forgotten who ordered what, so there was a lot of shuffling of plates. I got the trout and again I was not impressed. Dessert was the same, nothing special. Maybe this place is good when it's not restaurant week but I am not sure if it's worth the price.	0
Excellent spot in great area! The Food was very good and the prices were moderate. Service was good as well. Try to Fried Chicken Breast entree, delicious. Hanger Steak left a little to be desired though, but overall good choice. I would recommend.	1
Had the kale caesar to start and the buttermilk fried chicken (like apparently the majority of customers). The salad was very good and the dressing not too overwhelming. I especially how the made the substitute with kale, as it adds a good satsifying crisp to the taste. They gave a strawberry shorbet between the appetizer and entree as to clean the palette.\nThe buttermilk fried chicken was amazing. I've never had fried chicken at a fine dining establishment and it was a very refreshing experience. I'm from the East Coast so I might not have the most reliable comprehension of what the best fried chicken is but it was ridiculously good. The batter was very smooth and thin. The meat itself was very tender and had a distinct juicy flavor which went perfectly with the light gravy that came with it. I wish I could remember it honestly. Writing this review made me so hungry that I had to stop in the middle to eat something. Anyway, the waitress mentioned how the restaurant is owned by two sisters for a very long time and one of them does all of the baking. Next time I'll have to try the dessert.	1
"I cannot believe this place exists! How is it competitive in Charlotte?\nThe flavors are absurdly overdone: super salty, super sweet, and conflicting in that they pair savory with super sweet and drown it all out.\nI may have an answer: the place is filled with the elderly. Maybe it's \""The Walking Dead\"" tongues. Seriously, the youngest person there was in their early 50's. It's like a \""speak-easy\"" for the rich elderly...it just keeps afloat by a secret handshake that acknowledges you are in a terrible place but you can be old there without the riff-raff.\nAlso, it is terribly expensive for the low quality they are putting on the plate. Even the drinks are super sweet.\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!"	0
Authentic New Orleans flavor and great family atmosphere.  Not pricey, and the portions are huge.  The fish is fresh, and the service is friendly.  Live music some nights.	1
We've been to the Pineville location before, and I have to say that the experience there is many times better than this one (at least on this night).  While everything was decent, nothing really came together.  \n\nThe jazz band was decent, just don't make the mistake of sitting in the same room if you actually want to enjoy your meal, talk with your companions, that sort of thing.  If you're going for the music, that's fine, but for a quiet evening, it is not the room to sit in!	0
Skip this one.	0
3 people sat down...\nInteresting old house feel to the place. \n#1 - Etouffee shrimp - good shrimp, pretty good spice to it, nothing special that would bring me back\n#2 - Etouffee crawfish -  good crawfish but just like any other (customer 2 preferred this over the shrimp)\n#3 - Wash Day Blues - red beans and rice were blander than usual and the sausage was not cut up, hot sauce only can do so much\n\nFried Green Tomatoes appetizer was a hit with the whole table. \nDixie Blackened voodoo was delicious.	0
Easy to get reservations, prompt service, and DELICIOUS food!  I had the crayfish etoufee - rich and yummy.  Others had the chicken creole, shrimp & grits, & fried shrimp.  All reported yummy!  Nice atmosphere, too.  Took a kiddo (18mo.) and it was fine for her.  I will definitely be back.	1
Was recommended to this restaurant by the front  desk clerk at the Hilton nearby. My two co-workers and I were very happy with the food and the service. Portion sizes were more than enough. \n\nI ordered the Blackened Filet Diane and added shrimp. One of my co-workers had the shrimp, crawfish, and chicken etouffee, and the other got the princess cut Cajun barbecued pork chop.  And while each dish was wonderful, the presentation of the barbecued pork chop was simply beautiful! It was certainly the best looking plate of the evening.	1
I was looking forward to dining at the Cajun Queen from hearing about their authentic New Orleans cuisine to seeing their Best Cajun Restaurant in Charlotte status. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't memorable. I wish I could write about the service or the exact taste of the food but it was simply meh. I got the Blackened Catfish Filet with mashed taters (which I do remember and were fabulous) but I think they forgot the blackening on it or don't know what blackening means. I had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick.\n\nIt's a charming place however they had some live music which I personally found loud (and this moment right here is when I turned old).If you're looking for authentic New Orleans style food like I was, I would pass.	0
havent been there since i was a kid with my parents and after last night i will not go back. who's ever heard of bland cajun food, well somehow they pulled it off. i can make far better cajun food that at least has taste. the gumbo was terrible and the grits from the shrimp and grits were even worse, thank goodness they had habanero sauce to add some taste to this miserably bland dish. they did have dixie lager and dixIes blackened voodoo lager which is the only reason theyre not getting one star. the bartender was not pleasant either she obviously did not want to be there and it showed, when there are only 3 people in front of you, you should keep their water glasses full and beers a-comin' .  the band was nice and the place itself is nice but im never going back, hotel charlotte, danny's too and especially boudreaux's are all much better with regards to cajun creole cuisine	0
"I went last Friday to celebrate my 5 year wedding anniversary. Our 2 year old daughter was with us as well. The place was alot busier than I was expecting. It was such an exciting atmosphere. We loved it! My daughter said to us \""wow, were at a party\"". The music band plays upstairs and that is where we were seated. We had a short wait around 10 minutes and the manager seated us right in front of the band as if he read my mind. That is exactly where we wanted to sit. I'm not a fan of spicy food and the waiter recommended instead of blackened, I can order the fish or chicken to be grilled and it was amazing. The popcorn crawfish was excellent. Beers were $3, $4 The whole experience was great, fun and we spent only $80 including the tip. I had spent more than double that at Villa Antonio a few months back for my wife's 30th bday and did not have as nice of a time. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone wanting to have more than just your average dinner at applebees :)"	1
If you like your appetizers before your drinks....this is your place. Table had empty salt and pepper shakers. The hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty. This is NOT authentic Cajun food! The Champagne was flat.....horrible experience. Waiter was aloof.	0
Wanted to give this place 3 stars, but the waitress was weird.  The bill hadn't even arrived and my date offered to pay by handing the waitress her credit card.  Being old-fashioned, I wanted to pay for dinner.  The waitress was adamant on charging dinner to whoever was the first person to give a card.  I tried in vain, but she refused which was perplexing.  It might get difficult with diners trying to make the waitress take their payment, but they have to deal with it.  Feel it out, be a little patient if need be.  Part of being a good server is being able to adjust and stuff.\n\nFood was average - nothing special.  Three stars because the ambiance is just astounding - live jazz music and restaurant is a house, literally.\n\ndmo out	0
Coming from the northeast, me and Cajun anything were not acquainted until I came to the Cajun Queen. Most Cajun food is not vegan friendly, but the chef at Cajun Queen went the extra mile and created me a veg-friendly dish! I had a Creole sauce mixed with a TON of veggies and served with rice on the side.\n\nThe atmosphere is what sells me on the Cajun Queen, an intimate setting that is laid out in a big house. Upstairs has jazz music, while downstairs has a bunch of little tables for small parties.\n\nI'll definitely be back! Cajun/Creole is definitely a different type of food than what I usually grab.	1
BBQ shrimp...\nFried oysters...\nRBR...\n\nAll brilliant.	1
"I don't usually go for Cajun, but there's so much here that there's always something I'm \""in the mood\"" for.  Plenty of food, so good value for the prices.  Service was fair, and probably the only thing that could be improved upon.  \nBest shrimp and grits ever!!"	1
Definitely one of my favs. Loved the gumbo, grits, and creole shrimp. Live jazz was the cherry on the sundae. Speaking of desserts, I remember being pleasantly surprised with the bourbon pecan pie.	1
Awesome etouffee.  It actually isn't as spicy as I thought it'd be.  I got the shrimp, chicken, and crawfish combo.  Actually wish i didn't get the chicken (even though it was super tender), I just didn't get as much rice...which probably would have been really good with the sauces.  Other than that....pretty cool music by local musicians....great ambiance and good times.  =)\n\nIf work sends me back out here again, I wouldn't mind coming back...	1
Terribly busy during the weekend evenings and the service seems to suffers. But not their fault because they seem to overbook themselves to the point of having customers wait for a while at the upstairs bar. We waited about 20 minutes for a reservation to be ready. The bar was packed and had only one bartender, so it was also very slow.\n\nThat said, the food was really AMAZING. Best Cajun place outside of New Orleans, by far. Definitely worth a visit. The Diane and Etoufee dishes are really great. Went there again on a Sunday afternoon and the service was much better.\n\nThe drinks are outstanding too!	1
This has got to be the most overrated restaurant in Charlotte. I've been 3 times and I have never been impressed.  But this last time was horrible. This is the McDonald's of Cajun cuisine. Every dish we had was completely flavorless. Fortunately it was only half price because of the Groupon that I used. And even at half off it was overpriced relative the to the exceptionally low quality of the food. I'll never go back.	0
I went here Friday night as my cheat night for the diet I'm on. This was a great cheat destination! We arrived for reservations at 8:30. The place was packed! They send you upstairs to the bar to wait until your table ready and I did not even try to get a drink it was so packed. However, our table was ready soon after we arrived. Cajun Queen is in an old house in the Elizabeth community (my community) and has great ambiance. We started off with a crawfish appetizer (not the fried one) and it was delicious! I will definitely get tit again! The cucumber gin drink that was featured was also great. I got the BBQ shrimp as my main course and it was also very good. My date got the salmon special and it was great (Maybe a little better than mine, I had to try a bite!) I ended the dinner with a slice of Oreo cheesecake - yum. Overall this was a great experience and will be my destination when I want some great, spicy Cajun cuisine. (sorry Bordeaux - I won't be visiting you anymore)	1
Maybe it's because I've been to New Orleans or have friends from Louisiana but I don't know what the big to do about Cajun Queen is.  Maybe it's because people have never had real Cajun cuisine before.\n\nThe fried green tomatoes were blah.  The batter wasn't tasty at all.  My entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp, chicken and crawfish.  The seasoning was weak.  I must say that the shrimp and chicken were cooked really well.  I just didn't expect a whole chicken breast to be laid over my plate.  The portions were good.\n\nNeither one of my two friends finished their plates.  One said her shrimp and grits were just okay.  My other friend said her fried oysters were fresh.\n\nI will not be going back.  Parking was hard to find and it was loud inside.	0
Had a great dinner here last night in part because of the great deal we got from groupon and the fact that they have a good selection of Abita beers.  \n\nThe shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e and shrimp diane that we got were both quite good, and the service was pretty decent as well.  They forgot a few things, but were nice people at least.   The location is pretty nice and we were able to take a walk around the block afterwards to help digest (why the hell is 7th street totally paved over into some 5 lane highway... slow down people).\n\nHaving just gone to New Orleans a few months ago, I'm glad that Charlotte has a place to get  this type of food, although it's still not perfectly on point.\n\nLive Jazz never hurts (but if you sit downstairs you won't be able to see it and probably can't hear it too well either).	1
I have been to this place plenty of times. I have always had good meals and service. But tonight was bad. I went ther with my wife's work friends. We sat at the bar tables and had a bartender named Bo(very red hair)   We had About 8 people and he insisted that if we sit at the tables we have to order food, which we had planned to do. He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was Friday and happy hour, so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us, until it came time to pay the bill, then he was really nice(tip time! Overall the food is good there, but Bo did not make it a pleasant experience. Smile Bo, it will get you far in life!	0
What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:)	1
We took our daughter there for her birthday a while ago, per her request.  We had a good group with us, but unfortunately they sat us upstairs right next to the band, which made it very difficult for conversation among all of us.  We've eaten our way through New Orleans a couple of times, but this, to me, was not quite up to par.  Especially at $15-$20 a plate.  I've been here twice, and unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back.  Fun atmosphere, great service, and yes, it would be a good date night.  But not a good group night.	0
Had dinner here on the night of Feb 28th. The restaurant is in a converted old house. We tied a few of the appetizers. All very good. I had the Etouffee with all 3 options, Chicken, Shrimp and Crawfish. Very good. I am looking forward to the chance to go here again.	1
Food was very good! Certainly not a creole expert, but felt very authentic.  Certainly beats any others Cajun places in Charlotte. \n\nService was friendly, was in a cute little Elizabeth house. \n\nOnly complaint was the seating was tight. Put four tables where three should have gone. \n\nOverall, I would go back and recommend it to a friend!	1
I do not understand the hype about this place. Everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre. I did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable. I got the shrimp Diane which I'm pretty sure was just shrimp, mushrooms, white rice and chicken broth. Thank God I only went bc I had a groupon.	0
Went there for the 1st time- heard its like new orleans food. Nice and spicy which im not a huge fan of spicy but i tried their chicken diane and ate the whole thing! Good portion for price!!!\n\nSat in the sunroom with only a few tables filled was a great atmosphere with a few friends. they have their own parking lot so its easy access. Theyre always on groupon too!	1
So thankful we made reservations here, folks were waiting at least 35 plus on a Saturday. :) Hostesses were nice. We really appreciated the staff being trained properly. Our server was personable, knowledgeable of the menu&gave good recommendations. He also did not hover. Cool and he got an A from us. We really enjoyed our drinks (get Planters Punch), salads, Shrimp etoufee' and Chicken Diane. We were unimpressed with BBQ shrimp's flavor. The broth was wonderful for dipping the ( cold) bread, yet the shrimp had no flavor. Maybe they can marinate the shrimp with the broth instead of just dropping them in?Also, the bread pudding was just okay. We figured the bourbon&peaches would pack a punch. The seating is tight like others point out, but manageable. Prices match well with portion sizes aka we did not feel cheated. We will definitely  come back for food&drinks only. We will then pickup some Mama R's bread pudding for dessert.	1
This was our first visit to this restaurant. It boasts a Louisiana  style menu. However this dish ( cajun platter) lacked any type of cajun spices. You can't serve red beans and rice with no gravy  and consider that to be a  Louisiana style dish. My husband ordered the New York strip and had to put salt on it because there was no flavor. I certainly have had better and I would not visit again. Overrated!	0
"The wife has wanted to try this place for some time now, so when a living social came out, I figured that I would buy one.  Cajun Queen, like many restaurants, has fallen into the category of \""why did it take me so long to try\"".\n\nOur meal was a solid 4 star experience, and it started with great service. Both my bowl of seafood gumbo and crawfish etoufee were full of cajun flavor and spicy, just like I was looking for. The wife got some shrimp as an app and they came with another great spicy sauce.  For her main, it was her standard blackened catfish, which she thoroughly enjoyed, but took half of it home due to the hugeness of the portion. Not being a fan of catfish, I didn't taste it, but rather focused on finishing every last bit of my etoufee.\n\nCajun Queen is definitely a little taste of New Orleans in Charlotte, and we shall return again soon."	1
Service is good. Gumbo was a bit watery and a pinch of salt wouldn't have hurt. Gumbo was fresh. The same tomatoe soupy water they use in the gumbo they also add to my shrimp and grits. Shrimp and andoui sausage  was good but grits its self were under seasoned i.e pinch of salt.	0
My first time eating here will more than likely be my last. Im big on customer service and i did not like the fact that when i got up to go use the rest room i returned just to have the rest of my food thrown away and after i asked the manager if i could get 5 shrimp like i had he said sorry my food got thrown away but it would be $2 per shrimp if i wanted more. I had just spent $30 there and that was totally wrong, that really put a sour taste in my mouth and i will not be a returning customer!	0
Once again the food is great, and atmosphere is awesome! However, the server and food runner or the guy refill drinks are so so....\n\nWe tried the crawfish popcorn, dinner special sirloin steak with crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, and crawfish and shrimp creole. They are very good, especially the dinner special.	1
I had dinner here last night for the first time.  I ordered the Bayou Platter it was amazing.  I will definitely go back for the good and the jazz.	1
My fiance and I went to Cajun Queen one night as a date night.  I was not impressed by the food nor the ambiance.  We booked a late night dinner due to his schedule  and when we arrived, the jazz band was already on break.  We were seated but our waitress appeared to not to want to be there.  I ordered the New Orleans ice tea and my fiance ordered sweet tea, it took a while before the drinks were delivered and let me tell you - It wasn't nothing to brag about.  The food was spicy not flavorful, just spicy.  Even the couple beside us was a little perplexed about it just being spicy (a little eavesdropping).  Needless, to say not a great experience.  So fortunate that I was able to get a group-on discount and not pay for a $70 experience that I didn't enjoy.  I wouldn't return or recommend this place.	0
I mainly visit the bar at CQ and I can only come up with positive comments. Bo, the bartender, is great. He remembers my name and drink choices. That is very wonderful. I highly recommend either dining upstairs or taking out. Very fine.	1
They Lack favor in their food. I ordered the gumbo it lacked favor and good ingredients. it was not good. The popcorn crawfish were so delicious but covered in a mayo based sauce that should be served on the side. I didn't like seeing the stations for busing dishes right as you got to the top of stairs. It has potential but think the chef needs to take a hard look at his food. \n\nI want to love this place but the food is not executed well at this time.	0
Very nice place!  Recommended as a good date night place by a coworker. Our bill plus 3 drinks was about $87 including tip. They accept reservations and offer valet parking. The wait staff was very friendly.  Our waiter suggested a few nice bars in the area - which we appreciated because we are not familiar with the Charlotte area. \n\nWe enjoyed the food and the ambiance.  My wife ordered the blackened chicken and she thought it was great...great flavor and juicy.  The portions were perfect.  We also enjoyed their pecan pie and key lime pie...both quite tasty. \n\nThe meal was excellent the server was excellent also!  \n\nWe will definitely visit again...	1
In Charlotte for a quick business trip, I found this gem on Yelp. My waitress Hanna seemed genuinely excited that this was my first time there and recommended several dishes, all of which didn't disappoint. Started with the BBQ shrimp, spicy yet tasty; sop the sauce with the bread. Next up, blackened pork tenderloin with fried plantains. 3 good sized medallions with an interesting bean chorizo sauce. The plaintains were battered with cornmeal and were very good. I also asked for a single filet of the salt and pepper catfish, which was very good also. Ended the meal with key lime pie. Overall the dining experience went well. I would come back next time in town to try other menu items.	1
My girlfriend and I tried this out on a whim based on reviews from Yelp and it was very tasty! I feel like the quality of food and the presentation, don't quite match the prices that they are charging, but they had a great crowd and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves! I would definitely go there again.	1
Cajun Queen is pretty much always good. What's not to like about Cajun food? All of the classics are here. The restaurant is located right in the Elizabeth area in a converted house. There are lots of fun legends about the house being haunted. I know they also do live jazz, though I'm unsure of what night. Regardless, you may want to make a reservation before visiting. It's always busy.\n\nLast night, we ordered fried green tomatoes, fried oysters, Cajun pasta, and the steak special. (It was a make-up Father's Day dinner.) All were fabulous. The oysters and the pasta were my favorites and the tomatoes were my least - though, still decent. My only gripe is that it is a little over priced. The portions are large and the quality is good so it's probably justified. \n\nParking blows.	1
If your in Charlotte definitely make your way to Cajun Queen, highly recommend making a reservation you will be seated quickly and highly recommend using there complimentary valet parking you just have to tip the guys, great New Orleans Cajun/creole style food in Charlotte, their Sunday brunch is awesome as well!!!!	1
I absolutely love the food here. With the perfect mix of fresh, delicious cajun food and eclectic decor in an old, historic house turned restaurant, you really can't go wrong. The parking can be a pain on weekend evenings and the quarters can be quite tight, for these reasons I typically visit Cajun Queen on weekday nights. The fried oysters are my favorite - and I typically don't do fried!	1
I'm a huge fan of the food here! It's by far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. However, I will say that the gumbo shouldn't be called gumbo.  It's a tomato based semi broth with rice and shrimp. Very bland. Not a traditional gumbo by any means. Also, I can't remember the last time I've had good service in this place. From what I understand most of those employees have been there for a long time. It's like they have no respect that we are there dining and they forget that we're the ones who tip.  Lastly, that music upstairs! I can't stand it. It's so loud. I took some family there that were visiting from out of town and we were sat upstairs in that room with the band and we couldn't have a conversation the whole time. It's ridiculous. I recommend making reservations and firmly request to be seated down stairs.  With that being said I can never choose my dinner in this place. Everything (Except for the gumbo) is amazing! The mahi mahi is exceptional. Definitely worth the bad service :)	1
Everyone in our party of 3 thoroughly enjoyed their meal. Sat on their outdoor patio which was very pleasant should the weather permit. Would definitely return.	1
So incredibly let down by this dining experience. Our waiter was simultaneously overbearing and absent-minded. Half of our table got their meals 10-15 mins before the other half and the waiter forgot to bring two of us our desserts. Meanwhile, the food was terrible. The fried green tomatoes lacked any kind of seasoning and the crawfish etouffee was bland and not at all spicy. The tollhouse cookie pie was also a travesty. How does one mess up a cookie pie?! At least the key lime pie was good, but not worth the $250 dollar bill :(	0
We had to visit Charlotte's best cajun joint before we headed home to NYC. 4 stars for the haunted black magic atmosphere of the restaurant. Even in broad daylight, the dining hall had a dark shrouded vibe going on. The beignets let me down a little bit but the shrimp & grits more than made up for it. The fried popcorn shrimp was also very well done but the highlight for me was the shrimp & grits.	1
This place is great. It looks small on the outside but it's gigantic on the inside. Very quaint and reminiscent of an abode in the French quarter. I had the popcorn crawfish and the red beans and rice here. Both dishes were awesome. The pop corn crawfish was meaty and had a slight hint of spice to it not salty or anything. Let's not talk about the sweet tea. That was just marvelous. Not too sweet. It was just right.	1
Cajun Queen serves up consistent cajun food in a fun environment.  It's not exactly what you would find dining out in NOLA, and it's a bit pricey for what you get, but if you have a craving, it will fix that.\n\nThe one thing that makes Cajun Queen stand out is the rooftop dining.  It's a great place on a nice night.  There is also live jazz in the upstairs dining section.  \n\nWord of warning - if you order a cocktail, you only need one.  ;)	1
"Do not waste your money! The gumbo tasted like the roux had burned and there was no salt whatsoever. I ordered the blackened chicken to be safe thinking \""no one can mess up blackened chicken\"".....I was wrong. None of the food (including the blackened chicken) were seasoned with salt and pepper. This was the most bland, overpriced food I'd ever had in the city. I ordered my toddler the chicken strip little gators meal. The fries were the best thing out of the entire meal. The service was as also dry and not very friendly or inviting from the hostess to the waiter, Brandon. Geez, I know it's a Tuesday night (we arrived at 5:30) but at least show some enthusiasm as I arrive to spend a whopping $123 (4 entrees, 4 alcoholic bevs, 1 kids meal) on a below average meal. It would've been more had we been charged for the uneaten cup of gumbo."	0
Have been there a few times and they never disappoint!  The Jambalaya is second to none.  Perfectly spiced and portioned.  The New Orleans BBQ is also excellent.  Great atmosphere and service.	1
I'd probably give 3 1/2 if I could but I'm going to give 4 stars for excellent service... love the live music every night, great drinks, outdoor patio.  I like the old house. It feels like going over an old family members house but better. \nThe food was good overall.  Appetizers Bbq shrimp sauce is great with bread and the Crawfish ceviche was flavorful and spicy!  So when my gumbo came it tasted blah to me. Not very flavorful.  So my dad ate it and liked it. My shrimp and grits were ok but the shrimp was bland and the skin on my sausage was hard. My sister had the dish several times before and said it didn't taste the same. Liked the grits though. tasted the blackened catfish... moist and delicious. Tasty desserts, but nothing to write home about. I do think it's a bit overpriced. \n\nThe restroom paper towel machine was broken. And no other dryer or towels available. I know is out of their control but maybe need a backup.  It's quite annoying.\n\nGreat place for appetizers, live jazz and drinks.	1
"Food was tasty but the seating could be more comfortable to a point of wanting to hang out for a bit to listen to music and have some drinks. Wait staff are very nice a knowledgable about the menu. Highly recommend the \""Shrimp and Crawfish\"" app to start and \""7th St. Stumbler\"" as you drink. Do the complimentary valet parking sons not to have parking issues."	1
Having been to NOLA and experiencing the amazing food scene it's hard to imagine anywhere outside of LA being able to match the quality of food; however, this restaurant is awesome.  The etouffe was spot on, shrimp and grits creamy, the Cajun popcorn was a delightful surprise and the scampi unlike any other ever tried. \n\nGreat place to celebrate or just enjoy a great taste of new Orleans.	1
I take everyone that comes to visit me to Cajun Queen!  From the great food (my favorite is the bbq shrimp and bread to dip into the sauce), to the live jazz and great service, this is a restaurant not to be missed!	0
Food is always great and service is good! Best brunch in Charlotte. My son loves the beignets and they sell out quick...	1
Very loud, bad service, and the food doesn't met the expectations. We came w a party of 10 people, we didn't even get menus for a while, it was so loud we could hardly listen to our server. Dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time. Super disappointed	0
The owner could care less about customers. He is the rudest man. The food is so so. Nothing Cajun about it. They did not use our Groupon correctly. That was fine with us, but why couldn't the server tell us. Not just toss the bill on the table and walk away. Save your money and dine elsewhere. The Cajun Yard Dog is far better, and far more Cajun cuisine.	0
best fried chicken in charlotte.	1
First-timer and I ordered fried chicken to go.  My plan was to head home, take the meal out of the container, lay it all out on a nice plate and leisurely make my way through the chicken, mac and cheese and cabbage.  You know - like a normal person.  But NOOOO!\n\nSigh.  I got in the car and started driving when the smell of the chicken completely overwhelmed me.  I could not help myself. One hand on the wheel, the other digging around in the box pulling off random pieces of chicken to eat.  So good!  Seriously, I couldn't stop myself.  I'd like to say I didn't rip open the cellophane covering the plastic fork at the red light just so I could taste the sides, but I'd be telling an untruth.  Yep, I did that too.  Next time I'll try to pace myself.\n\nThanks Chicken Box for making sure you added a couple of napkins to the bag. I needed them.  Really, really good chicken!	1
You have to look past the appearance to have a great experience here. You won't find a lot of  frills and stereo typical sit down restaurant decor, but man do they have something more important, FLAVOR!  I used to think that an uptown diner had the best fried chicken in town but, i was mistaken. I got a two piece white with two sides. The chicken breasts where ridiculously juicy  The mac and cheese reminded me of the extra fattening goodness that only someone that learned a recipe that has stood the test of time. \n\nThey have fried everything and I love it.  If you want something good off the grid then stop by the chicken box and enjoy the south at its best.	1
I'm not sure about the area this place is in since I'm new in town, but the food is amazing. I had fried chicken and it was the best I've ever had. Even the side items were good. They had things like Chittlins, Pig Feet, Oxtails, stuff you don't find anywhere else.	1
"Well, this was only my second visit to the chicken box and.both times I left with a fullness in the stomach and an air of satisfaction. The fried chicken was second to none, and once a complement of hot sauce was applied,  heavenly. The collards and corn bread was hot, well seasoned, delicious. I had to dip a fork into the candied yams and should note that the only disappointment there was that I ate them all so quickly  there was no more.  \n\nThis is a rather simple setting, not my \"" take a date and impress her\"" on the esthetic, but if she is just looking for some good, near down home cooking that would leave you with a burp and a smile, this could be the place......"	1
"Having a taste for some soul food and reading the previous reviews, the family went there for dinner last night. I had high hopes for the quality but I was disappointed. The sign said, \""for when you miss ya mama's cooking\"" but I have to confess, my mother did not prepare macaroni and cheese with velveeta, nor did she make candied yams from canned sweet potatoes. . And that struck me right away. The cornbread was good, although a bit dried, giving me the impression that they were from a day earlier or so. The tilapia was well seasoned and so were the chicken wings, although both were a bit heavy-headed on the salt. I felt like this place was \""the place to go\"" back in the day, but the home cooked soul food has clearly corners cut and that impacted that slow cooked taste that soul food usually renders."	0
This place hits the spot on a Sunday afternoon! \n\nLike the previous reviews have mentioned if you're looking for hot, fresh well seasoned soul food...this is your place! \n\nI ordered the three wing dinner with pinto beans and rice and cabbage. The chicken came out pipping hot and was very well seasoned! I was hoping the wings would be a bit larger but overall they tasted delicious! Both the rice and beans and cabbage were delicious! \n\nI'm looking forward to trying several more sides including the  mac and cheese, broccoli and cheese casserole and collard greens. And of course I want more of that fried chicken!	1
Exceeded my expectations! I had the fried chicken. It was tender and not greasy. The yams were tasty. Sweet but not overbearing. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the area!	1
Greasy overpriced food. Mac and cheese boring, bland, no flavor . Yams were   from the can. Chicken livers were  fried hard in old smelly grease, that stank up my whole car.  . Cake dry boring I dont believe it was home made.  . Umimpressed and disappointed,  I won't eat here again.  Its  definitely not like momma makes it.	0
I stopped by the Chicken Box to grab lunch today.  I hadn't been there for a long time, and I was really excited about getting some of their fried chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  \nWhen I pulled into the parking lot I noticed a big sign hanging down from the roof proclaiming that the original owners were back and it was under new management.  \n\nI hate to say it, but the original owners have really messed up a good thing.  \n\nWhen I went inside the huge menu board that listed all the amazing soul food side dishes were gone.  \n\nI guess the new management is trying to just rip off Price's by having the only side dish be mediocre coleslaw and bad tater tots.  \n\nThe real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe.  \n\nDoes anyone know where the old managers went?  I need more of there home cooking.  This new chicken box cafe is terrible.	0
This is no longer The Chicken Box Cafe.  Old owners or new owners, it wasn't very good. The fried chicken wasn't crispy or seasoned like before. They were out of Mac and Cheese!!! Where I used to come in and place my order and go, this time others got their food before me and I had to ask where my order was.  Very disappointed.	0
The original owners are back with the OLD name Chicken Box, menu as changed.  It was empty when i arrived around 6 pm.  Half of the menu was handwritten and taped on the front of the registers, and some of the menus items were not listed but in the system (i.e kids plates, you have to ask.  I ordered chicken breast dinner with two sides and kids plate with one drum stick, i had to order another for a dollar, mac&cheese, onions rings are a side but extra.  It cost $17.00 (1 chicken breast/2 drums sticks.  It took approx. 25 minutes.  \n\nOne more thing I forgot..THE CHICKEN BREAST tasted like it was dropped into a bowl of SALT, very high sodium content.	0
"I came here on my lunch break at work, because it is right up the road.  They have an ecelectic menu for lunch, with a lot of gyros.  I decided on the fish gyro and called it in.  It was ready within seven minutes or so, not bad at all.  A couple of my coworkers and I came to the store together to pick it up.  The line was almost out the door, it seems really popular for people who work around here.  Honestly though I think it is just because there aren't many other choices around here.  \n\nWhen we got up to the counter a waitress asked the cashier, \""Did they give you a tip?\""  We thought she was joking so we laughed.  \""Seriously,\"" she replied.  Wow, how rude!  Not to mention my fish gyro was dry and I had to load it up with tartar sauce, thank god I was really hungry."	0
I recently brushed a road cone and damaged the paint job my Honda Accord (near the right head light which was also damaged).  I took the car to Body Works Plus for an estimate.  Some of streaks looked bad enough to warrant a repaint of the area and a new headlight,\n\nRather than push an expensive repaint, I was advised to go with the less expensive option (buffing).  I was very happy with the advice and the result.  The car ended up looking good as new (and no need for a new headlight).  They even washed the car down.\n\nThe employees took the time to answer my (many and repeated) questions - and I was given rides to and from the local bakery (Amelie's Bakery) for the duration of the repairs.  Rental cars (and free loaners when available) are also an option.\n\nMy experience was positive and I will go again should I have more car issues.	1
When I had a tree fall on my car I was in between work contracts and insurance wouldn't cover all of the damages. By some sort of I was refereed to BWP. After talking with the owner, Brian, most of my worries were over. He was very reasonable about getting my car fixed up all the way for a price that was within my insurance limit.\n\nThanks to BWP, my car looks brand new, just like it did before a tree fell on and I don't have to take the bus to my new job! The customer care his above and beyond that of any body shop I have been to before.	1
This place is the ONLY place in CLT for quality body work!.. Great work ethic, quality people, honest pricing and great customer service!  Our daughter's car was fixed in two days and looked superb when returned.  Body Works Plus is the genuine real deal!	1
Nobody wants to be doing business at a body shop for the most part but these folks make it a pleasure. You get text updates on the status of your vehicle and they work with insurance to make the process painless. Don't hesitate to get your work done here if your car gets a boo-boo	1
Honestly, I love america for businesses like this. These guys do a phenomenal job at what they do, just amazing. Service is quick, knowledgable and incredibly courteous. they know what they are doing. they are open saturdays. i drive out of my way to go there, and its just  a dry cleaner. also they do all the work on premises, which i think is a good thing.	1
Best dry cleaners in Charlotte!	1
Too expensive. Go to the clears in the wells fargo buiding uptown	0
If you need a wash dry and fold place head to Kim's on Monday. It's $1.00 per pound. Perfect for a busy family that can use some help. Drop off and pick up the same day. Love this place and highly recommend it.	1
Just witnessed a most sexist and unfair firing of a waitress in front of other customers. The owner was rude to other customers who tried to come to her aid. He said he lost a regular because she brought him the wrong tea. He lost a lot more regulars because of his public display of anger.	0
My favorite Breakfast and Lunch place in Charlotte where the food is downhome country cooking with a very friendly and helpfull staff.	1
Good BBQ? Please......\nChicago style? Well, maybe.... \nOnly if you are from Chicago and you prepared it.\nIt should be called SAM's style. As in SAM's Club. \nOk, heres the layout. I ordered a Rack of ribs, Mac & cheese, Greens, Cole slaw, and potato salad.\n\nRack of ribs: I received a full rack( i give them that). But it was a mixed rack..... baby backs and a spare ribs. What is that called? \n\nMac & cheese: So, so.\nGreens: Unseasoned, strait from the can. ( at least they could have sprinkled a lil' salt & pepper on 'em) Ya know?!?!?\nCole slaw: Strait from a plastic container. \nPotato salad: Need I say more.....?!?!?\n\nBuilding: Dirty inside and out...\nSanitation Grade: 90.1\n\nTwo words...... Keep Driving!	0
RIB TIPS didnt have taste	0
The have some of the best ribs and rib tips in Charlotte. Tea and lemonade made fresh.	1
All I saw was drugs dealing fights! This place is a big joke! They should shut this place down! Rooms for the inn they give you a place to sleep eat and shower and they talk about god what to know your story! Than go on to say money is bad but the people saying in jumping in to benz high dollar cars funny bullshit here it made me think of PTL telling you shut this place down!	0
I went to the Charlotte Ballet Theatre to see One Voice Chorus, so I am not reviewing the company, just the structure itself.\nThe building has a nice reception area, perfect for mingling and having a drink before the show.  Unfortunately, the folks at One Voice Chorus didn't have the ticket areas (admission, drinks, etc) clearly marked, so that was a bit confusing.  But, that doesn't reflect badly on the building itself.\nThe seats are terraced for optimum viewing and relatively comfortable.  The temperature was within normal limits (neither too hot or too cold).\nThe restrooms are spacious with automated everything.\nPerhaps my next visit will be to see the Charlotte Ballet itself!	1
I've been here quite a few times. (Honestly because it's very near my house) on 2 or 3 occasions,  they've left something out of my order or had me drive up and wait. They're usually pretty slow.in the drive thru. Lesson:: triple check the order while still at the window and don't go here in a hurry. (More than 1 car can't be dealt with at a time)	0
Victory Lane is a fun place to challenge your racing skills and your friends.  \n\nI feel an 8 minute race is just a tease, but my friends who don't have a regular exercise regimen start complaining after the second race...  \n\nNot all cars are set up the same.  Some folks complain about this, but I feel the perceived handicap is a disguised opportunity for me to learn how to overcome issues while on the track.  \n\nVictory Lane has many offerings in the form of endurance races and seasonal leagues when open lapping is not challenging enough for you.  I have not personally participated in any of these events, but hope to in 2014.\n\nOccasionally you will see a nice car in the parking lot, which I have come to expect at venues catering to motorsports.	1
Loved it!\n\nI know NOTHING about go karting, cars, engines but my boyfriend who loves stuff like that brought me here for date night. We came around 10:45pm on Friday night. They had a running special so the boyfriend paid full price and my cost of entry was only $5. The workers were EXTREMELY helpful. Since we came so late, we were the only people there (excluding the group at the food area) so we had the track for ourselves. \n\nOne thing I really like is that you sign up and register upon entry and they automatically send you your race times and place number to your email along with giving you a print out. \n\nI had the best date night ever coming here.	1
We had a great Time at a team event. however one of our teammates was hurt pretty bad.I also hit a wall fairly hard and hurt my neck.The staff should recommend the use of the available neck pads to help avoid these type injuries.\nBe very aware of the risk of injury before you do this. It is about the same as playing football with a high school football team.	1
Came in for a private party and had a blast! They let us girls do our own round, which was nice since the guys can be a bit aggressive. The staff answered our questions and were very accommodating. The food for our party was surprisingly good. The carts are well maintained and very very fast. I've never been on a course like this. Might be more suited for teenagers and adults.	1
Small station.  Outdated for the volume of traffic handled.     But a nice gentleman volunteer opens the door for you.	0
"Took Amtrak from Durham to Charlotte to see the Panther/Saints game. On the return trip we were stopped by a broken down N&S freight train on the single track around High Point. We didn't move for an hour and a half. Several weeks later I took the train to see the Panthers/49ers play.  The return trip was delayed because earlier in the day the train had run over two people in Durham and Greensboro. We were supposed to leave Charlotte at 5:15. By 6:30 they couldn't tell us any status about when the train would arrive. \""Could be 8. Could be 9. It might never show up.\"" I had to spend the night in Charlotte and catch the next morning's train. On the return we were 15 mins outside of Durham when the train came to a halt. There was a sensor issue that had to be investigated. Never, ever will I use Amtrak."	0
Nathan Fish did my boyfriend's tattoo and it turned out amazing. We were there for about 5 hours and had nothing short of a good time. We had no trouble setting up an appointment and consultation. \n\nThe fee was 100$ an hour. We were booked at 1:00 and he didn't start tattooing till 2:00, I believe another appointment went over, but we were out by 6:00p and only paid $300. \n\nI suggest Fu's to anyone looking to get a tattoo, there are photos of each artist's style on their website.	1
Brought a rough sketch in and gave it to Jake.  A few days later when I came in for my appt I was amazed.  Jake had taken my sketch and made it ten times better and cleaner looking.  The actual process was quick and painless and it looks awesome.  I would definitely recommend Fu's and Jake.	1
Thank you Fu Tattoo for completely ruining my husbands tattoo. What was once two initials with a heart is now one big blob. If you can't do a touch up on a customer you need to tell them. Awful. I will make sure to add a picture so everyone can see the work you clowns do.	0
My girlfriend and I just had great experience with Travis at fu's.   We both experienced him listening to what we wanting, excution was excellent and place was pristine.	1
I agree with other reviewers that this is a great value. I stayed here for 6 days during a recent work trip and because I have stayed at other Homewoods in the past. \n\nEach room us a suite equipped with a small kitchen, living room and bedroom. The beds are very comfortable with plenty of pillows. There is also a TV in each room. There is a workout room with a couple of ellipticals and treadmills with TVs on each. I love that. Breakfast is free and also they have a featured dinner with free beer and wine. I don't typically eat the dinner but like to bring a glass of wine back to the room. \n\nI believe they also do a free shuttle to the airport but I had a rental car. The only thing I found annoying was that there were only like 8 hangers. Being there for a week, it would have been nice to have more to hang my pressed work clothes on. Other than that, this place is a wonderful place to stay.	1
Microwave popcorn and a DVD player in my suite's living room. \n\nCeramic tea cups in the lobby coffee stand. \n\nNeutrogena soaps. \n\nAfter 3 weeks in small towns, I feel like I'm in heaven.	1
"So so.  It was the smaller things that SHOUTED \""cheap & low quality\""\nCrappy hair dryer.  Holes burned in comforter.  Ratty toilet seat.  Stayed one night in 2 bedroom unit.  Liked the layout - 2 bedrooms - each with a bathroom.  Living room and kitchen between."	0
Eh... It's quick, it's fast, it's cheap, and it's greasy.  Honestly there really isn't anything else to say besides that they have a crazy variety.  They do offer a nice daily lunch special, too.  This is one of my shortest reviews because, honestly, that is all you need to know.  NO to the pulled pork and YES to the fish and chips.  Somewhat Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M.	0
Awful service. Cold burger. Forgot my onion rings. Rude people overall. I do not understand why this place gets any business at all.	0
I've only ever changed planes at CLT, but this is as good an airport as any to spend time between flights. Generally, it's spacious, modern, clean, and easy to navigate. Specifically, the atrium between concourses B and C, the two US Airways terminals, is delightful. \n\n-Floor-to-ceiling windows with a sunny southern exposure of natural light\n-Quaint white-painted rocking chairs for sitting in the sunny windows (and functional -- a rocking chair is really relaxing!)\n-A huge, clean food court with Starbucks, TCBY, Burger King, Quiznos, Chili's, Pizza Hut, Freshens, Mrs. Fields, Cinnabon, BofA ATMs, and a number of local and regional counters including Brookwood Farms Carolina BBQ\n-A business center with available high-speed Internet, conferencing, faxing, copying, etc.\n\nCLT is now the tenth-busiest airport in the country, and getting busier. If you haven't stopped here yet, you will soon. Oh, and don't mind the NASCAR-themed restaurants in concourse B -- there's a California Pizza Kitchen in there, too.\n\nAs I said, I've never parked, checked in or used the baggage claim, so you're on your own there.	1
I wish I could give a minus 5.  This was the most unorganized set up I've seen in a while.  We had to stop here on the way back from Mexico.  It took so long to get through Immigration and Customs, I swear the employees were on some kind of slow motion drugs.  We were about to miss our flight- in fact someone had to call the gate to ask them to wait for us.  When we saw the mile long line for security, we panicked.  I thought if I asked the security man very nicely if we could go to the head, since the plane was waiting, perhaps he would help us.  WRONG!!!  He was the rudest, most ignorant employee I encountered in the entire airport.   We ran our asses off and got to our gate just as they were closing the doors.  Luckily they let us board.  From now on it's non-stop for us!!!	0
"\""Rocking chairs and free wireless.\""  Borrowing from David S. B. [hey it is a great opening.]  Those two things do set this airport apart from others.  The rocking chairs make me think of my grandparent's house at the lake.  They also create an appearance of things are slower here, you don't need to rush to your gate, just take a seat and relax.  Welcome to southern hospitality.   And about the free wi-fi ---- It is not the Southern Way to gouge our guests, we want you to feel at home."	1
Yes, CLT is clean and it's central area connecting the terminals is brightly lit from the wall-o-windows, and offers plenty of eating/shopping options.  I'll give it that.\n\nNow, CLT is USAIRWAYS' fortress hub, meaning they dominate this place.  This is not a good thing being that USAIR tops the list for things like lost and/or mishandled baggage, customer complaints, percentage of flights late 70% of the time or more, and the lowest % of flights arriving on time.  So now you're saying, well that's USAIR's fault, not CLT's. Well, that may be true, but USAIR has the majority of flights, passenger traffic, and gates in the airport so...\n\nOne star for free WiFi.	0
I did not have a great experience in this airport.  I think I came in through Terminal E, and it just reeked of mildew!  I hope that wing is next in line to get renovated.  \n\nOnce I moved towards the center, it was a lot cleaner looking, but I wasn't crazy about the food selection.  Cinnabon, BBQ, pizza with 4 slices of tomato on it and that's it?  It's tough to be a vegetarian in NC, I guess.  And the lines for the food were ghastly!  Anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line.  I guess I could have had a 5,000 calorie cinnamon bun for lunch.\n\nAnd yes, I gave an extra star for free wifi.	0
"I officially curse this airport.  The only thing that keeps me going in the south is Bojangles Chicken n' Biscuits.  My wife's favorite is Carolina style BBQ.  So upon deplanning we check a map to see what fine eating establishments are offered at this airport.  Sadly  we see no Bojangles or BBQ so we settle on nachos, and not even really good nachos.  Upon finishing our \""meal\"" we head over to terminal B and pass by not only a Carolina BBQ but a Bojangles as well.  Thanks Charlotte airport!!  Way to update your signage."	0
The rocking chairs are genius!\n\nThey're perfect for weary travelers that just want to relax especially those of us in between flights. Ahhh genius.\n\nAnd did I mention the food, they have everything you might be craving and some new ideas that will get your mouth watering. \n\nThe staff was polite and helpful. \n\nSome other airports need to come study this airport's success and learn a thing or 20.	1
Yeah, the rocking chairs are a cute touch, but how comfortable do you think they are when you've just flown a red-eye (that was 45 minutes early...thanks a LOT) and have a connecting flight 3 hours later, with the temperature of the place hovering around 45F.   They are not conducive to sleep, happiness or non-terrorist thoughts.\n\nI chose to sleep on the floor...the just shampooed, wet, cold, stinky floor.\n\nI just wanted some sleep, DAMNIT.	0
I've been flying in and out of this airport for more years than I care to think about, so it feels like home each time I'm there to fly, drop someone off or pick someone up.\n\nI remember when Douglas International was much smaller, similar to Greensboro or Raleigh, and have seen it expand quite a bit over the years.\n\nOf course, airports were much more fun back before the tragedy of 9/11. Prior to that, anybody could access the main concourses and the restaurants they have. \n\nNow, with access restricted to only those who have tickets, its much less exciting, but still a very nice airport, especially compared to places like Detroit, O'Hare in Chicago and McCarron in Vegas. \n\nIt's pretty easy to navigate your way, and I love grabbing a beer before a flight at California Pizza Kitchen. \n\nI've had nothing but positive experiences in dealing with the people at Douglas.	1
I like smaller airports, as it seems like you get better customer service when there's less competition and crowds. I've been in and out of this airport for years, both as a Charlotte resident and as a transfer hub, and I've never had a bad experience.\n\nMy favorite airport moment at Charlotte-Douglass was when I returned late one night and had to get to my car, which was parked in the remote lot. I'd spent nearly all my money on the trip, so I was working on a wing and a prayer to be able to pay my fee to get out of the parking lot. \n\nWhen I got my stuff in the car and pulled up to the gate, it was standing open! Nobody was there! It was a Thanksgiving miracle! I drove on out and went home with three dollars still in my wallet!	1
yeah. that's right.  I'm yelping a layover with 4 stars. \n\nCLT knows how to do a layover right! I found myself sitting on a rocking chair in the main terminal atrium, (note: go upstairs on the landing for a little more space and quite) listening to someone play on the grand piano below me, eating frozen yogurt from TCBY's new store called Yovana, and relaaaaaaaxing. And looking around, I was not the only person who seemed a little less stressed  in this tree lined terminal. Everyone seemed to soak in the great amenities and take advantage of the opportunity of able leg room and overhead space! This airport also offers some great food selections and shops so you can stock up on supplies for the next leg of your trip. If I need another layover, I'm booking it through CLT! hell yeah.	1
This was my first time at this airport. It was actually very nice and there are a ton of shops and restaurants to choose from. Like.....a lot! The nice hting is you can go to your gate and probably find a good restaurant right next to the gate so that you don't feel like youre going to miss the flight.\n\nI read another review about the baggage being late. I agree! I came from Jamaica and they let maybe 3 bags on the carousel, then 2 more and that was it for what seemed like forever. Maybe 20 minutes. Then nothing came out for another few minutes. This was maybe the worst part, but everything else was good.	1
If I had to have a layover, this was a nice place for it. Perhaps true to stereotypes of the south, the employees were all very friendly and kind in a way that seemed genuine. The concourses were clean, large and open, and they have ROCKING CHAIRS along the sides to relax in. !! SFO, you should hang your head in shame.	1
My love for this place just keeps going up!\n\nAgain, mouthwash in little cups for me waiting in the restrooms...sigh...lovely!\n\nAmazing restaurant selections and everywhere, yes everywhere, in this place is CLEAN!!!!	1
The airport is bigger than it looks from the outside. Fast check-in at the ticket counter and pretty seamless through the gate. All the employees seemed in a good mood. \n\nThere are lots of places to sit and relax before your flight. Definitely use the moving sidewalks...especially if you are flying out of Gate E. Be prepared to walk a while to get there. \n\nThe baggage claim area has a good system going as long as you familiarize yourself with the zones. You can also easily tell the person that picks you up which zone you'll be at on the outside. \n\nConvenient and organized airport! Yay CLT!	1
I can't stand this airport.  They put all of the feeder flights at the opposite end of the airport from the longer run flights making it a 1/2 to 3/4 mile jog.  The food court is the best part of this airport, the US Air clubs aren't bad either, free alcohol!\n\nThe US Air passenger service agents are complete jerks.  I can say that as I used to work for US AIr and actually tried to help people.	0
ITS HUGE.  yes thats what she said.  I feel like I walk for days.  Thank god for all the comfortable rocking chairs everywhere so that I can have a kip by the window while I wait for my layover.\n\nAlso they happen to have a plethora of healthy food options.  Not just auntie annes, and cinnabon.  I found a fantastic smoothie place next to a fresh text mex place in the US air terminal.  Prices are good considering its the south.\n\nWhen I flew out of here to go to Paris, the experience was seamless, and reminded me of leaving from JFK.  (internationally is far superior than my experiences at Logan).  \n\nThis wouldnt be my first choice airport to connect to, but the power supplies are abundant, and the food choices are endless.  If you get laid over, its not such a bad place to wind up.\n\n\nOh FREE wifi too.  :)	1
Had a layover here recently coming in from an international destination. Customs wasn't too bad, basically waved us through. But we had to exit to the main terminal and re-go thru security, which is freaking insane! We had an 80 minute lay over and I think we only got to the plane with 20 minutes to spare - they were already boarding. ugh!	0
Pretty nice airport.  We were only there for 2 short layovers, but we did have the opportunity to try Bojangles chicken (late night....flight delayed) - it tasted good at the time!  Like the rocking chairs too--seems other people really enjoy them as there was rarely one open.	1
"For a \""Small\"" airport, CDI sure does make a killing. It has to be one of the busiest airports on the east coast just because it services US Airways, like fo real.\n\nSome Drawbacks:\n-Only 3 security checkpoints\n-Continental's 2 gates are about the farthest from the checkpoint\n-Daily parking shuttle seems like it comes once every half hour.\nThat's about it.\n\nWhy I don't mind it:\n-Cheap daily parking\n-Delicious BBQ stand inside\n-Checkpoint lines tend to get long, but move real fast.\n-$25 cab ride from uptown.\n-Drive thru the hood to get there.\n\nCDI gets two thumbs up from this guy. Just move the continental gate closer please!!!!"	1
OMG this is the slowest AIRPORT i have been to in the last 12 months.\n\nI have been in to 15 different Airports in the US in the last 12 months.	0
Oh goodness I have spent a LOT of time in this airport. Living in New Orleans means flying through other cities with bigger airports quite often, and Charlotte-Douglas International is one of the nicer ones that I get to frequent. \nThis airport is pretty large, but has moving sidewalks that help you get a little boost while going from terminal to terminal. The entire place is clean and sparkly, like new. There are many shops including food options, toy stores, etc. I think there is any type of store that you could want. \nSo, if you're stuck in North Carolina with a long layover you can have a great meal, do some shopping, and then cuddle up in one of the rocking chairs and just enjoy yourself before you get on your plane.	1
What a cluster	0
This is actually one of my favorite airports...especially if you have a lot of time to kill between flights. There are great food options all over the airport, plus a really beautiful atrium with dozens of rocking chairs where you can take a load off and people watch for a while. The business center is great in a pinch, too!	1
CLT you are always clean and pretty and fabulous! The bags are usually up in a reasonable amount of time, no issues ever. Joy was the day CLT turned non-smoking! \n\nI love the Shuttle Personnel who never want you to wait for a shuttle. Both long term and short term parking shuttles wait at the same spot. If the CLT Parking Attendant sees you waiting, they will always come over and make sure the short bus you need is on the way! Thanks guys!! You are super duper!!	1
I love this airport.  Lots of great shopping while you wait.  The layout is easy enough.  It's clean and the people offer plenty of southern hospitality.  My favorite thing to do is people watch and from the cozy rocking chair in the busy corrider well.  \n\nI do want to make note that if you park in daily.  You need to ride the shuttle to and from the terminal.  The shuttle line was huge so I thought I could just walk to daily.  I wound up in hourly thinking someone stole my car.  The signs in the deck just say east or west not daily vs hourly.  Don't worry after an hour and 2 calls to the airport police the nice folks helped me load my bags on the shuttle I should have taken an hour ago.  Lesson learned on patience.	1
NIce little southern hospitality airport. I like the rockers they have so you can se the goings on outside. The only drawback is that southerners for the most part should watch the southern food there are way too many golf carts going up and down the halls transporting people who don't necessarily need it, they should be walking to get rid of the excess girth.	1
Charlotte-Douglas is a fairly nice, yet huge, airport.  Dining options are varied, and this airport has a lot to see and do during layovers.\n\nRocking Chairs are a huge plus :-D	1
They have the best USO i have ever been to. \n\nThe rocking chairs are great to sit and people watch, and this place is always clean!	1
My connecting flight back to San Francisco was at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport which was cool because my walk to the terminal was less than 2 minutes and the airport was really clean. I still prefer Texas connecting flights since flying across from East coast to West isn't fun. I hate sitting on a plane for more than a few hours but as long I reached my destination I'm good and on time.	1
This is the first time I have been compelled to review an airport but after reading in a clearly biased US Airways magazine that this airport won a best airport award. I couldn't help myself. This is the worst airport layout ever. Basically, it is the Pontiac Aztec of airports.	0
This airport was pretty cool. Until... Going through that TSA x-ray scanning and pat down! This service should have included four star dining and drinks before hand. \n\nBefore I head back to the West Coast, I was craving for some Bojangles Chicken. Luckily I had a two hour gap before my flight. I was walking from terminal A to terminal B. I literally had walk a mile and a half to get to the only Bojangles in the airport. \n\nP.S. - CLT please add at least one Bojangles in each terminal. Thank you.	0
It's freakin' huge. If you have connections, you better leave at least :30 minutes between them. At least they have people movers to speed things up, and free wifi if you get to your gate with any time to spare.	1
Easy in and out, love that part! TSA security is the worst. No help, no smiles, to slow, don't care. No preferred line.\n\nGenerally a dirty airport (delta terminal). All the food courts are at one end of the terminal, so you have to walk from one end to the other just to get a cup of coffee or bite to eat!\n\nIt seems that people in this airport have two speeds slow and stop! Very frustrating if your on business, if your on a golf vacation you'd probably love it!	0
I would give this place a 3 if the organization of the parking lots/interior was better and if there wasn't someone standing in the bathroom making me uncomfortable when I have to go to the bathroom while I'm waiting for a flight.\n\nFor the amount of air traffic that goes through this airport, I'm disappointed. The lines for security generally take an hour to get through (more if you leave around 5ish).\n\nI've been avoiding flights due to the crazy bad for you radiation from the full body scanners. Maybe CLT will improve when I eventually cave and need to fly somewhere- who knows.	0
As nice as an airport can get.	1
The airport itself has not much to complain about, to me a typical airport with 5 terminals and none particularly difficult to get to. I connected here on all my visits to the airport, so did not have to deal with security and check in counter. What I really do not like in this airport are the employees in the restroom ASKING for tips when they hand you the paper towel to dry your hand. The bathrooms are not particularly clean, just like any public bathroom with a lot of people going in and out, so it's not like these airport employees are actually actively working. I see them congregate and chat with each other, but hand someone paper towel and ask for tip. BEWARE! go to a bathroom that's not serviced by these greedy people.	0
I travel for business for 11years. I had my share of airports. CLT needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas. Need to expand the roads.	0
Was just stopping through on our way to Las Vegas. \n\nIt was 7:00AM in the morning...the Starbucks line moved quickly...and everyone was friendly.\n\nThats enough for at least 4 stars :)	1
CLT is a pathetic airport for commuters who have to fly from smaller cities. The E concourse is getting further and furhter away from the gates to the flagship flights of US Airways. Half the time walking sidewalks are inoperable, and if you have less than 15 minutes (due to the wonderful on time of  US Airways Express (outsourced and don't care) then you will miss your flight. They could care less regardless of your status, and are now adding more gates at E.  (Up to 50 I believe, and no fast way to to get to B or C concourse). Obviously they care nothing about the deregulation that then the airlines elected the HUB and spoke philosophy. Trust me it DOES NOT work!  Will they ever listen to their customers, and especially the business traveler who kept them in business after 911 since we were the only ones who continued to fly.\nAt this point I don't think they care.	0
Is it a North Carolina thing to have bathroom attendants in every men's room, hustling to give you a piece of paper towel from the automatic dispenser and ingratiating himself for tips?  This is not a nightclub, right?  And if it is, it is the worst nightclub airport in the world.	0
CLT is a cool airport. Lots of eats..free internet...I find it easy in and out.. BUT it's busy. Who'd have thought in NC that an airport would be so busy. CLT has a very strict lightening procedures... they have several ground stops in the summer.. bring your laptop and good reading..	1
As a frequent flyer, I avoid this airport.  It seems that a preponderance of the time that I have the unavoidable misfortune of connecting through Charlotte Douglas something invariably goes wrong.  On a recent international flight, our arrival at the gate was delayed and our luggage retrieval was further delayed by 45 minutes due to a lack of ground crew and baggage handlers.  Typical mishaps for a poorly managed airport.  Please do yourself a favor and avoid this airport.	0
Hate hate hate flying... but being from Portland, OR where my family is from I fly here and there a couple times a year. Charlotte... could suck less but there are some things they are doing ok. \n\nIt is not really that hard to find  your way around but one of my big pet peaves is lots of displays and things like carts getting in the way of rushing to a terminal. Some of the walkways seem narrow  but that could be just me. Hate security here. I had one flight where I got delayed over night (at the airport for about 16hours) and the only thing I got was a t-shirt and some tooth hygiene things. Luckily a sweet lady who was one of those star partners(?) got me a alternative flight that got me home faster than the delayed plane would have.\n\nBesides all that at least CLT isn't Atlanta or Newark!	0
An international hub airport with that regional airport feel.  Take from that what you will.	0
I like CLT. I flew through here on my way from Philadelphia (my least favorite airport) to Fort Myers, FL, because it was cheaper. And I'm glad I did.\n\nThe way the airport is laid out in general is cool. Plenty of moving walkways too. Lots of good food options, and there's no lack in Starbucks. I did, however, get in the longest line, but it moved quickly and the workers were very happy and were even singing. :D\n\nThe Charlotte hub has to be my favorite for US Airways, since I hate PHL and I haven't been to PHX. Other than that, I'll be back! :D	1
Yea, they have rocking chairs, but what about service at the other end of the flight? I am still wwwwaaaaiiiittttiiiinnngggg for my bag from flight US 2618 from MEM. Been here 30 minutes and still wwwaaaaiiiiiitttttiiiinnnggg. Can't they find an industrial engineer to do a time study and develop a better plan for moving bags from E concourse to baggage claim? So I am writing this review while wwwaaaiiittttiiiinnnnnggg and have reduced my rating from 2 stars to 1. Can't go to zero so my review is done even if everyone from MEM is still wwwwaaaaaiiiiitttttiiiiinnnnggggg.......	0
Luggage took FOREVER to get.  Must have been standing there for at least 30 minutes.  Doh!	0
@ Charlotte and ready for boarding!!	0
I've had a few connections at CLT... usually due to missing another flight, as I regularly fly Air Canada and United, but sometimes end up on US Airways. Unlike my usual stops (Chicago, Washington, Newark), I have never had an issue in Charlotte. \n\nIt's small enough that it is simple to navigate in a short period of time. There are moving sidewalks (although they frown upon using them with a stroller) and some nice food options - both fast food and sit-down meals. Flights move in and out quickly without a huge domino effect with delays. I think I like Charlotte's airport, actually.\n\nSince I've only been here for connections, I can't comment on the check in area or the security checkpoint. Everything I've seen thus far, I like!\n\nOh, and the restrooms have a bathroom attendant. This means they are quite clean (for an airport restroom, anyway) and they have mouthwash and other goodies. Traveling with a small child? There are family restrooms available as well.	1
OK, so there's nothing horribly bad or incredibly wonderful about this airport, but the restroom attendants are totally creepy.  They're also unnecessary--there are plenty of airports that don't have creepy attendants and which have pristine restrooms.  The last thing I want in a public bathroom is some overly enthusiastic dude getting all up in my grill wishing me a wonderful day and trying to push paper towels into my hand.  The obnoxious obviousness for tips is annoying as well.  Why should I help subsidize the salary of an airport employee just because I took a whiz?  Get rid of these dookie denizens so people can do their business in peace and not get hit up for cash.	0
This airport has ridiculously long lines.  Overpriced food at airports is a given, but the sandwiches & wraps at Ciao were borderline edible.  And, over an hour delay for our flight due to construction on the runway.\n\nYes there are cute rocking chairs but they are usually occupied.	0
my reasoning of giving this airport 2 stars is only because its reallllly outdated, and im so used to SJC being so modern nice, and clean that i'm biased. there's 3 separate security check in lines which is great, but they're sure darn slow! only one person checking ID's and tickets. takes forever and a day without that 2nd person. not a whole lot of food choices as well, and their gift shops are very limited.	0
A clean, modern, relatively well-designed airport.  But be prepared to do some serious walking!  I don't know how it happens, but my connections through this airport are almost always at opposite ends of the place.  Lots of places to eat and a pleasant sitting area nearby.  It really needs a train or something because even with the moving sidewalks, the amount of walking is excessive.  Pretty sure they have free wi-fi.	1
"I like CLT for a \""bigger\"" airport.   Parking costs me $4 a day which is crazy cheap.  THe food isn't bad, there are some decent stores, and cool rocking chairs.  The secret to the security is check in on the end @ D+E.   Barely ever a line and when there is it moves faster for some odd reason.  Overall never had a problem here and its one of my favorite \""bigger\"" airports."	1
Nice clean airport from what I could see.  We were on a 90 minute lay over on our way home and it was late.  There were still some places open which was nice.  Easy to get around.  Didn't have to worry about security as we were in the same wing.  I even managed to get ice in my was from US Air....not that has anything to do with the airport but I felt the need.	1
Another airport another day of hurry up and wait ! \n\nCLT is really a pretty cool airport, moving sidewalks a large food court, some nice Art and even a statue of the Queen outside, Charlotte is known as the Queen City. \n\nOh yea, the TSA opened their checkpoint at 5:15 AM, my flight boarded at 5:35, get there and in line early.\n\nDue to the scrutiny of airport security, I can only award 4 stars.	1
For some reason, I found this airport to be kind of depressing.  The fact that I arrived here after a red-eye from Phoenix didn't help make it any less depressing.  Compared to other really nice airports I have been to (Phoenix Sky Harbor, LAX, Detroit...), the rugs and chairs and pretty much everything at Charlotte-Douglas International seemed kind of old.  Perhaps it was just the particular terminal I was in (US Airways...never flying with them again, but that's another story), and maybe the rest of the airport isn't quite so bad.  I've only been here once, so I wouldn't know.\n\nBut still, it's an airport.  It's meant to be a place to board and disembark from planes.  And it suits that purpose just fine, but I prefer airports that are nice to wander around at during a layover  This one isn't.	0
I connected through CLT on a recent trip. I have to say, as a former resident of the Charlotte area, and after experiencing the ease of my home airport (Dallas-Fort Worth Int'l), this airport could be so much better.\n\nIt seems that CLT just keeps building on to itself and is making itself bigger and stretched so far that it is now a chore to have a connecting flight there.	0
worst airport experience EVER...everyone was extremely rude....a lady at the information desk ignored us while talking it up with her boyfriend..but to start....the customs process takes FOREVER. they ask the most inappropriate questions ( how come you and your girlfriend arent married?). rude rude rude...then the whole TSA  experience OMG... lines 250 people deep and you can see other people naked on the x ray screens and they will actually pat your testicles... we only had a hour and a half layover  on the same plane in the same seats with the same luggage ....my girlfriends luggage still hasnt shown up even though they charged us 100$ for the 2 checked bags ( us airways doesnt tell you they charge you 2x for your bags even though its a round trip..who am i to assume the initial 50 in the round trip confirmation wasnt enough or was i to assume that US airways expects you to come home with less luggage then you go on vacation with (gifts??? duh)).....worst experience ever....bathrooms were out of paper, piss everywhere, and we almost missed our connection ON THE SAME PLANE	0
"What kind employees in Charlotte! I received more \""have a nice days\"" than Forrest Gump could ever have imagined! These folks are happy at their jobs....the food prep folks, cashiers, washroom attendants, and airline peeps working the gates must all be drinking the same joyful water! This airport is clean, organized, and roomy enough for a good amount of traffic to not feel cramped. And the rocking chairs in the common areas that still have all the modern conveniences for charging the toys makes it feel like home away from home. No wonder everyone was ordering smaller lattes that day - the warmth of this airport already had them feeling cozy :)"	1
Niiiice airport. I usually fly through Atlanta, but happened to have a rare return connection on a recent flight thru here. What I love most is the ambiance -- very modern and open. Cool structural artwork like airplanes in the atrium. Everything was festively decorated for the holidays. And there was a friggin' pianist playing jazzed up holiday tunes on a grand piano. Classy!\n\nLogistics are mostly good too. Signage is easy to read and follow. Tons of moving walkways to help you navigate more quickly. Which you may need to do since the terminals are unfortunately spread out, and there's no way between but by foot. That would admittedly suck if you were on a tight connx. My food choices sort of fell in the middle; but I've definitely experienced worse.	1
THE MALL OF AIRPORTS!!!!\n\nThis airport is HUGE, I mean really! It's waaaay bigger than LAX in Los Angeles, and has so many really nice stores that you can forget that you were actually in an airport.\n\nI was simply changing flights, and didn't have much time to do any shopping, but this is a place that someone could spend the afternoon shopping in. Even the restaurants were a step up from what you would usually expect from an airport.\n\nThey should change the name to:\nCharlotte-Douglas MALL / International Airport \n\n:p	1
I usually have to connect here and it's not too bad. It's a bit sprawling but it's clean. I like the rocking chairs and free wifi as well as the live piano player they sometimes have by the sushi bar. Plus, there's a Pinkberry! It's at the entrance to terminal D. I can't speak for customs, parking, or going through security because I've only had connections here.	1
Easy to navigate and lots of shops.  LaCoste inside an airport???	1
(2.75 stars)  Charlotte-Douglas may be my favorite large airport in the Eastern US.  The arrangement of terminals is easy to maneuver, while the terminals themselves are well-lit and airy.  There are many dining and drinking options, and cool rocking chairs.  The gate waiting areas are too small, but there are better areas to wait.  The car rental experience is on-site and efficient.  TSA Security at Charlotte-Douglas seems to be able to expand during busy periods, and hasn't caused me any issues in dozens of flights.  While not close to downtown, getting to the airport (or from airport to city) has always been smooth.  The information booth folks are actually helpful; quite a change if you're arriving from Miami or NY/JFK.  A very late arriving flight once caused me to miss a connection and on that particular night finding a nearby motel was pretty easy.	0
After Nashville, this is one of my favorite airports.  It just always seems clean, friendly, easy to go from terminal to terminal, not a lot of delays since it's not in a bad winter weather region.. That's really all I ask for in an airport.  That, and a few good places to grab a cocktail pre-boarding.  There are several of those in the main area, and a nice and clean food court, plus a Body Shop and some other little boutique stores.  I've only transferred through here so cannot speak of the security and checkin services.	1
The airport is easy to get out of and easy to get to.\n\nTSA is as slow as they can be.\nToo many agents to few open lines.	1
Compared to other airports I like CLT!  They have gotten a little slow on getting gate checked bags to us.  Each bathroom has an attendant and is always clean.	1
Very outdated, and super crowded. It is nearly impossible to walk in a straight line, and there is not nearly enough seating in the concourse.\n\nBoarding was very chaotic, as there was really no where to stand or line up without getting in everyone else's  way.	0
"Nice airport with free Wi FI and some very good restaurants.  Relatively easy to navigate and non-smoking.  As \""Justin A\"" pointed out in his review, they have charging centers for your electronics which I love.  My cell phone battery just doesn't last as long as it used to.  I also was surprised to see that each bathroom has an attendant with mints and mouthwash and the bathrooms are always clean."	1
Not a bad place for layovers. Plenty of food places and variety of stores. It's nice, clean, and always under new build of the next big thing. I had many visits here and always pretty happy about the airport itself. The food at the food court could be better though.	1
I've now flown through here a couple of times for business in Charlotte.  It's a nice airport, decent places to eat/snack, etc.  I've not had any problems flying in our out.\n\nThe airport is pretty clean and, while car rental requires a shuttle, it's a quick shuttle ride and the shuttles are frequent.\n\nThey do have free wi-fi but, it's a bit of a pain in the ass to connect...you have to wait through a stupid AOL advertising video.  Really?  AOL?  you have got to be kidding, right?\n\nOne very odd thing...they have bathroom attendants.  Yes.  Really.  In every restroom there is an attendant who hands you paper towels to dry your hands and goes around keeping the bathrooms clean.  They are VERY clean, some of the cleanest I have ever been in for an airport.  But, then you feel guilty because you should really tip these guys.  But, I usually don't travel with much cash, so, I didn't have any money for a tip....sad	1
It is actually one of the smoothest airports to navigate and has quite a variety of food options, both healthy and fast food.  The staff, for the most part, are quite accommodating and all the facilities, terminals, and decor are modern and clean looking.  It is a busy airport but you don't get the rushed feeling like you do at O'Hare International	1
Not bad I'm assuming this is the hub for us airways since the entire airport is for us airways. A lot better airport to transfer than any other one I've been a lot of food court and space and is clean! However I don't think I'm a big fan of us airways at all. My whole flight from SF to Charlotte had no service since its over night. \n\nthe airport is not to crowded but that could be me since i was there at 8:00 am. If I was to take a transfer fight i would def try to look for a transfer flight over here.	1
Your Free Wi-Fi is totally useless. Maybe you should spring a couple of bucks and throw it in as a reliable courtesy instead of having AOL sponsor. AOL is about as relevant as Windows 3.1; isn't it neat how you don't have to type those DOS prompts anymore? No, really though, we'd prefer a service that works for a fee than one that doesn't for free. Thanks for screwing up 2 hours of my day in which I planned to get some work done at the airport! YOU GOT MAIL (AOL voice)	0
A nice quiet airport with plenty of shopping. The womens restroom has a bathroom attendant and is very clean	1
Free wifi but not much range. Decent food selection. Go with Salsarita Breakfast Burritos! Wish there was a local alternative to Starbucks. It really isnt good coffee people. \nIf you see an older pilot, don't try to be nice to them. They are disgruntled. You would be too if your company took over a million dollars of your pension away while upper management all took bonuses.	1
"Like long lines and employees who LIE than CLT is the place for you. I was flying US airs and they are just as awful. This place is a joke and I will no longer be flying anywhere what would require using CLT. I had my husband 1 baby 1 4 yr old and my 70 yr old grandmother and they told me to go through the family line for security. I went through and this rude \""renta cop\"" said that the line was ONLY for employees, pushed us into another line that took 45 minutes to get through. I turn around and hes letting everyone and their brother go through that line. He just didnt want to deal with the stroller or the kids. HES AN ASS!"	0
This isn't my home airport so I'm always just flying through but it's definitely one of my favorites. The rocking chairs alone make it memorable but I also love the occasional live music from the grand piano in the central area. Food is meh, Starbucks is essential, and the moving walkways are fun/helpful except when people can't read the directions. Bank of America ATMs all over the place and several shops to help kill time between connections.	1
haben nicht wirklich viel vom Flughafen gesehen, da wir dort lediglich zwei Mal umgestiegen sind. Allerdings hat die Einreise \u00fcber 2 Std gedauert und der Anschlussflug schien gef\u00e4hrdet. Hat aber alles problemlos geklappt, auch wenn es etwas hektisch wurde	1
Very well kept and entertaining airport.... I have flown here before as a connecting airport and have never had any problems... And to top it all off the bars have an excellent beer selection... I will try and make my connecting flights here more often...	1
I like this airport because:\n- It has jamba juice\n- It has lots of flights and connections\n- It is clean and the people are pretty friendly\n\nMy complaint?\n- walkways are WAYYYYYYYY too narrow for the volume of people walking down each concourse	1
Clean and spacious airport with lots of food and shopping options. My only complaint is their lack of outlets in the boarding areas. Really? Apparently they're all hanging out in the walkway area with trees and white rocking chairs(across from Burger King food area).	1
Half hour layover turned into an hour plus. Here's why: out of 2 gates 3 flights are being called: fort Lauderdale, Albany, Philly. \nSo first they called first class of each flight. Except all of them were yelling over each other. Plus people literally elbowing and smacking each other with cranky kids. Etc. \n\nHowever, punch line : not airport fault, the winner is US Airways who just announced that they have stopped boarding the FLL flight as their is an armrest on a seat that needs to be fixed. \n\nSo help me god, I don't care. I'll sit in that chair. \n\nEither way someone just trampled over me and kicked my broiling new cup of caramel macchiato which is leaving a huge stain on the carpet. \n\nCall me crazy... I don't feel bad. \n\nWhat has your airline and airport done for YOU lately????????	0
The heaven of domestic airports.\n\nCame here for connecting flights to the Caribbean.\n\nHighlights:\n-Free Wi-fi\n- Amazing customer service at restaurants (there are a ton of them)\n- Escalator things everywhere for the lazy\n- Big, open room to roam around\n- Many seats for you to sit wherever you would like - not next to the family with three crying babies\n- Clear signs everywhere\n- The airport is not a maze and is a simple shape you will understand right away\n- COFFEE & OUTLETS EVERYWHERE\n\nI love a good caffeine charge and a phone at full battery.\n\nYes, it's a small airport, but let LAX be an example of what a big airport is like. (LAX is one of the few reasons I hate to travel)\n\nGo to the Body Shop if you are bored (center of the airport). They hooked me up with a lot of lotion samples for my travels!	1
I spend way too much of my life in this airport... but, as far as major airports go, its not so bad. They have a decent selection of restaurants and shops, many a Starbuck, and a good place for a massage. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: I usually park my tired behind in the US airways club and sleep, but when I'm in the mood to venture out, this airport has a pretty good selection of fun things to do while you wait for the next air taxi.	1
Bigger airport than one would think. Very busy and always on the move. Easy to get around however.	1
I love Charlotte Douglas International airport and rate this place highly.However on visiting the toilets  several times recently the toilet seats were old and cracked, not at all beffiting this show case.They weren't up to standards in my oppinion.\nIf they can afford $multi million for a new concourse then a trip to Lowes is peanuts.	1
As far as airports are concerned, this one stacks up well.  TSA gets you through security pretty quick.  My flights have almost always departed on time.  All the terminals are in the same building.  \n\nThere are also plenty of options where food is concerned.  My favorite part is that there's a Bojangles inside.  You could feasibly bring Bojangles to another state!  Seriously, how awesome is that?  The only downside is that each terminal has different food, so it may be a long walk, depending on where you are flying.	1
For some reason I always have to connect between terminal E and terminal A. As a hub it's pretty busy so hoof it to your next gate!	0
Basically the totally opposite of Newark Liberty Airport.\n\nClean and well-lit. Friendly and courteous TSA members, and fast and efficient layout and service.	1
+ Relax on the rocking chairs\n+ Countless dining options\n+ Shopping and massage places to pass the time\n+ Plenty of seating at all the gates\n+ FREE WIFI!	1
I love this airport.  Clean, open, easy to manage, and the stores are open longer than many places I've been to which is great when your travel plans have you up and out all day and night.	1
Clean, Tidy, and promp with service and hospitality. Getting from gate and gate is efficient especially when you go from the main ones over to the far end for flying out on the much smaller jets.	1
It was a pass through. When I stopped by, it was pretty crowded and there was a dearth of outlets	0
"An airport on the smaller side. I dropped by here as a stopover on the way back to Norfolk from Atlanta. Cute airport and obviously on its way to becoming a \""big\"" one. You'll find all the food you need. It's easy to find your way around and you get free wi fi! Airports get extra points for the wifi =)"	1
It's tough living in Charlotte. If you have to check a bag it usually takes the bag longer to make it from the airplane to baggage claim than it takes to fly it from MEM to CLT - must be the highly efficient union labor...	0
Free wifi, gotta love small airports.  Easy in and easy out.	1
Pretty easy getting through the airport to baggage to my shuttle.  Lots of hotel choices nearby and then back again really early in the morning.  Multiple lines for security and any of them will work, stay away from gate B line as they have less scanners and you compete with the priority and first class lines, unless you're flying first of course.  A few shopping places, some barbecue, and Jamba all in the airport while you're waiting for your flight.	1
Decent run of the mill airport. It's nice inside and definitely had a load of amenities and a plethora of food options. \n\nMy favorite part? It was nice to be in such a large place with so many people and it actually be CLEAN :)	1
Clean, decent set up, hallways are not wide enough though making it extremely trafficy to walk through. There is a good selection of restaurants though!	1
seriously? concierge service and tip jars in the bathrooms? but what happens if no one tips? (shudder)	1
Weird airport setup. Not really a fan.	0
First time there. I must admit that the facility does have its priorities in order. Everything I could see was spotless and well maintained. The place had a wide variety of shops in the concourse for travellers passing by to their next destination. First time flying US Airways was and pleased at the experience. It reminded me of the days back before the United Continental merger. Continental always had consistent friendly service and majority of on-time arrivals. Generous portions of drink beverages and inflight snacks	1
Always a good airport when you have free Wifi. Nice place. Well designed. Medium Size Airport.	1
Gross, effektiv, schnell und kurze Wege. Das ist furmuns der Flughafen Charlotte, den wir 2 Mal im Jahr nutzen. Fur mich mein nach Las Vegas mein Lieblings Flughafen in den USA. \nEr bietet nichts besonders, sondern ist einfach ein gut organisierter Flughafen, wo uns meistens unser Schwiegersohn runterholt denn er ist dort Air traffic Controller fg\nLetztes Jahr den Rekord in der Immigratio aufgestellt: 15 Minuten und wir waren durch. Okay, wir sa\u00dfen auch in Reihe 5 und waren dementsprechend schnell drau\u00dfen aus dem Flieger.	1
This place is pretty nice.  Looks relatively new and is pretty clean.  Good spots to eat and shop.  Terminal is easy to navigate.  I would not be upset if I had a layover here in the future.	1
Pretty standard big airport layout, the usual food and stores. +1 star for the awesome rocking chairs...because EVERYONE should have rocking chairs!!	1
I go through here if I get stuck on U.S. Airways but I actually don't mind connecting through here at all.  Even though there isn't a train/tram system to my knowledge, I never feel in a rush.  There are plenty of people movers/moving sidewalks so I am always able to get to my connecting gate w/o anything but a leisurely stroll.  Food options include Chili's, CPK, BK, and Cinnabon.  Despite being inside an airport, the pecan roll was one of the best I've ever had (just keeping it real).  If you Yelp while inside the airport itself there was a decent modern sushi, asian-fusion, independent IIRC but I can't remember the name.\n\nRestrooms were actually clean.  There are even some higher end boutique-ey stores like Costa etc. w/ a nice modern white uniform row storefront along the moving sidewalks.	1
